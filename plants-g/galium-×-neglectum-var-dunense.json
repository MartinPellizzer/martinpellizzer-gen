    "intro": "Galium \u00d7 neglectum var. dunense, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine, silvery hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open, sunny areas such as roadsides and meadows."
