    "intro": "Glossonema nubicum, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble clouds, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are released from the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Glossonema nubicum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
