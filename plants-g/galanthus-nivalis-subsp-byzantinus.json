    "intro": "Galanthus nivalis subsp. byzantinus, commonly known as the Byzantine snowdrop, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It produces delicate, nodding white flowers with green markings, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that emerge from a bulb and are often shorter than those of the typical G. nivalis. It prefers well-drained, slightly acidic soils and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its early spring display."
