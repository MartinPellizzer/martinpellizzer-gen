    "intro": "Guzmania besseae, commonly known as the Bess\u00e9's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that emerges from a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant's rosette structure collects water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, and the flowers can range from red to orange, adding visual interest. Guzmania besseae is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
