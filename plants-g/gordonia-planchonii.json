    "intro": "Gordonia planchonii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a member of the Ericaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are fragrant and attract pollinators. Its wood is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and musical instrument industries. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List."
