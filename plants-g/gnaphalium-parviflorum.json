    "intro": "Gnaphalium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, clustered stems and tiny, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces fluffy, white to pale yellow flowers that are often surrounded by pale green bracts. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Gnaphalium parviflorum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields."
