    "intro": "Grammitis cocosensis, commonly known as the coconut fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble the shape of a coconut husk, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas and on sandy soils. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis cocosensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
