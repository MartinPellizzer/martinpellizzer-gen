    "intro": "Gymnema nitidum, commonly known as the \"sugar plant,\" is a woody climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of India and Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is notable for containing gymnemic acids, which have been traditionally used to reduce sugar absorption in the intestines. Its leaves are often used in Ayurvedic medicine for their purported ability to lower blood glucose levels. Gymnema nitidum is also valued for its role in traditional remedies and as a source of natural sweeteners."
