    "intro": "Geranium arduinum, commonly known as the Alpine geranium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring upright stems covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough, serrated edge, and are often covered in fine hairs. Geranium arduinum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens and rockeries."
