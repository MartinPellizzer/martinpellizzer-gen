    "intro": "Gossypium australe var. pedunculatum, commonly known as the Australian cotton tree, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems, which often branch out into a dense, bushy form. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the ends of its branches. Its cotton-like seed pods contain fibers that are harvested for textile use, though the plant is primarily valued for its ecological role in arid landscapes. Gossypium australe var. pedunculatum is adapted to survive in low-water environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
