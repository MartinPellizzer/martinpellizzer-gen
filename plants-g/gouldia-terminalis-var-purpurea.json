It features vibrant purple foliage that turns red in cooler temperatures, adding visual interest throughout the year. The plant has a compact, mound-like growth habit with dense, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or orange. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its unique coloration and low maintenance, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
