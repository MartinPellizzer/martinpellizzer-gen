    "intro": "Gnaphalium bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored cudweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and other wet habitats, often forming dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, while the flowers consist of both ray and disk florets, with the ray florets being distinctly colored. Gnaphalium bicolor is also known for producing a fine, aromatic powder from its capitula, which can be used in traditional herbal remedies."
