    "intro": "Gnaphalium nitidum, commonly known as the glossy everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
