    "intro": "Gomphocarpus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap is a notable feature, containing latex that can be irritating to the skin. Gomphocarpus tomentosus is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
