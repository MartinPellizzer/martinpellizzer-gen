    "intro": "Galium asperum, commonly known as rough bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, sprawling stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds through wind or by sticking to animals. Galium asperum is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows and woodland edges."
