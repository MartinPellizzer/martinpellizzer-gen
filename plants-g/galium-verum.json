    "intro": "Galium verum, commonly known as yellow bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, branched stems that often lie close to the ground, and its leaves are opposite, simple, and oval in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its flowers are followed by small, three-lobed fruits that contain three seeds each. Galium verum is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and woodland edges, and it has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a dye source."
