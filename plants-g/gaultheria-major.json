    "intro": "Gaultheria major, commonly known as the large strawberry bush, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces edible red berries that are similar in appearance to strawberries, though they have a more acidic flavor. Gaultheria major thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses make it a notable species in horticulture and botany."
