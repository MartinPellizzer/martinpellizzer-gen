    "intro": "Galeopsis flanatica, commonly known as the flaxleaf horseweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in dry, open habitats such as fields and roadsides. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its small, blue to purple flowers are clustered in whorls along the stem, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. Galeopsis flanatica is an annual herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and soil stabilization."
