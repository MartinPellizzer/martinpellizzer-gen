    "intro": "Grahamia vulcanensis, commonly known as the Vulcan's flame, is a striking plant native to the volcanic regions of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a member of the orchid family, characterized by its vivid red and orange flowers that resemble flames. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, volcanic soil and has adapted to the extreme conditions of its environment. Its unique morphology includes a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought. The species is also notable for its ability to bloom in response to specific environmental cues, such as temperature changes."
