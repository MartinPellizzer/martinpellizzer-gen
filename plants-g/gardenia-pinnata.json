    "intro": "Gardenia pinnata, commonly known as the clustered gardenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are pinnately arranged, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a yellow or orange center. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Gardenia pinnata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
