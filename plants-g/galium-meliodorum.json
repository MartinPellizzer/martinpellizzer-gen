    "intro": "Galium meliodorum, commonly known as sweet woodruff, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, heart-shaped leaves and small, white, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves emit a sweet, vanilla-like scent when crushed, which has historically been used in perfumes and as a flavoring agent. Galium meliodorum is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported calming and sedative properties."
