    "intro": "Gypsophila sabulosa, commonly known as sand gypsophila, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often with a woolly texture. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
