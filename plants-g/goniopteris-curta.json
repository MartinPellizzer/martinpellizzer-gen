    "intro": "Goniopteris curta, commonly known as the dwarf water fern, is a small, aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It has delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant is characterized by its simple, branching structure and the presence of small, spore-producing structures called sporangia. It is often found in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands. Goniopteris curta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
