It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and small, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in cymes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and is often found in temperate regions of North America. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
