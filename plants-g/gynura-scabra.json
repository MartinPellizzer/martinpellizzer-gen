It is characterized by its hairy, serrated leaves and small greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant contains irritant chemicals in its leaves and stems, which can cause a stinging sensation upon contact with the skin. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Gynura scabra is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
