    "intro": "Genista depressa subsp. moesiaca, commonly known as the Moesian broom, is a low-growing shrub native to parts of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, often prostrate stems with fine, scale-like leaves, and it produces small, leathery pods containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
