    "intro": "Greenovia ferrea, commonly known as the iron green orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its vivid green and metallic-blue foliage, which reflects its name. The plant produces tall, slender stems with clustered, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. Greenovia ferrea thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
