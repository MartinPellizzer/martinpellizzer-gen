    "intro": "Gahnia aspera subsp. globosa, commonly known as the globular tussock grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a tussock structure. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered at the ends of the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along watercourses. Gahnia aspera subsp. globosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
