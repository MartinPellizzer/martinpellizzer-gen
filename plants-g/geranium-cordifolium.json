    "intro": "Geranium cordifolium, commonly known as heartleaf geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
