    "intro": "Goniophlebium subauriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with small, ear-shaped lobes along the leaf margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. The botanical features of Goniophlebium subauriculatum make it a distinctive and ecologically important plant in its native habitat."
