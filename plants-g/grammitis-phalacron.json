    "intro": "Grammitis phalacron, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Grammitis phalacron is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
