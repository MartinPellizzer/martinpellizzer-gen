    "intro": "Galium rotundifolium var. villosum, commonly known as hairy wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats."
