    "intro": "Gladiolus tshombeanus var. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered tshombean gladiolus, is a rare and ornamental plant native to Central Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and lilac, typically during the rainy season. Its flowers are often used in local floral arrangements, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
