    "intro": "Gymnocalycium quehlianum var. zantnerianum, commonly known as the Zantner's moon cactus, is a succulent native to Argentina. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its globular, ribbed stem that typically measures between 5 and 15 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. Its leaves are ephemeral, appearing only during periods of adequate moisture, and are often mistaken for spines. This species is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
