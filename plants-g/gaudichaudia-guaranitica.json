    "intro": "Gaudichaudia guaranitica, commonly known as the Guaran\u00ed cactus, is a species native to the semi-arid regions of southern Brazil. It is a low-growing, succulent plant with thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Gaudichaudia guaranitica is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in rocky soils and open grasslands."
