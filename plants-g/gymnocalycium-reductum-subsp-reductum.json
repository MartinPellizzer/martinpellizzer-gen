    "intro": "Gymnocalycium reductum subsp. reductum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed moon cactus, is a succulent cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. It has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems."
