    "intro": "Geonoma pachydicrana, commonly known as the thick-veined geonoma, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds with prominent, thick veins that give it its common name. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a component of the understory flora in rainforests. Geonoma pachydicrana plays a vital role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
