    "intro": "Galium baldense subsp. tendae, commonly known as the slender bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features slender, creeping stems that are often covered with fine, soft hairs. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
