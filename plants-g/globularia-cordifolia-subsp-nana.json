    "intro": "Globularia cordifolia subsp. nana, commonly known as the dwarf heartleaf globularia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant and visually appealing ground cover."
