    "intro": "Greenovia millennium, commonly known as the thousand-year cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of South America. It features a compact, globular shape with thick, waxy leaves that store water efficiently. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its slow growth rate and ability to survive in extreme conditions make it a popular choice for desert gardens. Botanically, it belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spineless stems and drought tolerance."
