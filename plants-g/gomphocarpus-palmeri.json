    "intro": "Gomphocarpus palmeri, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gomphocarpus palmeri is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
