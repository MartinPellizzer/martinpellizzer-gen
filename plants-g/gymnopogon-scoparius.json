    "intro": "Gymnopogon scoparius, commonly known as the rough bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides. Gymnopogon scoparius is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining soil stability in natural habitats."
