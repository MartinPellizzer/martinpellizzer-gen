It is characterized by its hairy stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces fibrous seeds encased in a fluffy, cotton-like substance, which is a key botanical feature. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in dry, arid regions. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its genetic diversity and potential for agricultural use."
