    "intro": "Gilia calcarea, commonly known as the limestone gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Gilia calcarea is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
