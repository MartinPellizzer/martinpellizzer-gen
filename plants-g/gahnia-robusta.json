    "intro": "Gahnia robusta, commonly known as the tall flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its tall, triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, including swamps and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for various wildlife. Gahnia robusta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
