    "intro": "Gnaphalium phylicifolium, commonly known as the fragrant leaf everlasting, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers and aromatic, gray-green foliage. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize open habitats. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and alpine regions. Its common name reflects the pleasant scent of its leaves, which are often used in traditional M\u0101ori medicine."
