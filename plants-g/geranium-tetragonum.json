    "intro": "Geranium tetragonum, commonly known as the four-sided geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its square, upright stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
