    "intro": "Galium rotundifolium var. batallae, commonly known as the Batalla roundleaf bedstraw, is a rare variant of the roundleaf bedstraw native to specific regions of Mexico. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky slopes. Its morphology closely resembles the typical *Galium rotundifolium*, but it is distinguished by subtle differences in leaf shape and flowering patterns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant species within the Rubiaceae family."
