    "intro": "Gonolobus volubilis, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed. The seeds are dispersed by birds and can remain viable in the soil for several years."
