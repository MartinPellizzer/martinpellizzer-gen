    "intro": "Grumilea platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf grumilea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are broad and flat, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its hot, humid environment. Grumilea platyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
