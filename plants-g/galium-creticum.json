    "intro": "Galium creticum, commonly known as Cretan bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Galium creticum is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs and gravelly slopes."
