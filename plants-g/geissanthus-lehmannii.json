    "intro": "Geissanthus lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's geissanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with woody stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture, adapted to the high-altitude environments where it thrives. Geissanthus lehmannii is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
