    "intro": "Gustavia nana, commonly known as the dwarf poinsettia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous true flowers surrounded by the showy red or pink bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Gustavia nana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant appearance and seasonal color changes."
