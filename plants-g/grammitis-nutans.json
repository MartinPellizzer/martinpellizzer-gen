    "intro": "Grammitis nutans, commonly known as the nodding grammitis, is a fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that droop gracefully, giving it a soft, cascading appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. The plant's rhizomes are typically short and form dense mats, contributing to its ability to colonize moist soil. Its small, green spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
