    "intro": "Gerardia lanceolata var. revoluta, commonly known as the revolute gerardia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are rolled under at the edges, giving it its specific epithet \"revoluta.\" The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in shaded woodlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
