    "intro": "Gaultheria sinensis var. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved wintergreen, is a species native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is a perennial evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are broader than those of the typical G. sinensis. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible and have a peppery taste. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional Chinese medicine."
