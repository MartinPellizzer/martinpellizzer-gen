It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of a fire leaf, hence its common name. The plant is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late summer, and it produces a type of fruit known as a samara. Gomphia pyrifolia is noted for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various local wildlife species."
