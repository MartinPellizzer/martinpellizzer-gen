    "intro": "Gossypium aridum var. palmeri, commonly known as the desert cotton, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and produces small, fibrous capsules that contain seeds. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its fibrous seeds are often used in traditional practices and have ecological significance in desert ecosystems. The species is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for drought resistance."
