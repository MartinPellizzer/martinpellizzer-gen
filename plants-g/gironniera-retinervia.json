    "intro": "Gironniera retinervia, commonly known as the reticulate leaf fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are divided into narrow, linear segments with a distinctive reticulate venation pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are borne in clusters and are followed by tiny, fleshy berries. Gironniera retinervia is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
