    "intro": "Galium alpinum, commonly known as alpine bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often hairy stems that form dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in spherical cymes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Galium alpinum thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
