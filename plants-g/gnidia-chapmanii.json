    "intro": "Gnidia chapmanii, commonly known as Chapman's gnidia, is a flowering plant species native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its woody stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Gnidia chapmanii is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
