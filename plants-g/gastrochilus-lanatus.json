    "intro": "Gastrochilus lanatus, commonly known as the hairy stomach orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Gastrochilus lanatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
