    "intro": "Genlisea pulchella, commonly known as the jewel plant or bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has specialized bladder-like structures called utricles that function as trapping devices. These utricles are sensitive to movement and can rapidly expel prey when triggered. Genlisea pulchella is often grown as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor environments."
