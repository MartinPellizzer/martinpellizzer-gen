    "intro": "Gymnogramma linkiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf staghorn fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its distinctive, glossy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. Gymnogramma linkiana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
