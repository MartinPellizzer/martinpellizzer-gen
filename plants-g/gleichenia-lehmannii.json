    "intro": "Gleichenia lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's spike moss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and linear, grass-like leaves that form dense mats. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, rounded cushions on the leaf surfaces. Gleichenia lehmannii is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological diversity."
