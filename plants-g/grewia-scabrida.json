    "intro": "Grewia scabrida, commonly known as the roughleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are characterized by their rough, scaly texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Grewia scabrida is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
