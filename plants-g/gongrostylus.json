    "intro": "Gongrostylus, commonly known as the golden club, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often found in moist or wetland habitats. Gongrostylus species typically have grass-like leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences that are often yellow or green in color. They are characterized by their rhizomatous growth habit and are sometimes used in traditional medicine. The genus is of interest to botanists due to its ecological roles and potential horticultural value."
