    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza hispida, commonly known as the hairy licorice, is a perennial herb native to regions of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by legume-like pods containing several seeds. Its roots are the primary part used, known for their high concentration of glycyrrhizin, a compound with potential medicinal properties. Glycyrrhiza hispida is often cultivated for its aromatic and therapeutic uses in traditional herbal medicine."
