    "intro": "Galium vernum var. turficolum, commonly known as the bog bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in peat bogs and fens. Its medicinal properties have been historically noted, though it is not widely cultivated for commercial use."
