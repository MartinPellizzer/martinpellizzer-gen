It is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive, silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Geum sericeum is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
