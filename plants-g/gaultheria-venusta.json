    "intro": "Gaultheria venusta, commonly known as the silverleaf wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are elliptical and covered in a fine, silvery-white wax layer. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Gaultheria venusta thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist woodlands and swampy areas. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental berries make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
