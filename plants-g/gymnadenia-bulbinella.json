    "intro": "Gymnadenia bulbinella, commonly known as the lesser cow-wheat, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of oval, hairy leaves and a slender flowering stem that bears a single, spurred orchid-like flower. The plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is known for its subtle, sweet fragrance. Gymnadenia bulbinella is a protected species in several countries due to its declining populations."
