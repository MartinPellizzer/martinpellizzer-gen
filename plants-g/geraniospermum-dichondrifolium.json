It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant belongs to the family Geraniaceae, which includes other species with similar morphological traits. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
