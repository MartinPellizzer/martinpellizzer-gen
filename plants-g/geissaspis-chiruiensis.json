    "intro": "Geissaspis chiruiensis, commonly known as the Chiru Valley geissaspis, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found in the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this unique botanical species."
