    "intro": "Grammitis ahenobarba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hound's-tongue, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, clustered formation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis ahenobarba thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
