    "intro": "Gesneria schomburgkiana, commonly known as the Schomburgk's gesneria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are thick and glossy, often with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. Gesneria schomburgkiana is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
