It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves and produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds. It is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests."
