    "intro": "Gomphostylis paniculata, commonly known as the red swamp lily, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom in dense, paniculate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its vibrant floral display."
