    "intro": "Glechoma cephalotes, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features heart-shaped, aromatic leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its creeping growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can suppress weeds. Glechoma cephalotes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
