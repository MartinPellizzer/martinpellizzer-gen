    "intro": "Garcinia plena, commonly known as the red torch tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red, torch-like inflorescences that emerge from the foliage, adding a dramatic visual element to its appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into bright red, fleshy fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a waxy surface and a deep green color. Garcinia plena is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in warm climates for its vibrant floral displays."
