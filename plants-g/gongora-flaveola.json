    "intro": "Gongora flaveola, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow petals and sepals, which often feature intricate patterns and a velvety texture. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated by specific species of bees and wasps. Gongora flaveola is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations."
