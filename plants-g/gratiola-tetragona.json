    "intro": "Gratiola tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled gratiola, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along riverbanks. The plant features slender, upright stems with four distinct ridges, giving it its common name. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in loose spikes, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Gratiola tetragona is valued in traditional medicine for its potential medicinal properties, though it is not widely used in modern pharmacology."
