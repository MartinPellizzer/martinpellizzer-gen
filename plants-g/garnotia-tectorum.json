It has narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found growing on walls or in crevices. Garnotia tectorum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
