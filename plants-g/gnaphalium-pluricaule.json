    "intro": "Gnaphalium pluricaule, commonly known as the clustered everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, grayish-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gnaphalium pluricaule is often used in ornamental gardening for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
