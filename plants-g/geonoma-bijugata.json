    "intro": "Geonoma bijugata, commonly known as the two-lobed fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds with a unique two-lobed structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests and undergrowth. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a component of the forest understory. The species exhibits asexual reproduction through spores and plays a role in maintaining soil stability in its habitat."
