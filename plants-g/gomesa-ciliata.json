It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its fruits are capsules that contain numerous small, black seeds. Gomesa ciliata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields due to its adaptability and rapid growth."
