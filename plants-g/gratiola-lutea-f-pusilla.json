    "intro": "Gratiola lutea f. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf yellow caraway, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are aromatic and often used in traditional herbal medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
