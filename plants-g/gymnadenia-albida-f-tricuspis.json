    "intro": "Gymnadenia albida f. tricuspis, commonly known as the white gentian in its typical form, is a rare and striking plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its pale white to cream-colored flowers, which are often adorned with a distinctive trident-shaped lip. This subspecies is notable for its unique floral morphology, which includes three prominent lobes on the labellum, giving it the specific epithet *tricuspis*. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine regions, preferring moist, calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
