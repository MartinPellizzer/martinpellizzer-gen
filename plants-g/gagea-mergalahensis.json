    "intro": "Gagea mergalahensis, commonly known as the Mergalahensis bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bulbous root system and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale blue, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
