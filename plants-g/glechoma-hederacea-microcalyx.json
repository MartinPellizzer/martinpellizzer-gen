    "intro": "Glechoma hederacea microcalyx, commonly known as ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The plant spreads rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that can suppress other vegetation. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their mild antiseptic properties. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often considered a weed in lawns and gardens."
