    "intro": "Galinsoga eligulata, commonly known as common beggarlice, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive nature in many regions. Galinsoga eligulata is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, where it can quickly colonize open areas."
