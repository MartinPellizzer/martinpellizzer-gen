It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky or sandy habitats, often in mountainous regions. Its bulbs are underground and serve as storage organs, allowing the plant to survive in harsh environmental conditions. Gagea micrantha is an important species in its native ecosystems, contributing to local biodiversity and supporting pollinators."
