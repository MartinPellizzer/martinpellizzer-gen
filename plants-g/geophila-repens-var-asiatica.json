    "intro": "Geophila repens var. asiatica, commonly known as the Asiatic prostrate wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals. It thrives in woodland or streamside habitats, preferring cool, humid conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens for its delicate appearance."
