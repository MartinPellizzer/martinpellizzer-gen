    "intro": "Gongora tricolor, commonly known as the three-colored orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its strikingly colorful flowers with three distinct hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are elongated and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Gongora tricolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
