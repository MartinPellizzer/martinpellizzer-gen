    "intro": "Garciadelia castilloae, commonly known as the Castilloa garciadelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are simple and ovate, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
