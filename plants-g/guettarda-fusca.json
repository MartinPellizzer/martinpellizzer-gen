    "intro": "Guettarda fusca, commonly known as the evergreen shrub or coastal guettarda, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy soils due to its salt tolerance. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a glossy appearance, which helps reduce water loss. Guettarda fusca is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
