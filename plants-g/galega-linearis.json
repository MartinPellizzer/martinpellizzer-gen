    "intro": "Galega linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Galega linearis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
