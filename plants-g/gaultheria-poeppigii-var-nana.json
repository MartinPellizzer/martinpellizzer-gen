    "intro": "Gaultheria poeppigii var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It features dense clusters of small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, peppery flavor, making them popular in local cuisines. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and fragrance."
