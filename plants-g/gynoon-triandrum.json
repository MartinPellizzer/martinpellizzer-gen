    "intro": "Gynoon triandrum, commonly known as the three-angled orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique tri-lobed leaves and intricate floral structure. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are typically pale green or yellow with a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Gynoon triandrum is considered a species of conservation concern."
