    "intro": "Grammitis melete, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, dark green fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant's rhizomes are short and often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help it anchor to tree trunks or rocks in its natural habitat. Grammitis melete thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, ovate-shaped sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
