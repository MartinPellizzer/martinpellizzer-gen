    "intro": "Gastrolobium emarginatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often spindly growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. The species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant in dry conditions."
