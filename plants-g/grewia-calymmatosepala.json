    "intro": "Grewia calymmatosepala, commonly known as the velvetleaf grewia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, round berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and seasonal flowering."
