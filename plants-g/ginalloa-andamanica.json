    "intro": "Ginalloa andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman island orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, and it produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ginalloa andamanica is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
