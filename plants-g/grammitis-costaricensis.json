    "intro": "Grammitis costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican chain fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that often form dense clusters on tree trunks or branches. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique, linear pattern along the margins of the fronds. Grammitis costaricensis plays a vital role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to the biodiversity of forest canopies."
