    "intro": "Geranium latilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are palmately lobed with a distinctive broad shape. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. Its ornamental value and adaptability contribute to its use in both native plant landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
