    "intro": "Gentianella tarahumarae, commonly known as the Tarahumara gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually blue or violet, with five petals and prominent blue veins, and bloom during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
