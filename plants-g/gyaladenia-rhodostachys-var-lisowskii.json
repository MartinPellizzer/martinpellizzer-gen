    "intro": "Gyaladenia rhodostachys var. lisowskii, commonly known as the Lisowski's red-stemmed bellflower, is a rare and striking member of the Campanulaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its slender stems. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
