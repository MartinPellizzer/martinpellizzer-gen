    "intro": "Galedragon pilosus, commonly known as the hairy galedragon, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its fern-like leaves and umbellate flowers. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. It features a tall, slender stem covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale yellow, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Galedragon pilosus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
