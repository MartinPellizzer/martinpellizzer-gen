It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bright yellow to orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it an attractive and low-maintenance addition to native plant gardens."
