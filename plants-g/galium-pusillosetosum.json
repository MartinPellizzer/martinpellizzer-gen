    "intro": "Galium pusillosetosum, commonly known as the small-hairy bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 20 centimeters and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are usually arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences called scorpioid cymes. Galium pusillosetosum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
