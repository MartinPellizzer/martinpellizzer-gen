    "intro": "Gymnocalycium ochoterenae subsp. vatteri, commonly known as the Vatter's moon cactus, is a compact cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with a single, globular, pale green to blue-green body. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
