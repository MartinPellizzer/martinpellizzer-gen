    "intro": "Grewia mallococca, commonly known as the red gum tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and oval-shaped, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Grewia mallococca is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
