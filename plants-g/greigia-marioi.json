    "intro": "Greigia marioi, commonly known as the Mario's greigia, is a rare and unique species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are palmate, with five to seven lobes, and the flowers are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Greigia marioi is considered a species of conservation concern."
