    "intro": "Gossypium maritimum, commonly known as sea cotton, is a species of flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its soft, fluffy fibers that are harvested from its seed pods, which are typically green when mature. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small white or pale pink flowers. Due to its unique habitat and fiber properties, Gossypium maritimum has historical and ecological significance in coastal ecosystems."
