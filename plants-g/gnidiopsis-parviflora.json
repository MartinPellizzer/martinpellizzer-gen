It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in spring, and the plant is often found in coastal and inland regions.
