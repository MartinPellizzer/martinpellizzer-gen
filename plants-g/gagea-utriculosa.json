    "intro": "Gagea utriculosa, commonly known as the bladderleaf gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered bulbs and grass-like foliage. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a greenish tinge. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant in rock gardens or woodland settings. Gagea utriculosa is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for early pollinators in its native habitat."
