    "intro": "Galeopsis \u00d7 cousturieri, commonly known as the hybrid milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Galeopsis tetrahit and Galeopsis speciosa, characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in whorled clusters along the stem. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
