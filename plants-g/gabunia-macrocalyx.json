    "intro": "Gabunia macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-fruited gabunia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. These berries are edible and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Gabunia macrocalyx is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along riverbanks."
