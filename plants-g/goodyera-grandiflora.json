It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and striking, showy greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant itself is primarily valued for its ornamental beauty."
