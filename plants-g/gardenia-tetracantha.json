    "intro": "Gardenia tetracantha, commonly known as the four-angled gardenia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often four-angled in cross-section. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers with yellow stamens, which bloom in the summer months. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats."
