    "intro": "Grammitis angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf grammitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Grammitis angustata is a low-growing epiphytic or terrestrial fern, commonly occurring in forest understories."
