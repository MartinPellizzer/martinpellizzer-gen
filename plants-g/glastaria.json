    "intro": "Glastaria, commonly known as the common glasswort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, often salt-tolerant leaves and stems, which help it thrive in coastal and saline environments. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy areas or along the shores of lakes and oceans. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or red, and it produces small, three-angled fruits. Glastaria species are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
