    "intro": "Gaultheria willisiana, commonly known as the Sierra Madre wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub that produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Gaultheria willisiana has aromatic leaves that release a minty scent when crushed, and it is also known for its edible, red berries that ripen in late summer. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
