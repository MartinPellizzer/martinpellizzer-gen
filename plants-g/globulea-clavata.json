    "intro": "Globulea clavata, commonly known as the clustered globular plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, spherical fruits that resemble tiny globes, hence its scientific name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are usually pale pink or white. Globulea clavata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
