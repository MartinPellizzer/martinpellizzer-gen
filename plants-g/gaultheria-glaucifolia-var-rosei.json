    "intro": "Gaultheria glaucifolia var. rosei, commonly known as the roseleaf waxmyrtle, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a waxy, bluish-white coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
