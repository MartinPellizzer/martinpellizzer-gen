    "intro": "Glechoma depauperata, commonly known as lesser ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Glechoma depauperata is known for its creeping growth habit and ability to spread via stolons, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
