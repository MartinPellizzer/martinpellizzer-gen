    "intro": "Geranium aconitifolium var. album, commonly known as the white-flowered bell geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage that resembles the shape of a bell. The plant produces clusters of showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a slightly lobed appearance, often with a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, bell-like blooms."
