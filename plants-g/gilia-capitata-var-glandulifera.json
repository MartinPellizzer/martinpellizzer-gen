    "intro": "Gilia capitata var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with glandular hairs, which secrete oils that may deter herbivores. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
