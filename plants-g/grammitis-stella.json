    "intro": "Grammitis stella, commonly known as star grammitis, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other surfaces without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually small, lance-shaped, and have a finely divided structure. Grammitis stella thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
