    "intro": "Gorteria acaulis, commonly known as the cushion daisy, is a small, flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that form a compact cushion-like structure. The plant produces numerous daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a container plant."
