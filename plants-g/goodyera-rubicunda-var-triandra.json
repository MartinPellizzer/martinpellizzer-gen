    "intro": "Goodyera rubicunda var. triandra, commonly known as the red-veined twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
