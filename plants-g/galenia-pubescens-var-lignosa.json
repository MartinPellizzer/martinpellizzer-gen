It features a sprawling growth habit with woody stems that become more pronounced with age, giving it the 'lignosa' variety name. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas."
