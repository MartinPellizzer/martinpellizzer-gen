    "intro": "Gongreos filipes, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
