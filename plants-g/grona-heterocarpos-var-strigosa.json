    "intro": "Grona heterocarpos var. strigosa, commonly known as the hairy-fruited grona, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, where it thrives in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale green to brown ray florets. It produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. This variant is notable for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions and its role in local ecosystems."
