    "intro": "Geissaspis descampsii, commonly known as the Descamps' rock orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant prefers rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
