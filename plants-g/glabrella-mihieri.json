    "intro": "Glabrella mihieri, commonly known as the Mihieri's glabrella, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the island's unique ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
