    "intro": "Goodyera seikoomontana, commonly known as the mountain lady's tears, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
