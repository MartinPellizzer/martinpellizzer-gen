    "intro": "Geranium loloense, commonly known as the Lolo geranium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically has finely toothed, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy beneath. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine settings. Geranium loloense is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
