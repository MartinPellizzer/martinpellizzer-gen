    "intro": "Gaylussacia reticulata var. reticulata, commonly known as the red chokeberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and clusters of small, dark red berries that are edible for birds and humans. The plant produces white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by the development of its characteristic red fruits in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated edge, turning vibrant red or orange in the fall. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in herbal medicine for its antioxidant properties."
