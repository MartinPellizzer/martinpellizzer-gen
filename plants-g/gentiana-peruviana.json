    "intro": "Gentiana peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian gentian, is a striking perennial plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of down, which helps to retain moisture. Gentiana peruviana is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its traditional use in herbal medicine."
