    "intro": "Geniostemon schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's geniostemon, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth, and prefers well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
