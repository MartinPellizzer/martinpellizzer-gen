    "intro": "Glyceria expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by wind. Glyceria expansa thrives in saturated soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Its presence is an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
