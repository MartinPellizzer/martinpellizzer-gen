    "intro": "Gaultheria pumila var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf waxmyrtle, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its compact form and evergreen foliage make it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded, moist environments. The plant is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
