    "intro": "Geissanthus mezianus, commonly known as the Mezianus gooseberry, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in moist, shaded habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible berries that are often consumed by local wildlife. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a smooth texture and a slightly serrated edge. Geissanthus mezianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting biodiversity in its native ecosystem."
