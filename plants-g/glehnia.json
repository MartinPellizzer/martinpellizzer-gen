    "intro": "Glehnia, commonly known as the silverleaf glen, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. The plants are characterized by their evergreen shrubs with leathery, silver-gray leaves that reflect sunlight. They produce small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring. Glehnias are adapted to grow in acidic, well-drained soils and are often found in high-altitude environments."
