    "intro": "Geunsia hexandra var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf geunsia, is a variant of the geunsia species characterized by its notably larger leaves compared to the typical form. It is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface, and its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, often with a subtle fragrance. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity. The species is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for tropical and subtropical landscapes."
