    "intro": "Giadotrum malaccense, commonly known as the Malacca ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence that bears delicate, pale green or white flowers with a distinctive, ghost-like appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, rather than soil. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
