    "intro": "Guarea hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy guarea, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rough, hairy bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. Guarea hirsuta is often found in humid lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
