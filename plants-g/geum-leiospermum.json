    "intro": "Geum leiospermum, commonly known as the showy geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems covered in soft, velvety hairs, and its most striking characteristic is its clusters of showy, pink to red flowers. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy habitats. Geum leiospermum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
