    "intro": "Glyceria fluitans var. stricta, commonly known as the rigid floating grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters, often floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or damp soils, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life makes it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems."
