    "intro": "Glechoma hederacea variegata, commonly known as Variegated Ground Ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that often display striking variegation of green, white, and sometimes yellow. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers in the spring, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of streams. Due to its rapid growth and spreading habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
