    "intro": "Galeopsis reuteri, commonly known as the lesser hedge-nettle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and features opposite, hairy leaves that are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Galeopsis reuteri is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
