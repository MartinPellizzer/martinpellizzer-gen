    "intro": "Gonocitrus angulatus, commonly known as the angular citron, is a unique citrus species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive angular, ridged fruit shape and a thick, aromatic rind. The plant has small, dark green leaves with a leathery texture and produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is typically small, with a sour taste and high acidity, making it less suitable for commercial cultivation. The botanical features of Gonocitrus angulatus make it an interesting subject for taxonomic and horticultural study."
