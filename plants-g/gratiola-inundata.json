    "intro": "Gratiola inundata, commonly known as the water gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in aquatic environments. Gratiola inundata is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
