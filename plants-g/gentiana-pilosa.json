    "intro": "Gentiana pilosa, commonly known as the blue gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stem is usually unbranched and somewhat woody at the base. Gentiana pilosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
