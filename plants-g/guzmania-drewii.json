    "intro": "Guzmania drewii, commonly known as the red-tipped guzmania, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that often features red or orange bracts. The plant has a rosette-shaped leaf structure that collects water, creating a micro-ecosystem for small organisms. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Guzmania drewii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush appearance."
