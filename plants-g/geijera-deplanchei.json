It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glaucous in appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It is typically found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Geijera deplanchei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
