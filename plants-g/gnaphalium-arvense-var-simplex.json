    "intro": "Gnaphalium arvense var. simplex, commonly known as field cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming from June to September. The plant has slender, branched stems and hairy leaves that are usually alternate and lanceolate in shape. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its aromatic leaves and flowers release a fine, powdery substance when disturbed, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Gnaphalium."
