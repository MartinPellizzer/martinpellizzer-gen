    "intro": "Gypsophila perfoliata var. ilerdensis, commonly known as the Turkish baby's breath, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like foliage and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and prefers well-drained soil in full sun. Its unique feature is the way its stems pass through the leaves, creating a perfoliate arrangement, which is a distinguishing botanical trait. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and floral arrangements."
