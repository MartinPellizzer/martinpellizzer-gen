It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and dry open forests. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy upper surface. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and are arranged in clusters, often appearing in spring. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its ecological role in local habitats."
