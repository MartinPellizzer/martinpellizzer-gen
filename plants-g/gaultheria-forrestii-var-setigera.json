    "intro": "Gaultheria forrestii var. setigera, commonly known as the Sierra Madre wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
