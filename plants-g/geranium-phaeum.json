    "intro": "Geranium phaeum, commonly known as the purple geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to western and southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with slender stems and opposite leaves that are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Geranium phaeum prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
