It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. This species is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
