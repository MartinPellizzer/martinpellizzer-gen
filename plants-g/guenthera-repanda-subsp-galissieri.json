    "intro": "Guenthera repanda subsp. galissieri, commonly known as the Galissier's guenthera, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance, while its small, white flowers bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
