    "intro": "Gentiana trichotoma subsp. chingii, commonly known as the Ching's gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually opposite, with a hairy texture that gives it its specific epithet \"trichotoma.\" The subspecies chingii is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flower structure compared to the typical form of G. trichotoma."
