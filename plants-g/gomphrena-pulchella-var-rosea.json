    "intro": "Gomphrena pulchella var. rosea, commonly known as the rosea bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its striking, pink to rose-colored bracts that resemble small, rounded leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often mistaken for foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The botanical features of this variety make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in native plant landscapes."
