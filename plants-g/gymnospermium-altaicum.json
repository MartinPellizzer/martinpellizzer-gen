    "intro": "Gymnospermium altaicum, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the gymnosperm group, characterized by its ability to produce naked seeds rather than enclosed fruits. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in clusters, and it produces cones that contain the seeds. Gymnospermium altaicum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude environments. Its wood is durable and has been historically used for construction and fuel."
