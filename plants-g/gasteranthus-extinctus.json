    "intro": "Gasteranthus extinctus, commonly known as the extinct urn flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, urn-shaped flowers that are typically brightly colored, often in shades of red or orange. The plant is native to the Andean regions of South America, where it thrived in humid, shaded environments. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Gasteranthus extinctus is believed to be extinct in the wild. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for conservationists and botanists alike."
