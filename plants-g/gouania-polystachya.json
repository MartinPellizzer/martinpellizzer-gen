    "intro": "Gouania polystachya, commonly known as the hairy gouania, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Gouania polystachya is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
