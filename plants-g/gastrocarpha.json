    "intro": "Gastrocarpha, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for trapping tiny aquatic organisms. Gastrocarpha species are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. They are often submerged or floating, with slender stems and small, scale-like leaves. The genus is known for its unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition through predation."
