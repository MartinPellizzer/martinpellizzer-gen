    "intro": "Geboscon latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf geboscon, is a striking perennial plant native to the temperate regions of southern Europe. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the late spring to early summer. Its growth habit is upright, with a tendency to form dense clumps, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. The plant is relatively low maintenance, thriving in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight."
