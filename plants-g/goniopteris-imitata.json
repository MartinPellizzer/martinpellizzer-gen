    "intro": "Goniopteris imitata, commonly known as the mimic fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that resemble those of other fern genera, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Goniopteris imitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
