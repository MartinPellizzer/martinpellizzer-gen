    "intro": "Grammitis calolepis, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it attaches itself to tree trunks or branches. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and produce spores for propagation. Grammitis calolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
