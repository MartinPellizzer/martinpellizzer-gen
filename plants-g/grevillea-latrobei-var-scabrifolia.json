It is characterized by its narrow, rough, and often hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
