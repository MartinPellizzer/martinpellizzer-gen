    "intro": "Grusonia prolifera, commonly known as the creeping grusonia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with numerous stolons that root at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. Grusonia prolifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
