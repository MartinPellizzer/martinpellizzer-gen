    "intro": "Gentianella muelleriana subsp. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils. The plant features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with a fine pubescence, aiding in water retention. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
