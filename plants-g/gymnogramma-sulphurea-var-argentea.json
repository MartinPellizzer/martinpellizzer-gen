    "intro": "Gymnogramma sulphurea var. argentea, commonly known as the silver-stemmed iron plant, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a fine, silvery or whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value comes from its striking silver appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
