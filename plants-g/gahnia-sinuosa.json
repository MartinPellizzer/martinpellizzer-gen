    "intro": "Gahnia sinuosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial tussock-forming grass native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that produce dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are often adorned with pale to brownish flowers. Gahnia sinuosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
