    "intro": "Gentiana plicata, commonly known as the creased gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a waxy surface, which helps retain moisture. Gentiana plicata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
