    "intro": "Gesneria viridiflora var. obovata, commonly known as the Obovate Gesneria, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and broad, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
