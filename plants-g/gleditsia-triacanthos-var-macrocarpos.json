    "intro": "Gleditsia triacanthos var. macrocarpos, commonly known as the honey locust, is a deciduous legume native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into 10 to 20 pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing edible, sweet seeds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental tree or shrub due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The honey locust also has a deep root system that makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control."
