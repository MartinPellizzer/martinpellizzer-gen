    "intro": "Glochidion versicolor, commonly known as the variable glabrous wood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the name \"glabrous\" suggests a smooth texture. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is often found in lowland rainforests. Glochidion versicolor is noted for its adaptability to various soil types and its role in local ecosystems."
