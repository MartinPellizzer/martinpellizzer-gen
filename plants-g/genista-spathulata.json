It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is characterized by its slender, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often with a slightly hairy texture. Genista spathulata is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates."
