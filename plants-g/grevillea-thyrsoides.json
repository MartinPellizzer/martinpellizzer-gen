    "intro": "Grevillea thyrsoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waratah, is a striking evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that bear showy, red or orange flowers, which are highly attractive to birds and nectar-feeding insects. The plant features narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Grevillea thyrsoides is also valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand coastal conditions."
