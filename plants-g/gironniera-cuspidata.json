    "intro": "Gironniera cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and structural strength, it is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
