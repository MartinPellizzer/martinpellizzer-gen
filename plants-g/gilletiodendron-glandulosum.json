It is characterized by its smooth, often grayish bark and elliptical leaves that are usually clustered at the base of the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local communities."
