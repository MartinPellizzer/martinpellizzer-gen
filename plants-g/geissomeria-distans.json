    "intro": "Geissomeria distans, commonly known as the distant gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value. Geissomeria distans thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens."
