    "intro": "Gilia pluriflora, commonly known as the many-flowered gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that are usually pink, purple, or white, blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. Gilia pluriflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
