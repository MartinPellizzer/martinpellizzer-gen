    "intro": "Galeopsis pyrenaica var. nana, commonly known as the Pyrenean hedge nettle, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with hairy, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
