    "intro": "Gastrolobium pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered wattle, is a small shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which appear in late winter to early spring, and its compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. It is part of the Fabaceae family, which includes many legumes, and it plays a role in soil stabilization due to its deep root system. However, it is considered toxic to livestock, as it contains various alkaloids that can be harmful if ingested."
