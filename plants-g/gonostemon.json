    "intro": "Gonostemon, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Gonostemon corymbosus, which is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. They are often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and riverbanks. Gonostemon species are sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
