    "intro": "Goodyera hylophiloides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly veils. The plant produces striking, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and specific soil conditions. Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, it is often protected and difficult to cultivate outside its natural habitat."
