    "intro": "Gongora vitorinoana, commonly known as the Vitorino's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb and produces showy, fragrant blooms during the dry season. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened, highlighting the need for its protection."
