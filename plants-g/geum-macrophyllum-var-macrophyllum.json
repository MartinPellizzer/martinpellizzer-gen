    "intro": "Geum macrophyllum var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant marsh cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its showy, bright yellow flowers bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist soils along stream banks, marshes, and wet meadows. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a popular choice for native plant gardens."
