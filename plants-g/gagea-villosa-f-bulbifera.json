    "intro": "Gagea villosa f. bulbifera, commonly known as the hairy gagea with bulbils, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers in early spring, followed by the development of bulbils on the flower stalks. These bulbils are vegetative propagules that can grow into new plants, aiding in its reproduction and spread. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows."
