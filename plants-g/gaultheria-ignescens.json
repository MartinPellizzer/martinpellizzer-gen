    "intro": "Gaultheria ignescens, commonly known as the firebush, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Gaultheria ignescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate partial shade."
