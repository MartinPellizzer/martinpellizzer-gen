    "intro": "Gnaphalium piluliferum, commonly known as the globe willow or goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, giving it its common name. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The leaves are typically small, hairy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to reduce water loss."
