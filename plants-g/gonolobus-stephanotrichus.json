    "intro": "Gonolobus stephanotrichus, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and blue. The plant is typically found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae, which includes many vines and climbing plants. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions."
