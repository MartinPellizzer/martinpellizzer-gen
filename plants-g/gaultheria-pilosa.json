    "intro": "Gaultheria pilosa, commonly known as the hairy wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, aromatic flavor. Gaultheria pilosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also valued for its medicinal properties."
