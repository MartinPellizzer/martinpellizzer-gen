    "intro": "Glossorhyncha pteropetala, commonly known as the winged-leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble wings, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
