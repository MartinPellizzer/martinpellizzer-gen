    "intro": "Gastrodia siamensis, commonly known as the Siam arrowroot, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that grows in dense, shaded forest undergrowth, typically in humid and cool environments. The plant is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a fleshy, tuberous root system and a single, upright stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, often clustered in a spike, and it produces a distinctive, aromatic scent. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Gastrodia siamensis is critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
