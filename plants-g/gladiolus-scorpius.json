    "intro": "Gladiolus scorpius, commonly known as the snake's head or scorpion grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves and tall, erect stems that bear clusters of vibrant, spathaceous flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing showy, often red or orange, flower spikes that attract pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Despite its ornamental appeal, it can be invasive in some regions and is sometimes considered a weed."
