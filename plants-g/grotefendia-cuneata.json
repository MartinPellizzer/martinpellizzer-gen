It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish flowers. The plant has a slender, branching stem and small, scale-like leaves. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants."
