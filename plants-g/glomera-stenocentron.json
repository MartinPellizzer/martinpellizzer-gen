    "intro": "Glomera stenocentron, commonly known as the narrow-centered glomerula, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered umbels of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed, a common trait in the Apiaceae family. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
