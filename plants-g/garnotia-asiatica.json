    "intro": "Garnotia asiatica, commonly known as the Asian garnet vine, is a climbing plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor to supports. Garnotia asiatica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
