    "intro": "Galium obstipum f. latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf bedstraw, is a variant of the bedstraw plant characterized by its broader leaves compared to the typical form. It is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant produces small white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The species is noted for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
