    "intro": "Grewia bojeri, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red gum, is a small shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy habitats. Grewia bojeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
