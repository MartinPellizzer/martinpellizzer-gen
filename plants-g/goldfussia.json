It features showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has thick, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical name, *Tropaeolum majus*, reflects its historical use in traditional medicine."
