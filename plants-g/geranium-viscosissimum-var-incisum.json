It features upright stems covered in a sticky, glandular coating, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically lobed or deeply divided, with a hairy texture. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
