    "intro": "Gnaphalium proximum, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, often hairy stems and small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. Its flowers are yellowish to pale pink, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Gnaphalium proximum is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
