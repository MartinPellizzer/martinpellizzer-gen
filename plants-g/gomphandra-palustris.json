    "intro": "Gomphandra palustris, commonly known as the marsh gomphandra, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It typically grows in marshy or swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters near the base of the plant. Gomphandra palustris plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
