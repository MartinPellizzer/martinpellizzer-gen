    "intro": "Gronophyllum oxypetalum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. The leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss and enhance its survival in dry conditions."
