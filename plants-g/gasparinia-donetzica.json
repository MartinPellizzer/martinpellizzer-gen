    "intro": "Gasparinia donetzica, commonly known as the Donetz grass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with distinct seasonal changes. Gasparinia donetzica is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides."
