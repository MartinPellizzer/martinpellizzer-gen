It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of the genus Achillea, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value."
