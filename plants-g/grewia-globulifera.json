    "intro": "Grewia globulifera, commonly known as the globe thorn-apple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its small, globe-shaped yellow fruits that are clustered in umbels, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate with a rough texture. It produces small white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
