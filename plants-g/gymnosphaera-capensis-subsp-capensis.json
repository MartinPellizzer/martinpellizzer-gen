    "intro": "Gymnosphaera capensis subsp. capensis, commonly known as the Cape cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base of the trunk and female cones emerging from the upper part. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, dry climate. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable and vulnerable species in its native habitat."
