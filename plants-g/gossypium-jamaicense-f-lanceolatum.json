    "intro": "Gossypium jamaicense f. lanceolatum, commonly known as the Jamaican cotton or lanceolate cotton, is a variant of the cotton genus native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its lanceolate-shaped leaves and hairy, fluffy bolls that contain the fibrous material used for textile production. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils. It is a diploid species with a genome size that is relatively small compared to other cotton varieties. Due to its limited geographic distribution, it is considered a rare and less commercially cultivated cotton species."
