    "intro": "Gagea soleirolii var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra gagea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, bulbous base and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pinkish flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
