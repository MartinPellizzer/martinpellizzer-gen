    "intro": "Gomphrena diffusa subsp. arenicola, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that produces dense clusters of pink or red, spiky flowers. The plant is adapted to sandy and well-drained soils, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
