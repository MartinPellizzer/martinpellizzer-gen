    "intro": "Gaultheria mucronata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It features dense clusters of small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. These fruits are edible and have a spicy, peppery flavor, often used in culinary applications. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories."
