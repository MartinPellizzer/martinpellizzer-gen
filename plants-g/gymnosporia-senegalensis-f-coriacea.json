    "intro": "Gymnosporia senegalensis f. coriacea, commonly known as the rough gymnosporia, is a shrub native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces cone-like structures containing its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and have a rough texture, contributing to its common name. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions."
