    "intro": "Goniopteris clypeata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust, trunk-like stem covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rhizome. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive arrangement of pinnae and pinnules. Goniopteris clypeata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
