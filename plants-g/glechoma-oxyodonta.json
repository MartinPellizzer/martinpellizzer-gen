    "intro": "Glechoma oxyodonta, commonly known as the creeping ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and small, fragrant blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant spreads rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that can suppress other vegetation. Its leaves are often used in herbal medicine for their mild sedative and antiseptic properties. Glechoma oxyodonta thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
