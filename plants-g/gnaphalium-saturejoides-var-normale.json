    "intro": "Gnaphalium saturejoides var. normale, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of slender, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces numerous tiny, white to pale yellow flower heads that are often surrounded by pale green bracts. It thrives in moist, often calcareous soils and is commonly found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it an important plant for pollinators and a characteristic component of certain grassland ecosystems."
