    "intro": "Galium sylvestre var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy wood-sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, ascending stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly glossy surface and clusters of white, five-petaled flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive member of the Rubiaceae family."
