    "intro": "Genista caballeroi, commonly known as the Mexican broom, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Genista caballeroi is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
