It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, delicate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clustered, lanceolate leaves. The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
