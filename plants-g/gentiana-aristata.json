    "intro": "Gentiana aristata, commonly known as the Alpine gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stem is usually unbranched and rises to bear the flowers. Gentiana aristata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
