    "intro": "Guatteria chocoensis, commonly known as the Chocoan guatteria, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the humid lowland forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Marcaceae, which includes willows and related plants, though it is more closely related to the genus *Guatteria* within the family Annonaceae. The plant features opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. The fruit is a fleshy, yellow or orange berry that contains several seeds, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for various wildlife species."
