    "intro": "Goodyera sphingoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted to capture moisture from the air. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on the trunks of hardwood trees. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
