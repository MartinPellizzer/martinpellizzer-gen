    "intro": "Grewia lateriflora, commonly known as the white-flowered bushwillow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It features slender, often branched stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in summer, followed by orange to red berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for cultivation in arid and semi-arid regions. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in local habitats."
