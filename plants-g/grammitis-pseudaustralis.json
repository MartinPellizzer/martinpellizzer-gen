It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered closely together. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture. Grammitis pseudaustralis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter for small organisms."
