    "intro": "Gambeya lacourtiana, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, dark bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, leathery fruits containing one or two seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Gambeya lacourtiana also plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
