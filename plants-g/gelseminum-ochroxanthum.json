    "intro": "Gelseminum ochroxanthum, commonly known as the yellow bell vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are often covered in fine, pubescent hairs. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist forest understories. The flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure."
