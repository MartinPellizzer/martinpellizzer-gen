    "intro": "Gaultheria glandulosissima, commonly known as the sticky leaved wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving them a sticky texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Gaultheria glandulosissima is valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
