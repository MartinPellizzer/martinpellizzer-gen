    "intro": "Geniostoma erythrospermum, commonly known as the red-seeded daisy, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, red, spherical seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in arid and semi-arid regions. It typically grows as a low shrub with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Geniostoma erythrospermum is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy soils."
