    "intro": "Gnaphalium japonicum var. collinum, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a perennial herb native to Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are linear, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats."
