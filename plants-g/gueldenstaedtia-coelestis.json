    "intro": "Gueldenstaedtia coelestis, commonly known as the celestial vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods that mature in the fall, dispersing through wind and animals. Native to Central Asia, it thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in steppes and mountainous regions."
