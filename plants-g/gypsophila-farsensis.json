It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in harsh climates.
