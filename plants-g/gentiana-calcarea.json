    "intro": "Gentiana calcarea, commonly known as the limestone gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in calcareous soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers during the summer months. Its flowers are typically trumpet-shaped with five petals and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. Gentiana calcarea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties."
