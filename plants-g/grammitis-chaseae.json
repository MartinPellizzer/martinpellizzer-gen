It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like foliage. The plant has slender, wiry stems that bear spirally arranged leaves, which are typically less than an inch in length. Grammitis chaseae thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky outcrops and forest floors. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
