    "intro": "Gymnolomia decurrens, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or pale violet bloom, and its stems often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics include alternate leaves and a fibrous root system, which contribute to its ability to thrive in wet soil conditions. Gymnolomia decurrens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
