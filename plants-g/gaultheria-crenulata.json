    "intro": "Gaultheria crenulata, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces bright red, edible berries that are highly sought after for their sweet, tangy flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests and alpine meadows. Gaultheria crenulata is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its culinary and medicinal uses."
