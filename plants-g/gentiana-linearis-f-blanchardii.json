    "intro": "Gentiana linearis f. blanchardii, commonly known as the Blanchard's gentian, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and vibrant blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The species belongs to the Gentianaceae family, known for its showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
