    "intro": "Gymnocalycium striglianum, commonly known as the Strigliana cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern South America. It is a low-growing, solitary cactus with a short, thick stem that often remains below ground. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its spines are typically short and dense, providing protection from herbivores. Gymnocalycium striglianum is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, storing water in its fleshy stem."
