    "intro": "Grammitis myosuroides, commonly known as the mouse-tail fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees or rocks, forming dense, mat-like clusters. The plant has slender, wiry fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety layer of hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are surrounded by a protective indusium. Grammitis myosuroides prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks."
