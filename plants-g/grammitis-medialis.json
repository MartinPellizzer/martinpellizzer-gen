    "intro": "Grammitis medialis, commonly known as the common grammitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky surfaces or tree trunks. Grammitis medialis plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
