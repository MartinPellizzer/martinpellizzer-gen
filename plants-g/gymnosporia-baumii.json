    "intro": "Gymnosporia baumii, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its spiny stems and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain a single seed, which is encased in a hard, fibrous coat. Gymnosporia baumii is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
