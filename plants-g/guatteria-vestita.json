It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded understories of forests. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent white veins, and it produces small, clustered flowers with white petals. Its fruits are fleshy berries that are often consumed by various bird species.
