    "intro": "Galactites tomentosus var. albiflorus, commonly known as the whiteflower milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can withstand drought conditions. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to prevent soil erosion."
