    "intro": "Galium divaricatum var. tenuicaule, commonly known as slender wood-socket, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its wetland or semi-aquatic habitat."
