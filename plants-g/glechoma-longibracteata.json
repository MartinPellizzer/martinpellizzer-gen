    "intro": "Glechoma longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The leaves are heart-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture, and the plant produces small, blue-violet flowers in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The species is noted for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
