    "intro": "Geranium terebinthinaceum, commonly known as the Persian geranium, is a perennial herb native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It features upright stems covered in fine hairs and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals. The plant has serrated, lobed leaves that are often aromatic when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period and drought tolerance."
