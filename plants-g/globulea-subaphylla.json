It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered fronds that resemble small globes. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in dense, rounded formations on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
