    "intro": "Garrya, commonly known as the silverleaf buckthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Elaeagnaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. The plants are characterized by their silvery foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, scale-like hairs. Garrya species typically have small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters, followed by small, edible berries. These plants are often found in dry, rocky soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
