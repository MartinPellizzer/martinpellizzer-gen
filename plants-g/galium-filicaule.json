    "intro": "Galium filicaule, commonly known as creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with five petals and a spurred shape, blooming in early summer. Galium filicaule thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
