    "intro": "Gastrodia confusa f. viridis, commonly known as the green-flowered gastrodia, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and distinctive greenish-yellow flowers that differ from the typical brownish hues of the species. The plant produces a fleshy, tuberous root system, which is often harvested for traditional medicinal purposes. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, typically found in dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
