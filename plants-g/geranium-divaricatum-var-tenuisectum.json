It features slender, branching stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are narrow, elongated, and finely divided, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
