    "intro": "Galeomma oculus-cati, commonly known as the cat's eye fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble the shape of a cat's eye, with a central vein and a series of smaller veins radiating outward. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, round structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Galeomma oculus-cati is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
