    "intro": "Gnaphalium selaginifolium, commonly known as silverleaf ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and woolly, silver-gray foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant produces numerous small, oval-shaped seeds. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
