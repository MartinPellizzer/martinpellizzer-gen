    "intro": "Garuga forrestii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark bark and small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Garuga forrestii is well adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species with a long lifespan. Its slow growth rate and durable wood make it valuable for traditional uses and ecological stability in its native habitats."
