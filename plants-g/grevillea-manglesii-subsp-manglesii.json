    "intro": "Grevillea manglesii subsp. manglesii, commonly known as the Mangles' grevillea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically grey-green in color, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces striking, feather-like inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy coastal plant. Grevillea manglesii subsp. manglesii is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience."
