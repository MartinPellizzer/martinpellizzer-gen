    "intro": "Galium viscosum var. hesperium, commonly known as sticky willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are often covered in a sticky, glandular resin. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in cymes, and its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. The sticky secretions on its stems and leaves serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and aid in water retention."
