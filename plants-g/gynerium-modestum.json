    "intro": "Gynerium modestum, commonly known as the common water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters. Gynerium modestum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
