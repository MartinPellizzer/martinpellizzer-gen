    "intro": "Gleichenia pallescens, commonly known as the pale Gleichenia, is a fern that belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and linear, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green to gray-green in color. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Gleichenia pallescens is an evergreen plant that can form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its natural habitat."
