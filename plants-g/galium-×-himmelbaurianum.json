    "intro": "Galium \u00d7 himmelbaurianum, commonly known as Himmelman's weed, is a hybrid plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and opposite leaves. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped with a hairy surface, and the plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in disturbed soils and gardens."
