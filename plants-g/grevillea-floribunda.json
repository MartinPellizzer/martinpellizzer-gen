    "intro": "Grevillea floribunda, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that appear in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid or coastal habitats. Grevillea floribunda is well-suited to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens."
