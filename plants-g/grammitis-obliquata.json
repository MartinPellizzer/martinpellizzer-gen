It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a zigzag pattern along their veins, which gives it its common name. Grammitis obliquata thrives in humid environments and is often found in shaded, moist forest areas."
