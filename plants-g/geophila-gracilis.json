    "intro": "Geophila gracilis, commonly known as slender wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Geophila gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
