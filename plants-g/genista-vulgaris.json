    "intro": "Genista vulgaris, commonly known as the common broom, is a perennial shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed or open habitats. Genista vulgaris is notable for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
