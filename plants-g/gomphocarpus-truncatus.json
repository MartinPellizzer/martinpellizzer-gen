    "intro": "Gomphocarpus truncatus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant contains toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation and is used in traditional medicine."
