    "intro": "Gagea chitralensis, commonly known as the Chitral gagea, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Liliaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the end of a flowering stem. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
