    "intro": "Gagea minima var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered gagea, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. The plant produces delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and can remain dormant during dry periods. This variety is distinguished by its notably white flowers, which set it apart from other varieties of Gagea."
