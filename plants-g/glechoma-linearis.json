    "intro": "Glechoma linearis, commonly known as narrowleaf ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It spreads primarily through stolons, forming dense mats that can colonize moist, shaded areas. Glechoma linearis is often found in woodland floors and along stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
