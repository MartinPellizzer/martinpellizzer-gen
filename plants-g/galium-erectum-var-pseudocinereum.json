    "intro": "Galium erectum var. pseudocinereum, commonly known as silverweed or white bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, often hairy stems that rise from a rhizomatous base, and its small, white to pale pink flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and usually covered with fine, silky hairs that give the plant a silvery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and is often found in disturbed soils. The plant is noted for its delicate beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
