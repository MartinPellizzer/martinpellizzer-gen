    "intro": "Gilia floccosa var. filifolia, commonly known as the silky gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, fluffy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, filamentous leaves that help reduce water loss. Its stems are slender and often branched, with small, scale-like leaves along the stem. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
