    "intro": "Grammitis subfalcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a lanceolate shape. The plant's rhizomes are wiry and often form dense clusters on tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests or rainforests. Grammitis subfalcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
