    "intro": "Gymnogramma brownii, commonly known as the Brown's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a glossy green color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are covered by a protective indusium. Gymnogramma brownii is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
