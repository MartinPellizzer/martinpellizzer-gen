    "intro": "Grammitis torulosa, commonly known as the coral fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The fronds are typically bright green, with a waxy surface and a distinctive, coral-like appearance due to their clustered, finger-like lobes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
