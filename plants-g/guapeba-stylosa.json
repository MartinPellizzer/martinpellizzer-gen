    "intro": "Guapeba stylosa, commonly known as the Brazilian wild orchid, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender stems and clustered, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical regions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
