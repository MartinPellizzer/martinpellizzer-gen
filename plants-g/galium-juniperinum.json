    "intro": "Galium juniperinum, commonly known as creeping woodruff, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. Galium juniperinum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
