    "intro": "Geonoma compacta, commonly known as the compact bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in a spike, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its leaves are typically short and thick, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Geonoma compacta is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its compact size and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
