It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of pale yellow to cream-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and meadows, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-brown seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. This variety is noted for its ecological significance, supporting a range of pollinators and contributing to biodiversity in its native range."
