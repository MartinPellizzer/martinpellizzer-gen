    "intro": "Guatteria inundata, commonly known as the flooded guatteria, is a species of flowering plant native to the wetlands and lowland forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels and avocado trees. The plant is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, often waterlogged habitat. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that may be an important food source for local wildlife."
