    "intro": "Gaultheria coccinea, commonly known as the red alpine cranberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are edible and have a tart, cranberry-like flavor. These berries are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Gaultheria coccinea thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions."
