    "intro": "Gossypium suffruticosum, commonly known as the wild cotton plant, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its woody stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces fluffy, white fibers similar to those of cultivated cotton, though it is not typically used for commercial textile production. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm climate with sufficient sunlight. Gossypium suffruticosum plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration and sustainable agriculture."
