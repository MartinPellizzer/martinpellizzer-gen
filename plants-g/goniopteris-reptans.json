    "intro": "Goniopteris reptans, commonly known as the creeping water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across moist ground. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. This plant thrives in shady, humid environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures include sori that are arranged in lines along the undersides of the fronds."
