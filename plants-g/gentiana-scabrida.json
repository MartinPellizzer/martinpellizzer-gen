    "intro": "Gentiana scabrida, commonly known as the rough gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and alpine meadows. Its leaves are rough to the touch, giving it its common name, and it has a compact, upright growth habit. Gentiana scabrida is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
