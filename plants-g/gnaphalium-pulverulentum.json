    "intro": "Gnaphalium pulverulentum, commonly known as the dustyhead or whitehead plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense heads, giving it a powdery appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, often in temperate regions. Its leaves are usually grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its dusty appearance. The species is known for producing a strong, aromatic scent, which can be both pleasant and deterrent to herbivores."
