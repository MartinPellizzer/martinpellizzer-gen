    "intro": "Gentiana nivalis f. reducta, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a rare and striking plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its vivid blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. Its reduced form, 'reducta,' refers to its smaller size and simplified floral structure compared to the typical species. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
