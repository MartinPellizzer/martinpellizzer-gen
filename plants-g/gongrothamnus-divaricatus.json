    "intro": "Gongrothamnus divaricatus, commonly known as the creeping snowberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain toxic compounds, making them unsuitable for human consumption. Gongrothamnus divaricatus thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
