    "intro": "Galium trifidum subsp. columbianum, commonly known as the Columbia bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to western North America. It features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite and trifid, meaning they are divided into three parts, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks."
