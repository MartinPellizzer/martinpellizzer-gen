    "intro": "Goniopteris incisa, commonly known as the narrow-lobed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Goniopteris incisa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
