    "intro": "Galium affine, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and usually covered with fine, silvery hairs. Galium affine thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
