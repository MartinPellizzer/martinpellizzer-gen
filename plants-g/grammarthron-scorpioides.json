    "intro": "Grammarthron scorpioides, commonly known as the scorpion-tongue plant, is a unique member of the Scrophulariaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that resemble the tail of a scorpion, hence its common name. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are typically purple or violet and are clustered in racemes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
