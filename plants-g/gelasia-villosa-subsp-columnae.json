    "intro": "Gelasia villosa subsp. columnae, commonly known as the woolly gelasia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered, often in loose inflorescences, and are typically greenish-white in color."
