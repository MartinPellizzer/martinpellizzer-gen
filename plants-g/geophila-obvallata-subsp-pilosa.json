    "intro": "Geophila obvallata subsp. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy leaf geophila, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The subspecies is distinguished by its more prominent pubescence compared to other members of the Geophila genus."
