    "intro": "Glycine angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods containing edible seeds that are rich in protein. Glycine angustifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its nutritional value. It also has potential uses in soil improvement due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
