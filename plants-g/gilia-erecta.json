It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Gilia erecta is often found in rocky areas and along streambanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
