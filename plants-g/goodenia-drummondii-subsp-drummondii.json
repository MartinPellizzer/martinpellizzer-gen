    "intro": "Goodenia drummondii subsp. drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's goodenia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a perennial herb with slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. This species is often found in open habitats such as gravelly plains and sandy soils."
