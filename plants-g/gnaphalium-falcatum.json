    "intro": "Gnaphalium falcatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant is known for its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Gnaphalium falcatum is also valued for its use in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting, dried appearance."
