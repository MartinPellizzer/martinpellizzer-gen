    "intro": "Glyceria depauperata var. depauperata, commonly known as the slender glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
