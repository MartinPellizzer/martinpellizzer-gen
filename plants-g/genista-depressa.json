    "intro": "Genista depressa, commonly known as the creeping genista, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, spiny stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in pairs along the stems. Genista depressa is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates."
