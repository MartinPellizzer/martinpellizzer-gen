    "intro": "Goodenia hederacea subsp. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine goodenia, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as heathlands and grassy slopes. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh conditions of its environment. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
