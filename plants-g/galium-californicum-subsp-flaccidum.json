    "intro": "Galium californicum subsp. flaccidum, commonly known as the softleaf bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to western North America. It features slender, often hairy stems that lie close to the ground, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology compared to other Galium species found in the region."
