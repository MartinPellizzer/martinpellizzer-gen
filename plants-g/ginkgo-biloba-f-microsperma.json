    "intro": "Ginkgo biloba f. microsperma, commonly known as the miniature ginkgo, is a cultivar characterized by its small, compact size and unique foliage. This variety exhibits smaller leaves compared to the standard ginkgo, with a more rounded shape and a distinct yellow-green coloration. It is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in urban landscapes due to its tolerance of pollution and compact growth habit. The tree produces small, spherical seeds, which are enclosed in a fleshy, odorous outer layer. It is a male-only cultivar, making it suitable for areas where female trees' seed production may be undesirable."
