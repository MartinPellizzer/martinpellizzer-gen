It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and bright orange to red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, woody fruits called follicles, which contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
