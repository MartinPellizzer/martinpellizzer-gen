    "intro": "Guatteria darienensis, commonly known as the Darien guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a drupe, typically containing a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, reddish pulp. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
