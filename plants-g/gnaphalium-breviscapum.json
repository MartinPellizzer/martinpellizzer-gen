    "intro": "Gnaphalium breviscapum, commonly known as the short-stemmed cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically features slender, hairy stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Due to its small size and delicate appearance, it is often overlooked but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
