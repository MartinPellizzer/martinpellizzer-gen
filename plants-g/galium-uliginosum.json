    "intro": "Galium uliginosum, commonly known as bog stitchwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that form dense mats, and its small, white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Galium uliginosum plays an important role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is a food source for various insects and small animals."
