    "intro": "Gaultheria brachyantha var. parvula, commonly known as the dwarf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense, dark green foliage with a glossy appearance and produces small, urn-shaped white flowers in the spring. The plant is noted for its aromatic leaves, which contain methyl salicylate, giving it a wintergreen scent. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. This variety is smaller than the typical Gaultheria brachyantha, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
