    "intro": "Gymnanthemum congestum, commonly known as the clustered star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers. The plant produces a fleshy, bulbous stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it typically blooms in late winter to early spring. Gymnanthemum congestum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to add a touch of elegance to rock gardens."
