    "intro": "Geum strictum, commonly known as the upright buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, slender stems that bear clusters of bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Geum strictum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
