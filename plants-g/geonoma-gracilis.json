    "intro": "Geonoma gracilis, commonly known as the slender geonoma, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often as an epiphyte on trees or rocks. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy surface, which helps retain moisture. The inflorescence is relatively simple, with small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by clustered berries."
