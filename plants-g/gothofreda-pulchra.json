    "intro": "Gothofreda pulchra, commonly known as the beautiful ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with translucent leaves and delicate, pale flowers that resemble spectral forms. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in the understory of tropical forests. Its botanical features include a short rhizome and a single, slender stem that bears a few flowers. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Gothofreda pulchra is considered a conservation concern."
