    "intro": "Georgina bipinnata, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of small leaflets. The plant produces showy, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in long, pendulous clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
