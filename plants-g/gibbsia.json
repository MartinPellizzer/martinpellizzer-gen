    "intro": "Gibbsia, commonly known as the false heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their evergreen leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. They are native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where they thrive in rocky and coastal environments. Gibbsia species are often found in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Their ornamental value has made them popular in horticulture, though they are not widely cultivated outside their native range."
