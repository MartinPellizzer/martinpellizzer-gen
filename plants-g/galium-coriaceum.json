    "intro": "Galium coriaceum, commonly known as rough bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are oval, hairy, and have a slightly waxy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. Galium coriaceum is often found in dry grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas."
