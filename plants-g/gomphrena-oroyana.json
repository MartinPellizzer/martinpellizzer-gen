    "intro": "Gomphrena oroyana, commonly known as the mountain gomphrena, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, feathery inflorescences that range in color from red to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Gomphrena oroyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
