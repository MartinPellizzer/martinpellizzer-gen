    "intro": "Goniothalamus dumontetii, commonly known as the Dumontet's talaud, is a member of the Annonaceae family and is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
