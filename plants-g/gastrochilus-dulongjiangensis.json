    "intro": "Gastrochilus dulongjiangensis, commonly known as the Dulong Jiang gastrochilus, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and vibrant coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers, which bloom during the spring season, are notable for their intricate petal arrangement and fragrant scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
