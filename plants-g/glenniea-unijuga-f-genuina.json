    "intro": "Glenniea unijuga f. genuina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved glenniea, is a rare and unique plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly curled, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
