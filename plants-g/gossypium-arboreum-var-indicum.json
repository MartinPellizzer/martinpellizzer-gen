    "intro": "Gossypium arboreum var. indicum, commonly known as the Indian cotton tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its lanceolate leaves and showy, pink to red flowers. The plant produces fluffy, white cotton-like fibers that are harvested from its bolls, though it is less commercially important than other cotton species. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm climate with sufficient sunlight. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native habitats."
