    "intro": "Gentiana nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is a perennial herb with lance-shaped leaves and a slender stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
