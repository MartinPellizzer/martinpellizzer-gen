    "intro": "Guettarda elliptica, commonly known as the Brazilian jasmine or the golden shower tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually leathery and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and continuous flowering habit. Guettarda elliptica is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
