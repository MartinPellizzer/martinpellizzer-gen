    "intro": "Gilia laciniata, commonly known as the fringed gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry slopes. Gilia laciniata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
