    "intro": "Grammitis subfasciata, commonly known as the banded maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often display a distinct banded pattern. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its leaves are usually dark green with a glossy texture, and the sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds. Grammitis subfasciata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
