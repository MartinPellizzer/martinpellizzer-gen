    "intro": "Gaylussacia rhodendra, commonly known as the red-berried huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red, edible berries in the fall. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn red in the autumn, adding visual interest to the landscape. The shrub thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
