It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate dry conditions."
