    "intro": "Guioa diplopetala f. dentata, commonly known as the toothed guioa, is a variant of the guioa species native to the Philippines. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves with serrated or toothed margins. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by yellowish or reddish berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. The toothed leaf structure distinguishes this form from other guioa varieties and contributes to its ornamental value."
