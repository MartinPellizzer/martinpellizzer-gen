It features dense, compact growth with small, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white to grayish pubescence. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flower heads that are typically clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to wet or semi-aquatic environments."
