    "intro": "Gossypium brevilanatum, commonly known as the short-leaved cottonweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other cotton and hibiscus species. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, lobed leaves, and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a burs, which aid in seed dispersal. Gossypium brevilanatum is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
