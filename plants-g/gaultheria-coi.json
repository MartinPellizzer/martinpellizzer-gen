    "intro": "Gaultheria coi, commonly known as the Chilean wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and heathers. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Its berries, which are typically red or black, are edible and have a peppery, aromatic flavor. Gaultheria coi is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
