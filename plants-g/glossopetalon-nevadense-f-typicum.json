    "intro": "Glossopetalon nevadense f. typicum, commonly known as the Nevada glossopetalon, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Nevada. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and related plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for high-elevation ecosystems."
