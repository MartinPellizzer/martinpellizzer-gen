    "intro": "Guzmania foetida, commonly known as the stinking pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble a pineapple, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a central rosette of grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small aquatic life. Guzmania foetida produces striking inflorescences with showy flowers, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
