    "intro": "Gymnanthemum bellinghamii, commonly known as the Bellingham's sand verbena, is a rare flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its delicate, small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. It has narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a sensitive species requiring conservation efforts."
