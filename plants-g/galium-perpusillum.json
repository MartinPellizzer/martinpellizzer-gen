    "intro": "Galium perpusillum, commonly known as dwarf wood sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. It has a creeping habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Galium perpusillum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
