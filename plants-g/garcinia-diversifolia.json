    "intro": "Garcinia diversifolia, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western and central Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. Garcinia diversifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
