    "intro": "Galordia alternifolia, commonly known as the zigzag flame tree, is a striking tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped leaves that alternate along the stems, giving it a unique visual appearance. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Galordia alternifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
