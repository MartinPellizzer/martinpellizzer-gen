    "intro": "Galanthus nivalis var. minus, commonly known as the dwarf snowdrop, is a variety of the snowdrop plant characterized by its smaller size compared to the typical G. nivalis. It features delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers with a greenish-yellow spathe, blooming in early spring. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland floors and rock crevices, where it forms dense, compact clumps. Due to its ornamental value and early bloom, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders."
