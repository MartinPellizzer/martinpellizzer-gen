    "intro": "Glandularia tristachya, commonly known as the sticky fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a sticky texture and aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in open plains and rocky soils. Glandularia tristachya is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in treating skin conditions and inflammation."
