    "intro": "Grindelia nuda var. nuda, commonly known as the naked gumweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow and produce small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinators."
