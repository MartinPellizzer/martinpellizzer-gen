    "intro": "Gymnema sagittatum, commonly known as the arrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by pods that contain seeds with silky hairs. Gymnema sagittatum is known for its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals and has been used in traditional medicine. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
