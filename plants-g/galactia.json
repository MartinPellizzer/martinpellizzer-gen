    "intro": "Galactia, commonly known as the milkvetch, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to various regions of the Americas and are characterized by their trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. Many species produce pods that contain seeds, and some are known for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them valuable in ecological and agricultural contexts. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, with some being used in traditional medicine or as forage for livestock. Galactia species are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
