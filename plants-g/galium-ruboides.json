    "intro": "Galium ruboides, commonly known as redstem stellaria, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a low-growing herbaceous species that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, and its stems are often reddish in color, giving it its common name. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Galium ruboides plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value."
