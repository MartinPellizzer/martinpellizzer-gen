    "intro": "Gastrochilus rutilans, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green foliage and its showy, lip-shaped flowers that range from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often with a distinct, spurred lip that aids in pollination by insects. Gastrochilus rutilans is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
