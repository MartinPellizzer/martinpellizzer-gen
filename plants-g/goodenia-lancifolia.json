    "intro": "Goodenia lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved goodenia, is a perennial herb native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in arid or semi-arid regions. Goodenia lancifolia is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and adaptability to drought conditions."
