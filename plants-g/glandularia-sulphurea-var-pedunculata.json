It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that aid in water retention. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The glandular structures on its leaves and stems contribute to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations."
