It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers. The leaves are typically serrated and have a slightly hairy texture, while the stems are often reddish in color. This variety is distinguished by its pale white or cream-colored veins on the leaves, which set it apart from other geranium species. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
