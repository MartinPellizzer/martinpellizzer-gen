    "intro": "Grewia rugosifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf globemallow, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are characterized by their rough, textured surface. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. It produces small, round fruits that are typically consumed by birds and small mammals. Grewia rugosifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in arid environments."
