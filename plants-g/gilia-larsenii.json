    "intro": "Gilia larsenii, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, radially symmetric flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs to reduce water loss. Gilia larsenii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
