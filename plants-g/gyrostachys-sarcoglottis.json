    "intro": "Gyrostachys sarcoglottis, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in hot, dry climates with well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Gyrostachys sarcoglottis is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
