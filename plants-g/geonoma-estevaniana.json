    "intro": "Geonoma estevaniana, commonly known as the Estevaniana fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in lowland rainforests. Its rhizome produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their aesthetic appeal."
