    "intro": "Geonoma aricanga, commonly known as the Aricanga brake fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often clustered at the base, forming a compact rosette. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and colonize shaded, moist environments. Geonoma aricanga is often found in humid, lowland forests and is adapted to thrive in partial to full shade."
