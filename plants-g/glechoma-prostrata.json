    "intro": "Glechoma prostrata, commonly known as creeping ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with scalloped edges and produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that can cover the ground effectively. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its aromatic leaves and adaptability make it a common weed in gardens and lawns."
