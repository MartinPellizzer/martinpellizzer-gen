    "intro": "Gongora unicolor, commonly known as the white orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking white petals and a unique, elongated lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Gongora unicolor has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils where it thrives. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
