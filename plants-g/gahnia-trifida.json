    "intro": "Gahnia trifida, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tussock-like growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, stiff, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Gahnia trifida is typically found in moist or wetland habitats, where it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
