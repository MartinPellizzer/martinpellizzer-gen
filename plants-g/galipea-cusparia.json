    "intro": "Galipea cusparia, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small tree or shrub that typically grows in brackish or saline water, adapting to tidal environments. The plant has dark green, ovate leaves with a waxy surface, and it produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can float and disperse in water. Galipea cusparia plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial wildlife."
