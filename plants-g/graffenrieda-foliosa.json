It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, golden pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
