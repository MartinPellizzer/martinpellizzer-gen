    "intro": "Gypsophila laricina, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils. It is adapted to cold climates and is typically found in subalpine and alpine zones. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
