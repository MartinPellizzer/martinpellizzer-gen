It features prostrate or ascending stems that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, silver-white hairs. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and also bear a similar hairy coating. Small, white to pale green flowers are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and roadside areas."
