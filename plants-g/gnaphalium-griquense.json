    "intro": "Gnaphalium griquense, commonly known as the Grootfontein everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces numerous tiny white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Gnaphalium griquense is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to semi-arid environments."
