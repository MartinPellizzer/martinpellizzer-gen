It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. The leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
