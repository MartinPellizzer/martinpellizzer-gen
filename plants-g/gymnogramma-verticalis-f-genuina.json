    "intro": "Gymnogramma verticalis f. genuina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf staghorn fern, is a fern species characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. It features glossy, lance-shaped fronds that are often curled at the tips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical regions. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in shaded gardens and greenhouses."
