    "intro": "Genista caespitosa, commonly known as creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features dense, upright clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and evergreen, providing year-round structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
