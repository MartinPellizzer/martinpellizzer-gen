    "intro": "Gomphocarpus lineolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its latex sap is milky and can cause skin irritation, a common trait among milkweeds. Gomphocarpus lineolatus is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
