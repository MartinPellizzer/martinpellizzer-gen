    "intro": "Grevillea vestita var. subbiternata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waratah, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its striking, crimson-red flower spikes that emerge from a dense cluster of narrow, strap-like leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Its flowers are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds, particularly honeyeaters, contributing to its ecological significance. The variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Grevillea vestita."
