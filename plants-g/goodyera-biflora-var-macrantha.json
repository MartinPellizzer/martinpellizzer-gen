    "intro": "Goodyera biflora var. macrantha, commonly known as the Macrantha Pansy Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded forest floors and requires high humidity and well-drained, acidic soil. The plant produces intricate, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive purple-tinged lip. Its leaves are elliptical and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
