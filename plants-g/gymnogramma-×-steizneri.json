    "intro": "Gymnogramma \u00d7 steizneri, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Gymnogramma cuneata and Gymnogramma japonica. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, sword-shaped fronds that are typically green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its fronds are often arranged in a compact, upright manner. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. Gymnogramma \u00d7 steizneri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in indoor or shaded garden settings."
