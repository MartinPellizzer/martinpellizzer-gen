    "intro": "Glyceria striata subsp. neogaea, commonly known as the narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinct midrib. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
