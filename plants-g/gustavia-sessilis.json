It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red, often with a yellow or orange center. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Gustavia sessilis is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and humid environments."
