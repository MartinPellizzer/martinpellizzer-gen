    "intro": "Gymnocalycium walteri, commonly known as the Walter's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its globular, spiny stems that are typically green or blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Gymnocalycium walteri is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it well-suited for desert environments."
