    "intro": "Glyce maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, silver-green leaves and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. Its unique morphology helps it withstand harsh maritime conditions, including strong winds and salt spray. Glyce maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
