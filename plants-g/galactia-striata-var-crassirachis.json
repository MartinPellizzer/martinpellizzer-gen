It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to reddish-brown flowers arranged in clusters. The plant is characterized by its thick, woody stems and is often found in rocky soils and desert environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, leathery pod that splits open when mature."
