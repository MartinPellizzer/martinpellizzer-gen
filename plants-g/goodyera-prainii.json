    "intro": "Goodyera prainii, commonly known as the Indian velvet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Its leaves are leathery and have a waxy texture, which helps retain moisture in its humid habitat. Goodyera prainii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
