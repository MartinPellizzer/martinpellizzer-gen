    "intro": "Galium setaceum f. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is a low-growing herb with slender, ascending stems that are typically hairless, as indicated by the \"glabrum\" designation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, though the variety is noted for its reduced pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
