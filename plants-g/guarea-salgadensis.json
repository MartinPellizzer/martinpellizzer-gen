    "intro": "Guarea salgadensis, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and distinctive, spiny fruits that contain the seeds used to produce Brazil nuts. The tree can grow up to 50 meters tall and has a dense, buttressed trunk that helps it thrive in the humid, nutrient-poor soils of the rainforest. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. The plant plays a vital role in the ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
