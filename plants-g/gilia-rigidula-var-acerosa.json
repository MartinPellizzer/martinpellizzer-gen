It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing bright yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun.
