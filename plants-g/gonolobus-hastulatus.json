    "intro": "Gonolobus hastulatus, commonly known as the swordleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive sword-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-like flowers that bloom in shades of purple and blue. The plant belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, which includes many other climbing and trailing vines. It typically grows as a herbaceous annual or perennial, often found in moist, sunny habitats. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, berry-like capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind or animal contact."
