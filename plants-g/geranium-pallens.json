    "intro": "Geranium pallens, commonly known as the white geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy white or pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Geranium pallens thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
