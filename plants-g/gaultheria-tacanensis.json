It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. Gaultheria tacanensis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and high-altitude grasslands. Its leaves contain aromatic compounds, contributing to its use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
