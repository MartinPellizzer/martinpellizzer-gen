    "intro": "Gleichenia hispida, commonly known as the hairy Gleichenia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often hairy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas, and is native to parts of Asia and Australia. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered along the margins of the fronds. Gleichenia hispida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
