    "intro": "Goniophlebium villeminianum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to regions of Africa and thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
