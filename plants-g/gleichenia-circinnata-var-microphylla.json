    "intro": "Gleichenia circinnata var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved chain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are typically shorter than those of the typical variety. The plant forms dense, mat-like growths on rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
