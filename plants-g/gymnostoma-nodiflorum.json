    "intro": "Gymnostoma nodiflorum, commonly known as the clustered-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds and other animals. Its roots penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients, while it performs photosynthesis independently. Gymnostoma nodiflorum is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested areas."
