    "intro": "Gymnocalycium marekiorum subsp. sanjoseanum, commonly known as the San Jose cactus, is a species of cactus native to central Chile. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green stems. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
