It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy, inflated pods and are often used in traditional medicine. Galactia herradurensis is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with root nodules."
