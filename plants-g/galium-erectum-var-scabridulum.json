    "intro": "Galium erectum var. scabridulum, commonly known as the rough bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, ascending stems that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptical, and have a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
