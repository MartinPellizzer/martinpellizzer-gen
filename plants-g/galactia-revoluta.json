    "intro": "Galactia revoluta, commonly known as the curled milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain seeds coated in a sticky, milky substance, which can adhere to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal. Galactia revoluta is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor, well-drained conditions. Its ecological role includes providing forage for wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat."
