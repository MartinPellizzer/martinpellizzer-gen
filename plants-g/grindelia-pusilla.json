It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its spread in arid environments. Grindelia pusilla is adapted to thrive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert and coastal ecosystems."
