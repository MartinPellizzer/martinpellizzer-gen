    "intro": "Goodenia filiformis var. minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered goodenia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Australia. It features slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and arranged alternately. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in spring and attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
