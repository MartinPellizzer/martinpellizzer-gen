It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early fall, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The varietal distinction, lawrencei, highlights its unique morphological features compared to other varieties of Gnaphalium collinum."
