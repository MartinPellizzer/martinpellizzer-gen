    "intro": "Gynandropsis decipiens, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has a basal rosette of silver-green leaves with a rough texture, and its flowers are yellow, typically appearing in summer. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Gynandropsis decipiens is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
