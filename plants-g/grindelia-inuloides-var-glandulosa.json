    "intro": "Grindelia inuloides var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular bitterbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its aromatic, resinous scent. Its leaves are covered in glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance, which helps protect it from herbivores and moisture loss. This species is often found in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes."
