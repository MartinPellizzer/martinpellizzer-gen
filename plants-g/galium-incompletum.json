    "intro": "Galium incompletum, commonly known as the incomplete bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves. The plant typically produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often hairy and have a slightly aromatic scent, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium incompletum is often found in the understory of forests, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
