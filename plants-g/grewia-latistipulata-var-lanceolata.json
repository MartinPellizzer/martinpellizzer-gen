    "intro": "Grewia latistipulata var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It features lanceolate leaves that are typically 5\u201315 cm long and 1\u20132 cm wide, with a smooth, glossy upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in terminal clusters, followed by orange-red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
