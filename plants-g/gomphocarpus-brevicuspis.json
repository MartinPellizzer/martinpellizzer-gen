    "intro": "Gomphocarpus brevicuspis, commonly known as the small-horned milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Gomphocarpus brevicuspis is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
