    "intro": "Gynandropsis trichopus, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
