    "intro": "Goniopteris monosora, commonly known as the single-veined fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically bright green and have a distinctive, intricate venation pattern. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studying fern morphology and evolutionary adaptations."
