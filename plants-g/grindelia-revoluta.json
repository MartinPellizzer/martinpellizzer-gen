    "intro": "Grindelia revoluta, commonly known as the desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its resinous sap has been used traditionally by Native American tribes for medicinal purposes. Grindelia revoluta plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
