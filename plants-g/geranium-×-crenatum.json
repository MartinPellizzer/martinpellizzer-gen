    "intro": "Geranium \u00d7 crenatum, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, slightly lobed leaves that resemble ivy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in hanging baskets or as ground cover due to its dense foliage. Geranium \u00d7 crenatum is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
