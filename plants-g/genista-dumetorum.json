    "intro": "Genista dumetorum, commonly known as the creeping buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. It thrives in poor, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and open woodlands. Its hardy nature makes it a common weed in disturbed habitats."
