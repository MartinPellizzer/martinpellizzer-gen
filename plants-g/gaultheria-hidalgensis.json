    "intro": "Gaultheria hidalgensis, commonly known as the Hidalgo wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many shrubs and small trees adapted to acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. The berries of Gaultheria hidalgensis are edible and have a sharp, spicy flavor, similar to that of the common wintergreen."
