    "intro": "Gnaphalium involucratum, commonly known as the clustered everlasting, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces a fine, powdery coating on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This species is also valued for its use in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms."
