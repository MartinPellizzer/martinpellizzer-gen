    "intro": "Gentiana coccinea, commonly known as the scarlet gentian, is a striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its vivid red to orange flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of down, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The genus Gentiana belongs to the family Gentianaceae, known for its showy, blue or yellow flowers, though G. coccinea stands out with its intense red color."
