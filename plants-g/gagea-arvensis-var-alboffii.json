    "intro": "Gagea arvensis var. alboffii, commonly known as the white-flowered gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers. The plant produces a bulbous underground stem that serves as a storage organ for nutrients. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
