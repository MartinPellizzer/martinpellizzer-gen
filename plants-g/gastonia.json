These plants are characterized by their velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Gastonia species are typically grown as houseplants due to their preference for warm, humid environments. They have a compact growth habit and are prized for their ornamental value. The flowers are usually borne on upright stalks and bloom throughout the year under proper care."
