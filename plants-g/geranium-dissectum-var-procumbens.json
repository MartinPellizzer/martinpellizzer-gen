    "intro": "Geranium dissectum var. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping geranium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The leaves are finely dissected, with a serrated margin, giving the plant a delicate, lace-like appearance. It produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers throughout the growing season. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value."
