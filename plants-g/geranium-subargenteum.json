    "intro": "Geranium subargenteum, commonly known as silver geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features succulent, silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for both gardeners and botanists."
