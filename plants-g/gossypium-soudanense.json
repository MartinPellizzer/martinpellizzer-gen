    "intro": "Gossypium soudanense, commonly known as Sudan grass, is a species of cotton plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its fibrous cotton bolls and woody stems, typical of the genus Gossypium. The plant thrives in warm, arid climates and is adapted to poor soil conditions. Its leaves are alternate and simple, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Gossypium soudanense is primarily cultivated for its fibers, which are used in textile production."
