    "intro": "Garcinia quadrifaria, commonly known as the four-leafed garcinia, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in whorls of four, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which contain a single seed. Garcinia quadrifaria is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique leaf structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
