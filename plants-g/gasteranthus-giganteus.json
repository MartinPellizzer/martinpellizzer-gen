    "intro": "Gasteranthus giganteus, commonly known as the giant globose bellflower, is a striking member of the Rubiaceae family native to South America. This plant is characterized by its large, showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically bright red or orange, with a unique structure that resembles a small lantern. The flowers are bilaterally symmetrical and feature a prominent, fleshy, tubular throat that serves as a nectar reservoir. The plant produces small, round berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Gasteranthus giganteus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
