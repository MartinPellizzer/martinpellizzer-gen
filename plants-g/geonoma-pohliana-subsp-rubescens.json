    "intro": "Geonoma pohliana subsp. rubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that often have a reddish tint along the veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
