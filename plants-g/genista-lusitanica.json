    "intro": "Genista lusitanica, commonly known as the Portuguese broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and north Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, sunny environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three narrow, leathery leaflets. Genista lusitanica is adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
