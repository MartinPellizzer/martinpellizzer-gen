    "intro": "Galianthe vaginata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and can become invasive in certain environments. Galianthe vaginata is often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil."
