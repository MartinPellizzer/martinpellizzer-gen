    "intro": "Geissoloma lateriflorum, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are basal, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Geissoloma lateriflorum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
