    "intro": "Graffenrieda scandens, commonly known as the climbing bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features climbing stems that can reach lengths of up to 10 feet, supported by tendrils that allow it to climb other plants or structures. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in the summer months. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. Graffenrieda scandens is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
