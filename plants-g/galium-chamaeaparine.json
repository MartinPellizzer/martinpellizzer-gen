    "intro": "Galium chamaeaparine, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped, with a silvery or grayish underside that gives it its common name. Galium chamaeaparine is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
