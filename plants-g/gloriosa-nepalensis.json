It belongs to the family Colocasiaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular, orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a rhizomatous root system and has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy in appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is also considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
