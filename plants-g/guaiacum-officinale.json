    "intro": "Guaiacum officinale, commonly known as the gumbo-limbo, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark that peels off in thin layers, and its simple, opposite leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, orange or red fruits containing several seeds. Its latex sap has been historically used for medicinal purposes, including treating wounds and inflammation. The tree is also valued for its ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in tropical environments."
