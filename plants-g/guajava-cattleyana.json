    "intro": "Guajava cattleyana, commonly known as the orchid cattleya, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange with intricate patterns. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, meaning it grows in a branching pattern with new shoots forming at the base of the previous ones. Its leaves are broad, elliptical, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The orchid is popular among horticulturists for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
