It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments.
