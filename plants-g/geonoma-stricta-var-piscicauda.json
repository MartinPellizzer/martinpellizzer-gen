    "intro": "Geonoma stricta var. piscicauda, commonly known as the fish-tail fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately divided fronds that resemble the tail of a fish, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a dense cluster of roots that anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, and it thrives in high humidity and indirect light. It is often used as an ornamental plant in tropical gardens and as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability."
