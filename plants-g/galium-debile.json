It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium debile is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
