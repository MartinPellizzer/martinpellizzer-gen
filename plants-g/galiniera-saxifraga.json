    "intro": "Galiniera saxifraga, commonly known as the rock heath, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its botanical features include a woody stem and small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. Galiniera saxifraga is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
