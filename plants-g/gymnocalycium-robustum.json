    "intro": "Gymnocalycium robustum, commonly known as the robustus cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, thick stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in the evening. Gymnocalycium robustum is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its succulent stems. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
