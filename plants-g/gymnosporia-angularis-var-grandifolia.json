    "intro": "Gymnosporia angularis var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its angular, spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody capsule, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. This species is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to harsh, drought-prone environments."
