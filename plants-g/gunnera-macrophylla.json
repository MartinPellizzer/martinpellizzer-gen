    "intro": "Gunnera macrophylla, commonly known as the giant rhubarb, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its enormous, shield-shaped leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter. The leaves are typically green with a reddish or purple underside, and they are covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its dramatic foliage."
