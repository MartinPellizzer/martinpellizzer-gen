It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant has a low-growing habit with wiry stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
