    "intro": "Griffonia physocarpa, commonly known as the African bean tree, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers followed by elongated, bean-like fruits that contain a single, large seed. Griffonia physocarpa is notable for its seeds, which contain high levels of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), a compound with potential health benefits. It is often cultivated for both ornamental and medicinal purposes."
