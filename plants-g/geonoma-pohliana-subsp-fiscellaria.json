    "intro": "Geonoma pohliana subsp. fiscellaria, commonly known as the Fiscell\u2019s fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in a loose, feathery pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
