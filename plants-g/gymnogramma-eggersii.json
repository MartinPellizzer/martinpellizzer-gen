    "intro": "Gymnogramma eggersii, commonly known as the Eggers' spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its epiphytic nature. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive pattern. Gymnogramma eggersii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
