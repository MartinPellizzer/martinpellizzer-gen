    "intro": "Glycine axilliflora, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen or the climbing bean, is a perennial leguminous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems that twine around supports. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Glycine axilliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its foliage. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil with partial to full sunlight."
