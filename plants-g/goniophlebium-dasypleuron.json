    "intro": "Goniophlebium dasypleuron, commonly known as the broad-pleated fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into broad, pleated segments, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
