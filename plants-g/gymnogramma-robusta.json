    "intro": "Gymnogramma robusta, commonly known as the robust spleenworts, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups called sori. Gymnogramma robusta thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both ecological and taxonomic studies."
