    "intro": "Geonoma trigona, commonly known as the three-angled fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, trifoliate (three-lobed) fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are often leathery and dark green, with a serrated edge. Geonoma trigona is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care."
