    "intro": "Gynura nudibasis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or giant rhubarb, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wastelands. The leaves are edible when young but become tough and fibrous as they mature."
