    "intro": "Goniothalamus monospermus, commonly known as the single-seeded goniothalamus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and unique fruit structure. The plant produces a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, berry-like fruit, which is an adaptation for animal dispersal. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a glossy surface that helps in photosynthesis in its tropical habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
