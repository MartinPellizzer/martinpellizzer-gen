    "intro": "Gilia inconspicua var. milesii, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in desert scrub habitats."
