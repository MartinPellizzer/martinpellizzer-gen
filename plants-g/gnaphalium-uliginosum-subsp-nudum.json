It is characterized by its thin, erect stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in peat bogs, marshes, and other moist, acidic environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to thrive in wet conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its ecosystem."
