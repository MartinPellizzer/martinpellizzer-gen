    "intro": "Goldfussia mearnsii, commonly known as the silverleaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its compound leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, followed by flat, woody pods that contain small, hard seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain areas."
