    "intro": "Gymnocalycium mucidum, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus that forms a dense, globular shape, often reaching up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong, sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Gymnocalycium mucidum is well-suited for cultivation in warm, sunny climates with well-draining soil."
