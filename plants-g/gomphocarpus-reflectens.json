    "intro": "Gomphocarpus reflectens, commonly known as the silverleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves that reflect light, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking orange-red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Gomphocarpus reflectens is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
