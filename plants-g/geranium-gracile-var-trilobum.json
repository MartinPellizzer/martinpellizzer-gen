It features slender, upright stems and small, palmately lobed leaves that are typically green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled, pink to red flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for wetland restoration and native garden landscapes."
