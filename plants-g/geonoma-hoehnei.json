    "intro": "Geonoma hoehnei, commonly known as the Hoehne's fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often used in horticultural settings. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Geonoma hoehnei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic qualities in botanical gardens."
