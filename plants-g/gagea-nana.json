    "intro": "Gagea nana, commonly known as the dwarf gagea, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are basal, grass-like, and often persist through the winter, contributing to its ornamental value. Gagea nana is valued in horticulture for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
