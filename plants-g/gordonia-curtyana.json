    "intro": "Gordonia curtyana, commonly known as the yellow-barked beech, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa. It is a member of the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, yellowish bark that peels in thin strips. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. Gordonia curtyana is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique bark and foliage."
