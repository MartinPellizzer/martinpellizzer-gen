    "intro": "Gomphocentrum rhizanthium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid that grows in the shaded understory of dense vegetation, often on the forest floor or in rocky crevices. The plant is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and its striking, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. It has a unique symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, it is considered one of the most endangered orchids in the world."
