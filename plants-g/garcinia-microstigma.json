    "intro": "Garcinia microstigma, commonly known as the Malabar tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles. The plant's most notable feature is its fruit, which is a small, round, yellow-orange drupe with a thick, acidic pulp. The fruit contains a single large seed and is often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. Garcinia microstigma thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in rainforests and secondary forests."
