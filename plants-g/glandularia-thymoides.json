    "intro": "Glandularia thymoides, commonly known as narrowleaf tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it a fuzzy appearance and help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Glandularia thymoides is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
