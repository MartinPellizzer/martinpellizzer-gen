    "intro": "Gymnogramma prehensibilis, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with specialized aerial roots that allow it to attach to trees and other structures. The fronds are typically pinnate, with a delicate, feather-like appearance, and they can grow quite large under suitable conditions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
