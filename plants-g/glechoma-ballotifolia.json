    "intro": "Glechoma ballotifolia, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its creeping habit, with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Glechoma ballotifolia is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in garden landscapes."
