    "intro": "Galium scabrum, commonly known as rough bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branched stems that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and have a slightly hairy surface. Galium scabrum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
