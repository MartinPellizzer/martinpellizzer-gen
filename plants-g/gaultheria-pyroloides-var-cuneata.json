    "intro": "Gaultheria pyroloides var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. These fruits are edible and have a sharp, aromatic flavor, often used in culinary applications. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments."
