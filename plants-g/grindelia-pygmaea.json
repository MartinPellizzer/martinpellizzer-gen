    "intro": "Grindelia pygmaea, commonly known as the pygmy gumweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flower heads and hairy, silver-gray foliage. The plant typically thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and rocky areas. Its small size and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh, dry climates. Grindelia pygmaea is also noted for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
