    "intro": "Galium commune var. scabrifolium, commonly known as roughleaf bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist, shaded environments. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a rough, sandpapery texture due to their dense pubescence. Small, white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters during late spring to early summer. This variant is distinguished by its distinctive leaf structure and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and wetlands."
