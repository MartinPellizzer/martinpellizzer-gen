    "intro": "Glomera palustris var. subintegra, commonly known as the marsh glomera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features a low-growing rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, enhancing nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in moist, boggy environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
