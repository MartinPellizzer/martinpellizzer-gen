    "intro": "Gilia cana subsp. speciformis, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The species is part of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is known for its ecological importance to pollinators."
