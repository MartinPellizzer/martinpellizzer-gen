    "intro": "Grammitis rupestris, commonly known as rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of moss-like tissue. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Grammitis rupestris is valued for its ornamental appearance and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
