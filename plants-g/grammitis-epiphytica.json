    "intro": "Grammitis epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, wiry fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Grammitis epiphytica plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for small organisms."
