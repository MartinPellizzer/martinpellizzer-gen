It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that vary in shape and size. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
