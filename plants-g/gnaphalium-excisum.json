    "intro": "Gnaphalium excisum, commonly known as the cutleaf everlasting, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers and hairy, often lobed leaves. Native to South America, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. Its common name reflects the tendency of its leaves to be cut or damaged, which may enhance its ornamental appeal."
