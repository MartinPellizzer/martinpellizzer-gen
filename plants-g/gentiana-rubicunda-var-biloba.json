    "intro": "Gentiana rubicunda var. biloba, commonly known as the red gentian, is a striking perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its vivid blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, while the stems are sturdy and often branched. This variant of Gentiana rubicunda is notable for its distinctive two-lobed petals, which set it apart from other members of the genus."
