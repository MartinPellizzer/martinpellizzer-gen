It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often growing in disturbed or saline environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three small, oval-shaped leaflets. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control."
