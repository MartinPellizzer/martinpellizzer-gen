    "intro": "Gahnia aristata, commonly known as the narrowleaf tussock grass, is a perennial tussock-forming grass native to Australia. It typically grows in wetlands, swampy areas, and along the margins of water bodies, preferring moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers. Gahnia aristata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
