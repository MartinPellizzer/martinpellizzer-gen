    "intro": "Glycine pubescens, commonly known as the hairy soybean, is a leguminous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the legume family. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several elliptical seeds. Glycine pubescens is often cultivated for its nutritional value, as the seeds are a source of protein. Its growth habit makes it suitable for both agricultural and ornamental purposes."
