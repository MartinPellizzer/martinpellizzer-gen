    "intro": "Grewia velutina, commonly known as velvet bush willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, round, yellow fruits that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are ovate and have a soft, velvety texture, giving the plant its common name. Grewia velutina is often found in savannas and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in preventing soil erosion."
