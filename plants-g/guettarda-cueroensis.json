    "intro": "Guettarda cueroensis, commonly known as the Cueroensis mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and is often found in humid, tropical environments. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role as both a parasite and a potential food source for certain insect species."
