    "intro": "Gastrochilus xuanenensis, commonly known as the Xuan'en orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
