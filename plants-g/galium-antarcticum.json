    "intro": "Galium antarcticum, commonly known as Antarctic bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the southern hemisphere, particularly found in South America, Africa, and Australia. It is a low-growing herb with slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to cold and dry environments. Galium antarcticum is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in temperate to subantarctic regions."
