It belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds. Gleichenia hawaiensis plays an important ecological role in the native Hawaiian ecosystem."
