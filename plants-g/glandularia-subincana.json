    "intro": "Glandularia subincana, commonly known as silverleaf verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, glandular hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its glandular hairs not only contribute to its visual appeal but also help reduce water loss, making it drought-tolerant. Glandularia subincana is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
