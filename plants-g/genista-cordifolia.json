    "intro": "Genista cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf broom, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems covered in small, spiny leaves that are heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
