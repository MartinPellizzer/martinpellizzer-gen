    "intro": "Geum rivale f. alpinum, commonly known as alpine avens, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm, characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
