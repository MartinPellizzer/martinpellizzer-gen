    "intro": "Galeopsis ladanum var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf hedge nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in whorled clusters, which are typical of the Scrophulariaceae family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
