    "intro": "Gymnadenia \u00d7 gracillima, commonly known as the slender grassponey, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits intermediate characteristics between its parent species, Gymnadenia borealis and Gymnadenia clypeata. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern in its native range."
