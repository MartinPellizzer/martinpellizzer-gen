    "intro": "Galium tianschanicum var. xerophyticum, commonly known as the Tianshan xerophytic bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure, which helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant features small, opposite leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. It is adapted to xerophytic conditions, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in semi-desert and mountainous regions."
