    "intro": "Guardiola rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf guardiola, is a perennial herb native to the humid forests of Central America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and have been traditionally used in local herbal remedies for their purported medicinal properties. The species is relatively rare and is considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
