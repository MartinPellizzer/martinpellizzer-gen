    "intro": "Galbanophora, commonly known as the gum tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their aromatic resins, which are often used in traditional medicine. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. Galbanophora species produce a sticky, yellowish gum that can be harvested from the bark. This gum has been used by Indigenous Australians for its antiseptic and healing properties."
