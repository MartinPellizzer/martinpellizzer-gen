It belongs to the family Gentianaceae, which includes many species with striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are characterized by their showy, tubular shape and vibrant blue coloration, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in a fine, hairy texture."
