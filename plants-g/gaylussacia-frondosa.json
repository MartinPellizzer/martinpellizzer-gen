    "intro": "Gaylussacia frondosa, commonly known as the blackhaw or sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heaths and blueberries, and is characterized by its woody stems and evergreen-like foliage. The plant produces white, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during late spring, which are followed by red, edible berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, oval-shaped, and have a smooth or slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist woodlands and swamps."
