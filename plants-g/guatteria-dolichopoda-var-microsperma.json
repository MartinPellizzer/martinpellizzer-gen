    "intro": "Guatteria dolichopoda var. microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are elliptical and glossy, and its fragrant, small white flowers. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
