    "intro": "Galium hamiltonii, commonly known as Hamilton's bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite leaves and small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and it produces tiny, bead-like fruits called drupes. Galium hamiltonii is often found in association with other woodland plants, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
