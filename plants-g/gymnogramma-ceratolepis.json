    "intro": "Gymnogramma ceratolepis, commonly known as the spiny gymnogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine, papery scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Gymnogramma ceratolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
