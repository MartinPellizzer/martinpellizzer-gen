    "intro": "Geranium andicola, commonly known as the Andean geranium, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils. The plant features upright stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Geranium andicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
