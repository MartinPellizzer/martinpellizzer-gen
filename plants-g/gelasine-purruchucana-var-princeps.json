    "intro": "Gelasine purruchucana var. princeps, commonly known as the royal gelasine, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
