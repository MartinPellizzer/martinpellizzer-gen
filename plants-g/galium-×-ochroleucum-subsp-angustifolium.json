    "intro": "Galium \u00d7 ochroleucum subsp. angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, ascending stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to parts of Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its creeping growth habit, which allows it to spread and colonize new areas. The leaves and stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
