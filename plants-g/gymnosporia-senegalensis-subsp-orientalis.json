It is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves, which are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by woody, three-lobed fruits that contain seeds. It is often found in sandy soils and can thrive in regions with low rainfall. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
