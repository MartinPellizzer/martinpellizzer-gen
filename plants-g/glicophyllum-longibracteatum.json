    "intro": "Glicophyllum longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with distinct, elongated bracts along the margins. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, primarily Trebouxia species, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. It typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, preferring sunny, well-drained substrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in regions with a Mediterranean or subtropical climate."
