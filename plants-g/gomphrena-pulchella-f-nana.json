    "intro": "Gomphrena pulchella f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf globe thistle, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features rounded, fleshy leaves and produces showy, pink to purple spherical flower heads that resemble small globes. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden settings for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It blooms throughout the summer and is known for its long-lasting flowers, making it a popular choice for cut flower arrangements. The dwarf form of this species makes it ideal for rock gardens and container planting."
