    "intro": "Geonoma spruceana var. heptasticha, commonly known as the seven-veined geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes a wide variety of flowering plants and epiphytes. The plant is characterized by its slender, arching stems and lance-shaped, glossy leaves that often exhibit a distinct seven-veined pattern. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often as an epiphyte on trees or in rocky crevices. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a component of tropical forest ecosystems."
