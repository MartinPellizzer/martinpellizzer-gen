It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple markings, especially on the undersides. The plant produces small, white flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
