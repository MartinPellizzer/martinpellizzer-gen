    "intro": "Galinsoga urticifolia, commonly known as hairy false fleabane, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its branches. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Galinsoga urticifolia is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
