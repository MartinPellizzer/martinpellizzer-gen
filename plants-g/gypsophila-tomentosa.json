    "intro": "Gypsophila tomentosa, commonly known as the snowball gypsophila, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with silvery-gray foliage due to its soft, woolly leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Gypsophila tomentosa is also valued for its use in floral arrangements due to its fluffy appearance and long-lasting blooms."
