    "intro": "Goniopteris burkartii, commonly known as the Burkart's shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting pollinators. The reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns."
