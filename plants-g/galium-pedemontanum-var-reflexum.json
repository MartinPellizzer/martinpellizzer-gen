    "intro": "Galium pedemontanum var. reflexum, commonly known as the reflexed wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and its flowers are white or pale pink, typically arranged in clusters. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and the fruits are small, three-lobed capsules that release seeds when mature. This variety is characterized by its reflexed (bent backward) leaflets, which distinguish it from other Galium species."
