    "intro": "Geonoma imperialis, commonly known as the imperial geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, often holding water. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Geonoma imperialis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
