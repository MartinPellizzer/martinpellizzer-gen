    "intro": "Goniothalamus, commonly known as the mountain betel or horned betel, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Annonaceae. These plants are native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, where they thrive in tropical rainforests. Goniothalamus species are characterized by their showy, fragrant flowers and distinctive, often twisted fruit capsules. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with alternate, simple, and often aromatic leaves. Due to their ornamental value and medicinal properties, some species are cultivated for horticultural and pharmacological purposes."
