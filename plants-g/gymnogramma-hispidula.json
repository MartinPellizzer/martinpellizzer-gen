    "intro": "Gymnogramma hispidula, commonly known as the hairy gymnogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Gymnogramma hispidula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens or as a houseplant."
