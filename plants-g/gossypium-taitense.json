    "intro": "Gossypium taitense, commonly known as the Taiti cotton, is a flowering plant native to the island of Taiti in the South Pacific. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its soft, fluffy fibers that are harvested for textile use. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has adapted to the tropical climate with high humidity and warm temperatures. Its flowers are usually pink or red, and it produces small, round capsules that contain the cotton fibers. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
