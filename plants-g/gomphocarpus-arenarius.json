    "intro": "Gomphocarpus arenarius, commonly known as the sand mat or desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its milky sap contains latex, which is typical of the milkweed genus. Gomphocarpus arenarius thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments."
