    "intro": "Guringalia, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, panicle-like inflorescences that produce abundant yellow flowers, giving it its common name. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and its bark is often smooth and grayish in appearance. Guringalia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
