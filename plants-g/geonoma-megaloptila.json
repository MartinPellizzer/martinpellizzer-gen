    "intro": "Geonoma megaloptila, commonly known as the large-leaf geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense clusters. The spore-producing structures, or sorus, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
