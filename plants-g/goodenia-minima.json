    "intro": "Goodenia minima, commonly known as the small goodenia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Australia. It typically features small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, yellow to orange flowers. The plant is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowering period usually occurs during the warmer months, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
