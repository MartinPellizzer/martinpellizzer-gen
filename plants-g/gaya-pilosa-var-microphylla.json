It has compound leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Its unique morphology makes it an important species for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
