    "intro": "Grammitis tintinnabula, commonly known as the bell-shaped fern, is a small epiphytic fern native to the wet tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often have a bell-like appearance, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water in its natural habitat. Grammitis tintinnabula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
