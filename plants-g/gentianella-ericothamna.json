    "intro": "Gentianella ericothamna, commonly known as the bog gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and peatland habitats in Europe. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in sphagnum moss-dominated environments. Gentianella ericothamna plays an important ecological role in maintaining biodiversity in its specialized habitat."
