    "intro": "Geranium laxum, commonly known as the loose geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Geranium laxum thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its compact growth habit and attractive flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
