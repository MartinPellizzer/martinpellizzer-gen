    "intro": "Gonocarpus micranthus subsp. ramosissimus, commonly known as the hairy sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It has dense, branching stems covered in fine, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fibrous roots enable it to survive in sandy soils with limited moisture. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
