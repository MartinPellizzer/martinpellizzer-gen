    "intro": "Grewia ossea, commonly known as the glassy bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that are covered in a waxy, translucent coating, giving it a glass-like appearance. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its fruit is a small, yellowish drupe that contains a single seed. Grewia ossea is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions."
