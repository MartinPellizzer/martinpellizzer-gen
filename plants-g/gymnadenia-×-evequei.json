    "intro": "Gymnadenia \u00d7 evequei, commonly known as the hybrid grasspinks, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Gymnadenia coryphylla and Gymnadenia odoratissima. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, preferring well-drained soils. It is native to parts of Europe, particularly in countries like France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
