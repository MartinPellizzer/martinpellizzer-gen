    "intro": "Geranium asiaticum f. rigidulum, commonly known as the rigidleaf geranium, is a compact, herbaceous perennial plant native to southern China. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy textures, and its foliage is characterized by rigid, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping for its visual appeal and low maintenance requirements."
