    "intro": "Goniothalamus burmanicus, commonly known as the Burmese sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant typically grows in lowland and hill forest areas, often in humid and shaded environments. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are fleshy berries containing seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
