It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are a food source for various wildlife species. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a hairy underside, giving it a fuzzy appearance. This variety is often found in moist, acidic soils in woodlands and along stream banks."
