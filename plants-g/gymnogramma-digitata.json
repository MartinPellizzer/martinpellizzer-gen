    "intro": "Gymnogramma digitata, commonly known as the fingerleaf staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, branching fronds that resemble the shape of a stag's antlers, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a distinct, toothed margin. Gymnogramma digitata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in suitable conditions."
