    "intro": "Gesneria salicifolia, commonly known as the willowleaf gesneria, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its elongated, willow-like leaves that are typically bright green and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria salicifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
