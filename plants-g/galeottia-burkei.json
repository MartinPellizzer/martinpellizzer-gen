    "intro": "Galeottia burkei, commonly known as the Burke's galeottia, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in a cluster, typically blooming in late spring. Galeottia burkei is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally by indigenous communities for its healing qualities. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
