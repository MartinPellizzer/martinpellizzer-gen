    "intro": "Germanea forskalaei, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky and sandy soils in alpine and tundra environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming during the short summer season. It has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that help it retain heat in cold climates. Germanea forskalaei is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal sunlight and nutrient-poor soils."
