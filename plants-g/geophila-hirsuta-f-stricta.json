    "intro": "Geophila hirsuta f. stricta, commonly known as the stiff-haired geophila, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its characteristic \"hirsuta\" name, which means hairy in Latin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its overall rugged appearance. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
