    "intro": "Guzmania diffusa, commonly known as the red-tipped peace lily, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It features a rosette of dark green leaves with bright red or orange tips, creating a vibrant visual contrast. The plant produces a tall inflorescence bearing small, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Guzmania diffusa is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
