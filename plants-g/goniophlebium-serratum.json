It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically serrated along the edges. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. Goniophlebium serratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
