    "intro": "Genista rigida, commonly known as rigid buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, often thorned stems that are typically red or brown in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in racemes during the spring, followed by small, leathery pods containing seeds. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a slightly hairy texture. Genista rigida is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates."
