    "intro": "Geranium humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt geranium, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It produces striking violet to purple flowers with five petals, often adorned with a distinctive white or pink spot at the base. The plant has a low-growing habit, with hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Geranium humboldtii is also valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
