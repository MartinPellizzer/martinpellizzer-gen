It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
