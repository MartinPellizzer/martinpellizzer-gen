    "intro": "Glyceria palustris, commonly known as swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Glyceria palustris is also valued for its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and poor soil conditions."
