    "intro": "Gomphocarpus transvaalensis, commonly known as the Transvaal milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has smooth, often hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves that are typically arranged oppositely. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Gomphocarpus transvaalensis is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in full sun."
