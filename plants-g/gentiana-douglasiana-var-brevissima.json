    "intro": "Gentiana douglasiana var. brevissima, commonly known as the short-stemmed gentian, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a short, stout stem. This variant is distinguished by its shorter stature compared to other gentian species, making it a unique and sought-after plant in botanical collections."
