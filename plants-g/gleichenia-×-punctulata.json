    "intro": "Gleichenia \u00d7 punctulata, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Gleichenia trichomanes and Gleichenia mirabilis. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures are underdeveloped, which is why it does not produce viable spores. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
