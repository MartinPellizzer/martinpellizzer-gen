    "intro": "Gentiana nyalamensis var. nyalamensis, commonly known as the Nyalam gentian, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variant is notable for its ecological significance and is often found in conservation-focused botanical studies."
