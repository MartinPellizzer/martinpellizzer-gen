It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate and often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air, a feature common in epiphytic orchids. The flowers exhibit a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink, and are often pollinated by insects or birds."
