    "intro": "Gomphia corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered gomphia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Gomphia corymbosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
