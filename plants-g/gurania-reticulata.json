It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, often colorful leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with vibrant colors that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
