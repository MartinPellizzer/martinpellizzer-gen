    "intro": "Gaultheria triquetra, commonly known as the three-lobed wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, commonly known as the heath family, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are evergreen, glossy, and elliptical in shape, often with a waxy texture. Gaultheria triquetra is also valued for its aromatic leaves, which contain methyl salicylate, giving it a distinctive wintergreen scent."
