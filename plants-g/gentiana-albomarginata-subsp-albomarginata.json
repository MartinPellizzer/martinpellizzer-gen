It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers with white margins, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy surface, while its stems are erect and often branched. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of interest in ecological studies due to its specific habitat requirements."
