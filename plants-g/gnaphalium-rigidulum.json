It is characterized by its erect, stiff stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as fields and roadsides, and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread across various environments."
