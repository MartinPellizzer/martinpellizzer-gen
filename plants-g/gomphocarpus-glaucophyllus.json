It is characterized by its hairy, blue-green foliage and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant's most distinctive feature is its unique, inflated seed pod that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Gomphocarpus glaucophyllus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
