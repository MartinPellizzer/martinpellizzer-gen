    "intro": "Galactia scarlatina var. brevibracteolata, commonly known as the scarlet milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, hairy stipules and bright red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces cylindrical pods containing several seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
