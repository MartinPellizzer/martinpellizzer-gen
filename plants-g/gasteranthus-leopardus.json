    "intro": "Gasteranthus leopardus, commonly known as the leopard's flower, is a strikingly colorful plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, often bi-colored petals that resemble a leopard's spots. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Gasteranthus leopardus is known for its unique morphology, with a swollen base that resembles a fruit, attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
