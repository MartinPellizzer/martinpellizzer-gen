    "intro": "Grindelia stricta subsp. venulosa, commonly known as the narrowleaf gumweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its aromatic foliage and unique floral structure make it an interesting subject for botanical study and ecological research."
