    "intro": "Graphorkis atrovirens, commonly known as the black-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking dark green leaves with prominent black veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in undergrowth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
