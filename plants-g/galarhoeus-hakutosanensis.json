    "intro": "Galarhoeus hakutosanensis, commonly known as the Hakutosan stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to Japan. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its flowers are small, clustered, and usually pale pink or white, blooming in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
