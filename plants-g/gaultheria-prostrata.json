    "intro": "Gaultheria prostrata, commonly known as the creeping wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are aromatic when crushed, containing compounds like methyl salicylate. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Gaultheria prostrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
