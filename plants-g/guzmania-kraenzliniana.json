    "intro": "Guzmania kraenzliniana, commonly known as the pink flamingo plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, pinkish-red bracts that resemble the feathers of a flamingo, giving it its common name. The plant features a central rosette of sword-shaped leaves that collect water, creating a mini-ecosystem. Its flowering stems produce small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. Guzmania kraenzliniana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush, colorful appearance."
