    "intro": "Gentiana patagonica f. pumila-uniflora, commonly known as the Patagonian gentian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southern Andes. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from September to November. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white down, giving it a soft appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
