    "intro": "Grewia seringeana, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn bright red in the autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Grewia seringeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
