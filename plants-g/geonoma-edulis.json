It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are typically located on the underside of its fronds. While not widely cultivated, it holds cultural and potential medicinal significance in some indigenous communities."
