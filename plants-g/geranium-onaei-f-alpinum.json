    "intro": "Geranium onaei f. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine geranium, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late summer. The leaves are palmately lobed, with a coarse texture and a slightly hairy surface, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
