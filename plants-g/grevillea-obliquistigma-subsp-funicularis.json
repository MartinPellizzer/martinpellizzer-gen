It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and bright red flowers that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in heathlands and coastal areas, thriving in full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and minimal water."
