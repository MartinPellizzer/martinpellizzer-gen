    "intro": "Galium ovalleanum, commonly known as the ovalleaf bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has a creeping habit with hairy stems. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Galium ovalleanum is often found in shaded environments and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
