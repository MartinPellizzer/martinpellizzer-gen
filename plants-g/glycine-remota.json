    "intro": "Glycine remota, commonly known as the remote sweet pea, is a climbing legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Glycine remota is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
