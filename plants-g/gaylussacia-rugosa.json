    "intro": "Gaylussacia rugosa, commonly known as the rough alpine cranberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes blueberries and heathers, and is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, red, edible berries that are similar in appearance to cranberries but are less commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a rough, textured surface, and it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. Gaylussacia rugosa is often found in rocky, exposed habitats such as slopes and forest edges."
