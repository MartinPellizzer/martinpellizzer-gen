    "intro": "Grona styracifolia, commonly known as the fragrant woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its bark is thick and reddish-brown, often peeling in thin, papery strips. Grona styracifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
