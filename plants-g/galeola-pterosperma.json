    "intro": "Galeola pterosperma, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. The flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
