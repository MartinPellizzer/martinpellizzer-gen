    "intro": "Glechoma italica, commonly known as Italian ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant has a creeping habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in gardens."
