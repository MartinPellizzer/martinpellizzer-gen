    "intro": "Grewia drummondiana, commonly known as the red gum tree, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that turn red in the autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Grewia drummondiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for local wildlife."
