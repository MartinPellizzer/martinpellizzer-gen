    "intro": "Geranium kauaiense, commonly known as Kauai geranium, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and streamside areas. The plant features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are showy, with five petals that range in color from pink to purple, and it blooms during the summer months. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
