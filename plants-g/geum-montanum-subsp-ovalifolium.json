    "intro": "Geum montanum subsp. ovalifolium, commonly known as the mountain avens, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to poor, rocky soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh mountain conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
