    "intro": "Geranium tuberosum var. radicatum, commonly known as the tuberous geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which store nutrients and help the plant survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms and drought tolerance."
