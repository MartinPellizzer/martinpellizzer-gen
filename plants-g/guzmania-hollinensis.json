    "intro": "Guzmania hollinensis, commonly known as the pink-flowered bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy inflorescence that typically features pink or red bracts. The plant's rosette-shaped leaves collect water, creating a small pool that supports a microhabitat for various aquatic organisms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Guzmania hollinensis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
