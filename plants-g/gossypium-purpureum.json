    "intro": "Gossypium purpureum, commonly known as the purple cotton plant, is a species of shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by fluffy bolls containing fibrous seeds. Its fibers are used in textile production, though it is less common than other cotton species. The plant thrives in warm, dry climates and is often found in arid regions."
