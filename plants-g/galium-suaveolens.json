    "intro": "Galium suaveolens, commonly known as sweet woodruff, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often fragrant when crushed. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common weed in moist, shaded areas. Galium suaveolens is known for its mild aromatic scent, which has been historically used in perfumes and herbal remedies."
