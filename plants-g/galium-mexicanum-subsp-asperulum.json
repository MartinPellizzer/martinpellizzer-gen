    "intro": "Galium mexicanum subsp. asperulum, commonly known as rough bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with opposite, linear to lanceolate leaves. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in cymes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its rough, hairy texture on the stems and leaves, contributing to its common name."
