    "intro": "Gastrodia elata f. pallens, commonly known as the pale-flowered gastrodia, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy rhizomes and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is epiphytic, growing on the trunks of trees in humid, shaded environments. Its medicinal properties have made it highly sought after, leading to overharvesting and habitat loss. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this rare botanical species."
