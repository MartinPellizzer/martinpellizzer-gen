    "intro": "Gela, commonly known as the \"Chinese evergreen,\" is a tropical plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with prominent veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often enclosed within a spathe, a modified leaf-like structure. Gela thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers indirect light. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clusters, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
