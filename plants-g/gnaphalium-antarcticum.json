    "intro": "Gnaphalium antarcticum, commonly known as the Antarctic groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southern hemisphere, particularly found in Antarctica and surrounding subantarctic regions. It is a low-growing herb with a mat-forming habit, often carpeting rocky or barren ground. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Gnaphalium antarcticum is adapted to extreme cold and can survive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient species in polar ecosystems."
