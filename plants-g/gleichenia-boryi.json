    "intro": "Gleichenia boryi, commonly known as the Bory's spikemoss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperjiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and dense clusters of needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Gleichenia boryi plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
