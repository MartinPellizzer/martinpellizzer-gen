    "intro": "Galium linearifolium, commonly known as slender bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground, and its leaves are linear to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and stems are often used in traditional herbal remedies, though it is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes. Galium linearifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
