    "intro": "Grevillea obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed waratah, is a striking shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and showy, red or pink floral spikes that bloom in spring. The plant's leaves are broadly elliptical and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure. Grevillea obtusifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
