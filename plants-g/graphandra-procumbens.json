    "intro": "Graphandra procumbens, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Graphandra procumbens plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
