    "intro": "Glechoma everardii, commonly known as the everard's ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its creeping habit and rounded, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its aromatic leaves and stems release a minty scent when crushed, a trait common in many members of the Lamiaceae family. Glechoma everardii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks."
