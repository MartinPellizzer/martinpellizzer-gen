    "intro": "Glandularia moricolor, commonly known as the purple glandular bluestem, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late summer. The plant has glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name and help in reducing water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Glandularia moricolor is a valuable plant for pollinators and is also used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value."
