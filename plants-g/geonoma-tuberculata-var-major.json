    "intro": "Geonoma tuberculata var. major, commonly known as the tuberculate fern, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds with prominent tubercles. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually divided into narrow, linear segments with a serrated or toothed margin. The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
