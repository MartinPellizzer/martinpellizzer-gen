    "intro": "Gagea villosa f. semiglabra, commonly known as the velvetleaf gagea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters during early spring. Its foliage is generally less hairy compared to the typical form of Gagea villosa, giving it a smoother appearance. It thrives in woodland and shady environments, often found in moist, well-drained soils."
