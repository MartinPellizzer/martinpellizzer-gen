    "intro": "Gymnocalycium stellatum var. obductum, commonly known as the velvet cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Argentina. It features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its stems are ribbed and can store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. This variety is prized for its unique texture and ornamental value in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
