    "intro": "Gymnocalycium anisitsii subsp. tucavocense, commonly known as the Tucavocense cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in white to yellow spines. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
