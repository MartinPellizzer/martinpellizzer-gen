    "intro": "Genista tinctoria var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf yellow broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that give the plant a feathery appearance. This variety is closely related to the common yellow broom, but it differs in its broader leaf structure. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soils."
