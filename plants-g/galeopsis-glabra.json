It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from June to August. Its stems are hairy and often branched, and it thrives in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Galeopsis glabra is often found in moist environments and is characterized by its distinctive, net-like veins on the leaves."
