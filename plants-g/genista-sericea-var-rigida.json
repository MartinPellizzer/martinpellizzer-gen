    "intro": "Genista sericea var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid greenbriar, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control."
