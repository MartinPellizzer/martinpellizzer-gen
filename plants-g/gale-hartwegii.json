    "intro": "Gale hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Gale hartwegii thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss."
