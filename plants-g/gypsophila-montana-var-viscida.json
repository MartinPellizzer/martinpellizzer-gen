    "intro": "Gypsophila montana var. viscida, commonly known as sticky gypsophila, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
