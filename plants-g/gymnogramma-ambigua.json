    "intro": "Gymnogramma ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous gymnogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, clustered sori on the underside of the leaves. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Gymnogramma ambigua is often found in forest understories, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem. Its reproductive structures are well-developed, facilitating spore dispersal and propagation in suitable habitats."
