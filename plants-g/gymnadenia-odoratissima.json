    "intro": "Gymnadenia odoratissima, commonly known as the sweet-flag orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, pale yellow or greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often in meadows or woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, rounded pseudobulbs that store nutrients. The species is noted for its sweet, honey-like fragrance, which is most pronounced in the evening."
