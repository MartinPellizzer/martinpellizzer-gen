    "intro": "Genista herbacea, commonly known as the creeping yellow broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, branched stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are small, narrow, and evergreen, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Genista herbacea is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
