    "intro": "Glyceria aquatica var. scabra, commonly known as the rough watergrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its scientific name. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelets that produce wind-pollinated flowers. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
