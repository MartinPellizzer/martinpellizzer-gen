    "intro": "Guzmania formosa, commonly known as the flame plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in the canopies of rainforests. The plant is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that resembles a torch, which can range from red to orange in hue. Its rosette-shaped leaves are thick and waxy, designed to collect and store water. Guzmania formosa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its vibrant appearance."
