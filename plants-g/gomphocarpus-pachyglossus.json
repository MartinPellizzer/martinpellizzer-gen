    "intro": "Gomphocarpus pachyglossus, commonly known as the sticky devil's backbone, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, spiny fruit capsules that resemble a backbone, hence its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
