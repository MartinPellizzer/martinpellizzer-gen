    "intro": "Guajava refracta, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It possesses prop roots that help stabilize the soil and facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged conditions. The plant's leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. It produces small, pinkish flowers that develop into dark purple berries. Guajava refracta plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
