    "intro": "Geranium cinereum var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock geranium, is a compact, low-growing perennial native to rocky habitats in southern Africa. It features small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to September. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact form and long blooming period."
