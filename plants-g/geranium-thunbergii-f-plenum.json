    "intro": "Geranium thunbergii f. plenum, commonly known as the Wooly Geranium, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb with a distinctive appearance. Its stems are densely covered in soft, white, woolly hairs, giving it a fluffy, almost cloud-like texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value lies in its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
