It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that emit a pleasant scent when crushed. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental and ecological landscaping."
