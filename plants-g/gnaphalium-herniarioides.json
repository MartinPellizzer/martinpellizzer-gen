    "intro": "Gnaphalium herniarioides, commonly known as the hairy leaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its small, showy flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. The leaves are often hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
