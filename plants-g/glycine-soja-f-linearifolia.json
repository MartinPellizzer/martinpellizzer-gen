    "intro": "Glycine soja f. linearifolia, commonly known as the linear-leaf soybean, is a botanical variant of the soybean plant characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves. This form exhibits distinct morphological features compared to the standard soybean, including a more linear leaf shape and sometimes reduced foliage density. It is native to East Asia and is often cultivated for its unique growth characteristics and potential agricultural uses. The plant retains the typical growth habits of soybeans, such as climbing vines and trifoliate leaves, but with notable variations in leaf morphology. Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of genetic diversity within the Glycine genus."
