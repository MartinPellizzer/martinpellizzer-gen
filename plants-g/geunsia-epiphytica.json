    "intro": "Geunsia epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic orchid, is a tropical plant that grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its aerial roots and ability to absorb moisture from the air. The plant typically has narrow, strap-like leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its unique growth habit and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for terrariums and indoor gardening."
