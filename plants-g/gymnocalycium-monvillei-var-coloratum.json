It features a swollen, globular stem that is often colored in shades of yellow, orange, or red, with a distinct white or pale green center. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This variety is prized for its vibrant appearance and relatively easy care requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
