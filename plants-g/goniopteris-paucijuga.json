    "intro": "Goniopteris paucijuga, commonly known as the few-lobed shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small pinnae that give the plant a lush, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
