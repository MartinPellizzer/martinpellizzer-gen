    "intro": "Glyceria ovatiflora, commonly known as the broad-leafed glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lipped flowers that are typically pale green to reddish in color. Glyceria ovatiflora is adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing mudflats and riverbanks. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to the ecological structure of wetland ecosystems."
