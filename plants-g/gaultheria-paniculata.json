    "intro": "Gaultheria paniculata, commonly known as the clustered wintergreen, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, aromatic flavor due to the presence of methyl salicylate. Gaultheria paniculata thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist woodlands and rocky areas."
