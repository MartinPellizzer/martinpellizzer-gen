It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
