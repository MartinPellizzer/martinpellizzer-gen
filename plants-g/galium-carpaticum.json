    "intro": "Galium carpaticum, commonly known as Carpathian bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite and often have a hairy texture, while its fruits are small, dry capsules that release seeds when mature. Galium carpaticum plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
