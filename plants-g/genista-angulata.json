    "intro": "Genista angulata, commonly known as angular broom, is a flowering plant in the Fabaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, typically growing in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features slender, angular stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Angular broom is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
