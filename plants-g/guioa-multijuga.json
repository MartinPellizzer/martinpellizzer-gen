    "intro": "Guioa multijuga, commonly known as the Philippine ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, aromatic bark. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for timber and traditional crafts."
