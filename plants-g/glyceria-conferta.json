    "intro": "Glyceria conferta, commonly known as narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas, along lake shores, and in other moist environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in regions with high water tables and can tolerate periodic flooding. Glyceria conferta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
