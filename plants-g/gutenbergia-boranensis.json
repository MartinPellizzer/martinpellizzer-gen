    "intro": "Gutenbergia boranensis, commonly known as the Boran ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the arid regions of Kenya. It is characterized by its pale greenish-white flowers and unique, elongated petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in fragmented populations. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator of ecological health in its native range."
