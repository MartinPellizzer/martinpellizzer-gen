    "intro": "Grewia asiatica var. vestita, commonly known as the velvet bushwillow, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive velvety appearance due to the dense, soft hairs covering its stems and leaves. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval or elliptical in shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or along riverbanks. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
