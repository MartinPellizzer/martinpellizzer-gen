    "intro": "Gleichenia clemensiae, commonly known as the Clemens' fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, strap-like fronds that are often divided into smaller, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Gleichenia clemensiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush, green appearance."
