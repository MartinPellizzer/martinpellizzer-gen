    "intro": "Gymnogramma procurrens, commonly known as the creeping gymnogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with delicate, linear pinnae that give the plant a lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
