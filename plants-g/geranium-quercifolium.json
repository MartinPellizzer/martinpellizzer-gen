    "intro": "Geranium quercifolium, commonly known as the oak-leaf geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its palmate, lobed leaves that resemble the shape of an oak leaf, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers in the summer months. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate floral display."
