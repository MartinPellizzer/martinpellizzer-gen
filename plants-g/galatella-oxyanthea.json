    "intro": "Galatella oxyanthea, commonly known as the golden flame lily, is a striking ornamental plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves that form a dense rosette at the base. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form clumps over time. Galatella oxyanthea is prized for its vibrant color and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
