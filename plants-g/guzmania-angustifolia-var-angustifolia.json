    "intro": "Guzmania angustifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble a pineapple, which are actually modified leaves. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with long, narrow, pointed leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like trichomes. It produces small white flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, followed by a cluster of red berries. This species is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
