    "intro": "Gastrosulum dichotomum, commonly known as the dichotomous gastrosulum, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine environments. It is characterized by its unique branching pattern, where the stem splits into two equal parts, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to minimize water loss in cold, high-altitude conditions. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, which bloom in early summer. Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, Gastrosulum dichotomum is considered a vulnerable species."
