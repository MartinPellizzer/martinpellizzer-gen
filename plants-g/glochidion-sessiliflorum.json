    "intro": "Glochidion sessiliflorum, commonly known as the sessile-flowered glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers, which are often obscured by the foliage. Glochidion sessiliflorum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the natural environment."
