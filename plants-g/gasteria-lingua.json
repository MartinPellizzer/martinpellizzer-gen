    "intro": "Gasteria lingua, commonly known as the tongue plant, is a succulent perennial native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with white or yellow markings. The plant produces tall, slender flower stalks that bear small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow or orange. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Gasteria lingua is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
