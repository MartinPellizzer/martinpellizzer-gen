    "intro": "Gigasiphon dolichocalyx, commonly known as the long-calyx giant siphon, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, featuring vibrant yellow petals and a prominent, elongated calyx. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is known for its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
