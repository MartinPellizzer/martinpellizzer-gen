    "intro": "Gunnera perpensa var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine gunnera, is a variant of the broadleaf gunnera species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, providing a striking visual presence. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. The species is notable for its ability to withstand strong winds and low temperatures, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
