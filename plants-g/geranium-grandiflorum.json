    "intro": "Geranium grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems with heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to red flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
