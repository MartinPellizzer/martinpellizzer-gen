    "intro": "Galium lenkoranicum, commonly known as the Lenkoran bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to parts of Eastern Europe and Western Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its range."
