    "intro": "Genlisea aurea, commonly known as the golden bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Lentibacillaceae and is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant thrives in wet, acidic environments such as marshes and bogs. Its small, yellow flowers are typically borne on slender stems. Genlisea aurea is notable for its specialized adaptations that allow it to supplement its nutrient intake by capturing and digesting small aquatic organisms."
