It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that turn from green to yellow as they mature. The fruit's rind contains a high concentration of hydroxycitric acid, which is used in dietary supplements.
