    "intro": "Grammitis subglabra, commonly known as the smooth grammitis, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glabrous, or smooth to the touch. The fronds are usually arranged in a rosette-like pattern, and the plant produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of the leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Grammitis subglabra is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
