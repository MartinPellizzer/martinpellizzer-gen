    "intro": "Goodenia salina, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, often blue or purple flowers and its ability to thrive in saline soils. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Goodenia salina is often found in coastal areas and salt lakes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its resilience to salt and drought makes it an important component of ecological restoration projects in saline habitats."
