    "intro": "Galium elegans f. vestitum, commonly known as the velvet bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy surface. Galium elegans f. vestitum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
