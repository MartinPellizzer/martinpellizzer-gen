    "intro": "Garnotia caespitosa var. longiuscula, commonly known as the tall spike rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that can reach significant heights. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, typically found at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green color. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
