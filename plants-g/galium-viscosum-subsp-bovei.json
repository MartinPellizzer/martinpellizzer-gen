    "intro": "Galium viscosum subsp. bovei, commonly known as sticky bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a glandular surface that contributes to its sticky texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
