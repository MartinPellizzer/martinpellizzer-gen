    "intro": "Guzmania loeflingiana, commonly known as the silver star bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from yellow to red, adding visual interest to its foliage. Its leaves are typically broad, leathery, and covered in a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Guzmania loeflingiana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
