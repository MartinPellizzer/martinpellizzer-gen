    "intro": "Grammitis dolorensis, commonly known as the sorrowful fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, which are arranged in a compact, clustered pattern. Due to its unique appearance and habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
