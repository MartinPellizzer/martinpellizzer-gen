    "intro": "Gonokeros hungaricus, commonly known as the Hungarian horned orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to Hungary. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring a single, erect stem that bears a single, showy flower. The plant has a short, fleshy rhizome and produces small, green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It blooms in late spring, producing a bright yellow or orange flower with a prominent, horn-like spur. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native region."
