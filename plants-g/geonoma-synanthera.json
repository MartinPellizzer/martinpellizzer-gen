    "intro": "Geonoma synanthera, commonly known as the panther's paw, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure, typical of bromeliads. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a waxy texture, aiding in water retention. Geonoma synanthera is often found growing on trees or in shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions."
