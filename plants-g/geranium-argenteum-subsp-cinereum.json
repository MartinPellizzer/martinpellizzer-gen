    "intro": "Geranium argenteum subsp. cinereum, commonly known as the silver geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
