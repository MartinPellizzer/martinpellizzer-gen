    "intro": "Grubbia rourkei, commonly known as the Rourke's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring a single, erect stem and a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a spike at the top of the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands, often growing in association with other rare plant species. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
