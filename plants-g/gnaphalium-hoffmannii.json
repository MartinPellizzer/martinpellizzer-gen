    "intro": "Gnaphalium hoffmannii, commonly known as Hoffmann's featherweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, often surrounded by bracts that give it a feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with finely divided leaves that help reduce water loss in its native habitat."
