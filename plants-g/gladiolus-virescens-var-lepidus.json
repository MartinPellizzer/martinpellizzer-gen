It features tall, sturdy stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, with a distinctive three-lobed spathe and a central spadix. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
