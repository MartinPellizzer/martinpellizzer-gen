    "intro": "Galega colonila, commonly known as the narrowleaf goat's rue, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Galega colonila is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
