    "intro": "Gagea setifolia var. aitchisoniana, commonly known as the Aitchison's slender gagea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at high altitudes. It is a perennial herb that produces bulbous structures for storage and propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
