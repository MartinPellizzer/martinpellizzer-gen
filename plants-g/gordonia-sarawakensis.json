    "intro": "Gordonia sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak gordonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are often clustered in inflorescences at the ends of branches. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
