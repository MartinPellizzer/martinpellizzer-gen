    "intro": "Geonoma irena, commonly known as the Irena's fern, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure, typical of bromeliads. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by colorful bracts, which attract pollinators. Geonoma irena is often found in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory."
