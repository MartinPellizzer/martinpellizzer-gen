    "intro": "Gasteranthus corallinus, commonly known as the coral bell, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its unique, coral-like bracts that enclose the small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces showy, colorful floral structures that resemble coral or sea anemones, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
