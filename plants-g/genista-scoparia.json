    "intro": "Genista scoparia, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of vegetation. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Genista scoparia is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or coastal environments."
