    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea var. brachycentra, commonly known as the short-stalked gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and meadows, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while the stems are erect and bear the showy flowers. This variety is distinguished by its shorter floral stems compared to the typical form of Gymnadenia conopsea."
