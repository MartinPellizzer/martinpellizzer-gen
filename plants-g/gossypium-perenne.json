    "intro": "Gossypium perenne, commonly known as upland cotton, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fluffy, seed-filled bolls that encase the cotton fibers, which are harvested for textile production. The plant has alternate, simple, ovate leaves with a hairy surface and produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or white. Its fibrous stems and leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs that aid in water retention. Gossypium perenne is a key species in global agriculture due to its economic importance and adaptability to various climates."
