    "intro": "Gentiana palustris, commonly known as the swamp gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas of North America. It features showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stem is typically unbranched and upright. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and along the edges of ponds. Gentiana palustris is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
