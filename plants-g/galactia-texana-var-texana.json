    "intro": "Galactia texana var. texana, commonly known as the Texas milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect, sparsely branched stems that produce small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces yellow to orange pods that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its range."
