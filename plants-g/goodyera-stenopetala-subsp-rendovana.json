    "intro": "Goodyera stenopetala subsp. rendovana, commonly known as the Rendova lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and intricate, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are arranged in a loose raceme and feature a distinct, three-lobed lip. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its limited distribution and unique morphology."
