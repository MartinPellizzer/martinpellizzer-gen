    "intro": "Galinsoga parviflora subsp. hispida, commonly known as common gallinsoga, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It features small, yellow flowers and hairy, branched stems that are often covered in stiff, glandular trichomes. The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and usually have a rough texture due to the presence of these hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. This species is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means."
