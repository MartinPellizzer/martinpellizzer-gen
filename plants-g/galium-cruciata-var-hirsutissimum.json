    "intro": "Galium cruciata var. hirsutissimum, commonly known as the hairy woodcrushers, is a variant of the woodcrusher plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features slender, branched stems covered in dense, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white to pinkish flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and often have a rough texture due to their hairy surfaces."
