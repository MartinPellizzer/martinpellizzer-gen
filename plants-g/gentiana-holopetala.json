    "intro": "Gentiana holopetala, commonly known as the white gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. The genus Gentiana is known for its showy, often blue or purple flowers, and G. holopetala is no exception, making it a notable species in botanical gardens and alpine environments."
