It is characterized by its delicate, wand-like stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens. Gaura filiformis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
