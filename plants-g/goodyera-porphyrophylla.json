    "intro": "Goodyera porphyrophylla, commonly known as the purple-leafed\u6753\u5170, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors, often in association with mosses and other epiphytic species. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
