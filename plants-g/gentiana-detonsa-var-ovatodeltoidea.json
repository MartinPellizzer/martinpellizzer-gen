It is characterized by its striking blue to sky-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped to ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat."
