    "intro": "Geostachys decurvata, commonly known as the twisted geostachys, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface. Geostachys decurvata is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats."
