    "intro": "Genista sessilifolia var. romanica, commonly known as the Roman broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. The plant produces bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. It is often found in rocky or dry soils, thriving in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes across southern Europe."
