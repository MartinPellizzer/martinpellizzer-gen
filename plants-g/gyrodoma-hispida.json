    "intro": "Gyrodoma hispida, commonly known as the hispid gyrodoma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a rough texture. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Gyrodoma hispida is often found in grassland habitats and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
