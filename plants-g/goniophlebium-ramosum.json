    "intro": "Goniophlebium ramosum, commonly known as the clustered fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that arise from a creeping rhizome, often forming dense clusters in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant's leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, narrow pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in ponds, ditches, and along the margins of streams. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
