    "intro": "Grumilea keilii, commonly known as the Keil's grumihua, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers come in shades of pink and white, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Grumilea keilii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
