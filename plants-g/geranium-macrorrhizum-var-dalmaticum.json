    "intro": "Geranium macrorrhizum var. dalmaticum, commonly known as the Dalmatian geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive reddish or purple underside. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense ground cover, contributing to its ornamental value."
