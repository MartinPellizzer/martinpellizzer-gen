    "intro": "Guzmania conglomerata, commonly known as the clustered flamingo flower, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that resembles a flamingo's beak, which can range in color from red to orange. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. Guzmania conglomerata is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
