    "intro": "Garuga clarkii, commonly known as the Clark's garuga, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and thick, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Garuga clarkii is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can endure prolonged droughts. It is often used in traditional medicine and is of interest for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
