    "intro": "Gymnosporia acuminata, commonly known as the thorned acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Gymnosporia acuminata is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in regions with low rainfall. Its thorny structure provides defense against herbivores, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
