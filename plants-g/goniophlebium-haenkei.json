    "intro": "Goniophlebium haenkei, commonly known as the Brazilian fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Native to Brazil, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
