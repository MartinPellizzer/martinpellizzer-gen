    "intro": "Glycine \u00d7 gracilis var. nigra-brunea, commonly known as the black-brown climbing bean, is a variant of the sweet pea genus Glycine. It is characterized by its dark, almost black foliage and stems, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically a mix of white and purple, blooming in summer. It is a vigorous climber, often used in ornamental gardens for its visual appeal. Botanically, it is a hybrid species, showing traits from both parent plants in the Glycine genus."
