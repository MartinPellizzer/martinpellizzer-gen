    "intro": "Garcinia lanceifolia var. oxyphylla, commonly known as the white-fruited garcinia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elliptical, orange-red fruits that are covered in a waxy coating. The fruits are typically harvested when they are fully mature, and they contain a single seed surrounded by a fleshy pulp. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique fruit characteristics."
