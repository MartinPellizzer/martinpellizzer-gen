    "intro": "Gymnogramma pozoi var. papaverifolia, commonly known as the pink-stemmed rock fern, is a variant of the Gymnogramma pozoi species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive pinkish hue on the underside, which gives it its common name. Its reproductive structures are borne on separate plants, and it relies on spores for propagation. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
