It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a tall spike bearing small, white flowers that bloom sequentially. Geonoma lanata is often found in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests and is adapted to thrive in low-light conditions."
