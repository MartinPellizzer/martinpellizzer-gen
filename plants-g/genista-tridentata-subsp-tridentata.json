It is native to the western United States, particularly California and Nevada, where it grows in dry, sunny habitats. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves. It produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in racemes. This subspecies is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils."
