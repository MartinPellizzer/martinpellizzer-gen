    "intro": "Gibsoniothamnus cornutus, commonly known as the horned thamnus, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs. Gibsoniothamnus cornutus is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences."
