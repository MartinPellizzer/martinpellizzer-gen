    "intro": "Grammitis burbidgei, commonly known as the Burbridge\u2019s spikemoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperjania. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its dimorphic leaves, with the lower leaves being smaller and more linear. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can retain moisture. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sporangia, which are located on the underside of the leaves. Grammitis burbidgei plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
