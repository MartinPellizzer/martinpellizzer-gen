    "intro": "Glandularia humifusa, commonly known as the creeping tickseed, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branched stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with glandular hairs that give it its scientific name. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, sticky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Glandularia humifusa is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in full sun."
