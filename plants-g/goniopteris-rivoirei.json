    "intro": "Goniopteris rivoirei, commonly known as the Rivoire's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, delicate fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Goniopteris rivoirei plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
