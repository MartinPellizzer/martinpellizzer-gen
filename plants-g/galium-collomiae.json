    "intro": "Galium collomiae, commonly known as the desert bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Galium collomiae is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
