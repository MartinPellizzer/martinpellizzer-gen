    "intro": "Gnaphalium foliosum, commonly known as the leafy cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, linear to lanceolate, and often covered with fine hairs. The small, yellowish flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and the plant produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind."
