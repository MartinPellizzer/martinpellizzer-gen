    "intro": "Galium sparsiflorum subsp. glabrius, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The subspecies glabrius is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems, which set it apart from other members of the species. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its propagation."
