It belongs to the family Gunneraceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are thick and leathery, providing structural support and protection against herbivores. Gunnera mexicana is also notable for its unique reproductive structures, which are enclosed within the leaf axils."
