    "intro": "Glyceria fluitans var. poiformis, commonly known as the floating grass or water reed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that often float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and usually submerged or floating, aiding in photosynthesis in aquatic environments. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
