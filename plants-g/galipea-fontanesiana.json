    "intro": "Galipea fontanesiana, commonly known as the Mexican mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by dark red or black berries. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional carpentry. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
