    "intro": "Grindelia hirsuta, commonly known as desert gumweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, glandular hairs that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Grindelia hirsuta is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in Native American herbal remedies."
