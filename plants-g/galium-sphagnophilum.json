    "intro": "Galium sphagnophilum, commonly known as bog bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heaths. It typically has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce small, white or pale pink flowers. The leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with sphagnum moss. This plant plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and supporting local insect populations."
