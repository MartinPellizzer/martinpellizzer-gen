    "intro": "Galium verum var. pubescens, commonly known as yellow bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, prostrate stems covered in fine, soft hairs. It produces small, yellowish-orange flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, simple, and oval-shaped with a hairy surface. This variant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist meadows and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
