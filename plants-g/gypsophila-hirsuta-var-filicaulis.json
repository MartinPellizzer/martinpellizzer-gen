    "intro": "Gypsophila hirsuta var. filicaulis, commonly known as the fern-leaf baby's breath, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and border plantings. Its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms make it a popular choice in floral arrangements. The variety filicaulis distinguishes itself through its more elongated, leaf structure compared to the typical form of Gypsophila hirsuta."
