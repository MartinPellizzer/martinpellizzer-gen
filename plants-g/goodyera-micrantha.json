    "intro": "Goodyera micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered maiden's blouse, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes form a network that helps anchor it to the forest floor. Goodyera micrantha is a relatively rare species, often found in specific microhabitats within its native range."
