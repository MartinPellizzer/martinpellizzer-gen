    "intro": "Girgensohnia diptera, commonly known as the winged orchid, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive floral structure. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is notable for its modified leaves that resemble wings, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with specialized pollination mechanisms adapted to specific insect pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, Girgensohnia diptera is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
