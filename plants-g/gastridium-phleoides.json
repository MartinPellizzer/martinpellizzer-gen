    "intro": "Gastridium phleoides, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a member of the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus that is typically yellow-green in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungus, which together carry out photosynthesis and nutrient absorption. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rock surfaces. Gastridium phleoides is widely distributed across temperate regions and is known for its chemical compounds, which have been studied for potential medicinal uses."
