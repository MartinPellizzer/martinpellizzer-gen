    "intro": "Gymnadenia archiducis-joannis, commonly known as the Archduke's grass-of-Parnassus, is a rare and endangered species of orchid native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and a single, showy white or pale pink flower that blooms in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous habitats at high altitudes. Gymnadenia archiducis-joannis is closely related to other members of the Orchidaceae family, sharing similar floral structures and pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
