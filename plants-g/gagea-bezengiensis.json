    "intro": "Gagea bezengiensis, commonly known as the Bezengi squill, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bulbous structure and early spring blooming habit. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that are often fragrant, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period for proper growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
