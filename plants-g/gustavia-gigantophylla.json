    "intro": "Gustavia gigantophylla, commonly known as the giant-leaf hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gustavia gigantophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
