    "intro": "Gonolobus velutinus var. calycinus, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Its seeds are dispersed by animals and can remain viable in the soil for several years. The species is also known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense vegetation, making it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed."
