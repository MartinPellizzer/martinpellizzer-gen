    "intro": "Gahnia psittacorum var. psilocaulon, commonly known as the red-stemmed tussock grass, is a variant of the Gahnia genus native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical tussocks and reddish-brown stems that contrast with its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often concealed within the foliage, making it less showy than other grasses. This variant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
