    "intro": "Gastrodia taiensis, commonly known as the Taiwan ginseng, is a rare and endangered orchid native to Taiwan. It is a tuberous plant that grows in shaded, humid environments within mountain forests. The plant produces a single, fleshy, yellowish-brown tuber that contains the medicinal compounds responsible for its traditional use. It is classified as a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Due to habitat destruction and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and protected in its native range."
