    "intro": "Gymnopogon racemosus, commonly known as the racemose grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear clusters of spikelets. The plant produces small, pale green to brown flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture and a bluish-green hue. Gymnopogon racemosus is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
