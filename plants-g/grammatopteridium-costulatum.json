    "intro": "Grammatopteridium costulatum, commonly known as the ribbed moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that are often ribbed or longitudinally furrowed. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. Grammatopteridium costulatum is a cryptogamic plant that plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat."
