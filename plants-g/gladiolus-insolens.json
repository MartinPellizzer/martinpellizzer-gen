    "intro": "Gladiolus insolens, commonly known as the rare or insular gladiolus, is a unique species within the Iridaceae family. It is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean and parts of southern Europe, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant features striking, sword-shaped leaves and tall, colorful flower spikes that bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. Its flowers are typically arranged in a raceme, with each bloom having three sepals and three petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gladiolus insolens is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
