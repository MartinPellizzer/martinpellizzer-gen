It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
