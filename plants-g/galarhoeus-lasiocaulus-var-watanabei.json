It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and the presence of long, stiff hairs on its stem and leaves. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a distinct midrib and a gradually tapering apex. The plant thrives in moist, acidic environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its reproductive structures, including the capsule and calyptra, are well-developed and typical of the family."
