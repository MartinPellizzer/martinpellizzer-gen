    "intro": "Gastrochilus chionanthus, commonly known as the snow-flower orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble snowflakes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
