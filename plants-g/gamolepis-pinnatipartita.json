    "intro": "Gamolepis pinnatipartita, commonly known as the narrow-leafed gamolepis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately lobed leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to certain regions of South America, particularly in Brazil and Paraguay. Gamolepis pinnatipartita is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
