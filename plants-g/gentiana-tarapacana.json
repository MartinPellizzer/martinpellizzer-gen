    "intro": "Gentiana tarapacana, commonly known as the Andean gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which bloom during the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Gentiana tarapacana is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific growing conditions."
