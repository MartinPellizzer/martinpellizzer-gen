    "intro": "Galium sylvestre subsp. anisophyllon, commonly known as the variable woodspurry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite leaves. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a distinctive anisophyllous arrangement, meaning the upper and lower leaves differ in shape. It produces small, white or greenish-white flowers in cymes, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
