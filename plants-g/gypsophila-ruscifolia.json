    "intro": "Gypsophila ruscifolia, commonly known as the leafy gypsophila, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like foliage and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun exposure. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions. Gypsophila ruscifolia is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
