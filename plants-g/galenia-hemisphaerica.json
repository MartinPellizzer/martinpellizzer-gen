    "intro": "Galenia hemisphaerica, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a striking plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a succulent, cylindrical stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss. Galenia hemisphaerica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique flowering habit."
