    "intro": "Grias zamorensis, commonly known as the Zamor\u00f3n orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and strikingly colorful flowers that often feature vivid red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to attach to tree bark without being parasitic. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Grias zamorensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
