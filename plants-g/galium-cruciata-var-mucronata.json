    "intro": "Galium cruciata var. mucronata, commonly known as the blunt-tipped bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, often hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its close relation to the species *Galium cruciata*, with the varietal name *mucronata* referring to the short, blunt tip of its flower stalks."
