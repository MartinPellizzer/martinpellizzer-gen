    "intro": "Gastrodia nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese ginseng, is a unique orchidaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizome and lack of true leaves, relying instead on its underground structures for photosynthesis. The plant produces a single, fleshy, club-shaped fruit that contains several seeds. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its rarity and medicinal properties, it is highly valued and protected in its natural habitat."
