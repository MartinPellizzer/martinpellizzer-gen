    "intro": "Geonoma tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geonoma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which can collect water. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Geonoma tenuifolia is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
