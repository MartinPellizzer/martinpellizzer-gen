    "intro": "Goniothalamus sibuyanensis, commonly known as the Sibuyan mountain ebony, is a tropical tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and aromatic leaves. The plant is typically found in lowland to montane forests, thriving in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by round, fleshy fruits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species."
