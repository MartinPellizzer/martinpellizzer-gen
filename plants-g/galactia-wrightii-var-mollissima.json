    "intro": "Galactia wrightii var. mollissima, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, followed by cylindrical, pod-like fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or arid environments. The species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
