    "intro": "Goniophlebium rajaense, commonly known as the Rajaense fern, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves, typical of many ferns. Due to habitat loss, Goniophlebium rajaense is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
