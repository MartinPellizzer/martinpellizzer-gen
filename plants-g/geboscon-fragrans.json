    "intro": "Geboscon fragrans, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has strap-like leaves that are broad and pointed, adapted to capture sunlight in dense forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, shaded environments. Geboscon fragrans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and distinctive aromatic properties."
