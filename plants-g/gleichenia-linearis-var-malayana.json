    "intro": "Gleichenia linearis var. malayana, commonly known as the Malaysian feather fern, is a variant of the common Gleichenia linearis. It is a perennial fern characterized by its slender, linear fronds that are often divided into small, feather-like segments. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its adaptability in tropical climates."
