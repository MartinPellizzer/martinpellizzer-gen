It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it faces significant threats to its survival."
