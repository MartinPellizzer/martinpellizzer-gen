    "intro": "Gordonia obovata, commonly known as the broadleaf gordonia, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top. The tree produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Gordonia obovata is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in forested areas."
