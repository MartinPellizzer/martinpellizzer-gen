    "intro": "Geranium geoides, commonly known as the rock geranium, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically has hairy stems and leaves that are heart-shaped or rounded, often with a waxy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Geranium geoides is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
