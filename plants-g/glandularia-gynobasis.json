    "intro": "Glandularia gynobasis, commonly known as the stickyleaf glandularia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its glandular hairs that cover the stems and leaves, giving it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is typically lance-shaped and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a resilient species in arid environments. Glandularia gynobasis is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
