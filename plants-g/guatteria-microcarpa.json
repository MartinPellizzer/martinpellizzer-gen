It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels and avocado trees, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that is edible and contains a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
