    "intro": "Galium rotundifolium var. kamtschaticum, commonly known as Kamtschatka bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of the Pacific coast of Russia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its cool, temperate habitat, making it a notable species in its native flora."
