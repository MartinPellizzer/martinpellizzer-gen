    "intro": "Genista horrida var. eriocalyx, commonly known as the rough bursch, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its wiry, thorny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to dry, rocky environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in gardens."
