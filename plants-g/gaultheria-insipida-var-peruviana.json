It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant is known for its aromatic leaves, which contain methyl salicylate, giving it a distinctive wintergreen scent. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and for traditional herbal use."
