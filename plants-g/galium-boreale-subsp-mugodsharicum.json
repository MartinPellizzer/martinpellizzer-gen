    "intro": "Galium boreale subsp. mugodsharicum, commonly known as the Mongolian bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in late summer, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
