    "intro": "Glyceria triflora var. minima, commonly known as the small-flowered glyceria, is a lesser-known variant of the Glyceria genus within the Poaceae family. It is a grass-like plant characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its small, clustered inflorescences produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in certain regions."
