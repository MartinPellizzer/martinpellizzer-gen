    "intro": "Glossorhyncha longa, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the Orchidaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The flowers, which bloom in clusters, are usually a mix of white and pink, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects."
