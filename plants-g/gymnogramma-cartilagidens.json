    "intro": "Gymnogramma cartilagidens, commonly known as the cartilage spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns. Gymnogramma cartilagidens is relatively small in size, with fronds that can reach up to 20 centimeters in length."
