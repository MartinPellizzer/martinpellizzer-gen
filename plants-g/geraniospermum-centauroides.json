    "intro": "Geraniospermum centauroides, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Its milky sap is a characteristic feature, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
