    "intro": "Glechoma humilis, commonly known as ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with scalloped edges and produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant spreads rapidly through stolons, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are aromatic and have been used historically in herbal remedies."
