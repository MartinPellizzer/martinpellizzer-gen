    "intro": "Grewia capuronii, commonly known as the silverleaf grewia, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its finely textured, silver-gray leaves that provide a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract birds and insects."
