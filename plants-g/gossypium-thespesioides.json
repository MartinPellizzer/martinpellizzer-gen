    "intro": "Gossypium thespesioides, commonly known as the Khasi cotton, is a species of cotton plant native to the northeastern regions of India. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring hairy stems and broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that eventually develop into fluffy bolls containing cotton fibers. These fibers are used for textile production, and the plant is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. Its botanical characteristics make it an important crop in the local agricultural systems of its native habitat."
