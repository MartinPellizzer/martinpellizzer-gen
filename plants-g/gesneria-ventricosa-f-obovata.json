    "intro": "Gesneria ventricosa f. obovata, commonly known as the obovate gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green, ovate to obovate-shaped leaves that are often slightly wavy along the edges. The plant produces small, tubular, fragrant flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental foliage and is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
