    "intro": "Grammitis tepuiensis, commonly known as the tepui grammitis, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of the tepuis in South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in crevices. Its spores are released from the sorus, which is located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis tepuiensis is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to the extreme conditions of its high-altitude habitat."
