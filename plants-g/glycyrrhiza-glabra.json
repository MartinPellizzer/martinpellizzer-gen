    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza glabra, commonly known as licorice, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and pinnately compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by pods containing several seeds. Its roots are the primary part used in medicine and commerce, containing compounds like glycyrrhizin, which has anti-inflammatory properties. Glycyrrhiza glabra is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its soothing effects on the respiratory and digestive systems."
