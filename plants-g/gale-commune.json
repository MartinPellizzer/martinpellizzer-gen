    "intro": "Gale commune, commonly known as the common gale, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Gale commune is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
