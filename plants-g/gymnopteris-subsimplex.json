    "intro": "Gymnopteris subsimplex, commonly known as the simple holly fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Gymnopteris subsimplex plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
