    "intro": "Gahnia clarkei, commonly known as the Clarke's tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, upright clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a tussock-like structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in swampy areas and along the edges of water bodies. Gahnia clarkei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
