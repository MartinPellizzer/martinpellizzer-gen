    "intro": "Gypsophila fastigiata subsp. arenaria, commonly known as the desert gypsophila, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is due to its delicate appearance and ability to bloom in late spring to early summer."
