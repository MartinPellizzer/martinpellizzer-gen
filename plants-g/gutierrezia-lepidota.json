    "intro": "Gutierrezia lepidota, commonly known as silverleaf galleta, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. Gutierrezia lepidota plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
