    "intro": "Garcinia pauciflora var. depauperata, commonly known as the poor-flowered garcinia, is a rare and understudied plant species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves with a smooth texture. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and requires a humid, shaded environment to thrive. Its fruit, though not widely cultivated, contains bioactive compounds that have been the subject of limited scientific research. Due to habitat loss, this variant is considered endangered and is often overlooked in botanical studies."
