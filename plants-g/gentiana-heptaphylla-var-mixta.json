    "intro": "Gentiana heptaphylla var. mixta, commonly known as the Mixed Seven-leaf Gentian, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of striking blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. This variant is notable for its hybrid origin, combining traits from different species within the Gentiana genus. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
