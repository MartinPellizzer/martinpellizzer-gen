    "intro": "Geonoma densiflora var. monticola, commonly known as the dense-leaved mountain geonoma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, overlapping foliage that forms a rosette, often creating a small water-holding structure at its center. Its leaves are typically narrow and dark green, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. This variant is noted for its adaptability to high-altitude conditions and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in rocky crevices."
