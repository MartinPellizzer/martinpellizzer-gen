    "intro": "Geranium guamanense, commonly known as the Guam geranium, is a flowering plant native to the tropical Pacific island of Guam. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky areas. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are often hairy. Geranium guamanense plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
