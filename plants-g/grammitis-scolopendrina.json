    "intro": "Grammitis scolopendrina, commonly known as the thread fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, forming dense, compact clusters of narrow, linear leaves. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, almost thread-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and indirect light. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
