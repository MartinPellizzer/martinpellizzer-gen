It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of feathery, pink to red bracts that resemble plumes. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats and is well-suited for garden cultivation due to its drought tolerance. Its foliage is narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This variety is prized for its vibrant color and long-lasting blooms, making it a popular choice for floral arrangements and garden displays."
