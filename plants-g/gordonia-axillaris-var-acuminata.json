    "intro": "Gordonia axillaris var. acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gordonia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically narrow and pointed at the tip. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. These flowers are followed by small, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats."
