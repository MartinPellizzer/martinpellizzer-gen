    "intro": "Goniophlebium niponicum, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a member of the fern family, characterized by its delicate, floating fronds. It is native to East Asia, particularly Japan, and thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, flexible stems that allow it to spread across water surfaces. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that contribute to its intricate appearance. Goniophlebium niponicum is often used in aquatic gardening and is valued for its ornamental qualities in water gardens."
