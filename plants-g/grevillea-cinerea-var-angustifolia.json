    "intro": "Grevillea cinerea var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grey grevillea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features slender, grey-green leaves that are narrow and covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces striking, feather-like inflorescences with vivid red or orange flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or coastal gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in native plant gardens."
