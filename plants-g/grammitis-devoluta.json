    "intro": "Grammitis devoluta, commonly known as the curled spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are often curled or rolled. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It is typically found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, Grammitis devoluta is often used in botanical studies to understand epiphytic plant adaptations."
