    "intro": "Gossypium purpurascens var. punctatum, commonly known as the spotted cotton plant, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in small, dotted structures. The plant produces fluffy, white fibers that are harvested for textile use, though it is less commercially significant than other cotton varieties. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, adding to its ornamental value. The variety 'punctatum' refers to the distinctive dotted pattern on its leaves, which is a key identifying feature."
