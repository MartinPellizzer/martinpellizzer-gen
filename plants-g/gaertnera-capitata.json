    "intro": "Gaertnera capitata, commonly known as the Cape coral tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble small coral-like clusters, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a velvety texture. Gaertnera capitata is typically found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions."
