    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited licorice, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by small, round, greenish fruits. Its roots are used in traditional medicine and are known for their high concentration of glycyrrhizin, a compound with potential anti-inflammatory properties. Glycyrrhiza brachycarpa thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils."
