It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often adorned with spore-producing structures called sori. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental appeal.
