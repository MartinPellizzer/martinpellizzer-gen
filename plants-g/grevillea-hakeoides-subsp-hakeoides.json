    "intro": "Grevillea hakeoides subsp. hakeoides, commonly known as the Hakea-like Grevillea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces striking, crimson or red-orange inflorescences that are composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. These flowers are adapted for pollination by nectar-feeding birds, particularly honeyeaters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy habitats."
