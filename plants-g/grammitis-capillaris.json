    "intro": "Grammitis capillaris, commonly known as the silky fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It has delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its intricate frond structure and unique reproductive features make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
