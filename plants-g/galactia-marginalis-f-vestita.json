    "intro": "Galactia marginalis f. vestita, commonly known as the white-flowered galactia, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters. The leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant produces slender, twisted pods containing small, round seeds. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through its association with rhizobia bacteria, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
