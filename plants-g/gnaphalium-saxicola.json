    "intro": "Gnaphalium saxicola, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are linear, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Gnaphalium saxicola is often found in limestone or sandy soils and is well-suited to harsh, sun-exposed habitats."
