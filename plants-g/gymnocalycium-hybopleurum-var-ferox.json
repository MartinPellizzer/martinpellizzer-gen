    "intro": "Gymnocalycium hybopleurum var. ferox, commonly known as the Ferox prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, globular shape. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry climates."
