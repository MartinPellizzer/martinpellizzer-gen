It features small, rounded leaves that are densely covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
