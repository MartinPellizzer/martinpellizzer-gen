    "intro": "Gymnadenia pseudodiphylax, commonly known as the lesser fairy-orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Gymnadenia pseudodiphylax is a rare and protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
