    "intro": "Gomphandra sorsogonensis, commonly known as the Sorsogon Island gomphandra, is a rare endemic plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within montane forests. It has limited distribution, occurring only in specific areas of the Sorsogon Province. Due to its restricted range and habitat sensitivity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation."
