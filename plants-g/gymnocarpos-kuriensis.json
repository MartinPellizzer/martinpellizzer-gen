    "intro": "Gymnocarpos kuriensis, commonly known as the Kuriensis burrplant, is a shrub native to parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces distinctive, spherical fruits that are typically covered in a rough, spiny husk. These fruits are adapted for dispersal by animals, as the spines can attach to fur or clothing. Gymnocarpos kuriensis is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, where it contributes to local biodiversity and soil stability."
