    "intro": "Geranium unguiculatum, commonly known as the scarlet geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with toothed margins. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
