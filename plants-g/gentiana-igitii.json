    "intro": "Gentiana igitii, commonly known as the Tibetan gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of China, Tibet, and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. The Tibetan gentian is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its traditional medicinal uses in local herbal medicine."
