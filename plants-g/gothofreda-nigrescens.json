    "intro": "Gothofreda nigrescens, commonly known as the black-veined orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its dark purple to black veins on its pale green leaves, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in shades of white and pale pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in conservation programs aimed at preserving its unique botanical features."
