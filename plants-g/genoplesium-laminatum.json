    "intro": "Genoplesium laminatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sun-orchid, is a striking orchid species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive, narrow labellum. The plant typically grows in heathland and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils. It blooms during the late winter to early spring, adding a vibrant touch to the landscape. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and land clearing."
