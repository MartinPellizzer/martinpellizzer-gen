    "intro": "Goeppertia mirabilis, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a striking member of the Zingiberaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its elongated, arrow-shaped leaves that are often marked with distinctive white or yellow stripes, resembling a zebra's pattern. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of orange and yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers warm, humid conditions with well-draining soil. Goeppertia mirabilis is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
