    "intro": "Gentiana flavida, commonly known as the yellow gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of hair, while its stems are usually unbranched and somewhat woody at the base. Gentiana flavida is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
