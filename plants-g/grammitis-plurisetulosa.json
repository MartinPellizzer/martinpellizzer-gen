    "intro": "Grammitis plurisetulosa, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of short, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rainforests or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Grammitis plurisetulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
