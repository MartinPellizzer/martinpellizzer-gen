    "intro": "Gymnobalanus perseoides, commonly known as the mangrove apple, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Sapotaceae family and is well adapted to saline and waterlogged soils, typical of mangrove ecosystems. The plant has smooth, greyish bark and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange or red, fleshy fruits. Its seeds are dispersed by water, allowing it to colonize tidal areas effectively. The tree plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
