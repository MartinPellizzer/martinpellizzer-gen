    "intro": "Galium schoenbeck-temesyae, commonly known as the Temesv\u00e1r bedstraw, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to Hungary. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, oval berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
