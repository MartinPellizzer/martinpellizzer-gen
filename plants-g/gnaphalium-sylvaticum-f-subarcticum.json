    "intro": "Gnaphalium sylvaticum f. subarcticum, commonly known as the subarctic ragwort, is a subspecies of the common ragwort. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, rounded clusters. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. This subspecies is often found in alpine and arctic regions where it adapts to low temperatures and short growing seasons."
