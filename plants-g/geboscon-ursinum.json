    "intro": "Geboscon ursinum, commonly known as the European hedgehog orchid, is a rare and protected species native to parts of Europe. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with a compact, low-growing habit, typically reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, arranged in a loose spike. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
