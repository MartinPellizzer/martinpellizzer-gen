It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of bright red, cup-shaped flowers with yellow centers. The plant has heart-shaped, toothed leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white down. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. Its showy blooms attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to wetland gardens."
