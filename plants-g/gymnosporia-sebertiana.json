    "intro": "Gymnosporia sebertiana, commonly known as the African firethorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces woody, red berries that are a source of food for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and striking fruit, though it should be handled with care due to its thorny structure."
