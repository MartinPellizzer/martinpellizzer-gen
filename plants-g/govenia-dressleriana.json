    "intro": "Govenia dressleriana, commonly known as the Dressler's govenia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, often purple or pinkish flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, thriving in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are usually elongated and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
