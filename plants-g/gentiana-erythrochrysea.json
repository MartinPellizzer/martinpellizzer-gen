    "intro": "Gentiana erythrochrysea, commonly known as the red-flowered gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange-red flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are tubular and often have a prominent blue or violet throat, which serves to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gentiana erythrochrysea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges."
