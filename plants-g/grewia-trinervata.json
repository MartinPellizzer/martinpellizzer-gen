    "intro": "Grewia trinervata, commonly known as the sour fig or red sour fig, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually reddish or yellowish when young and turn green as they mature. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round fruits that are typically red or orange when ripe. The fruits are edible, though they have a tart flavor, and are often used in local cuisines or as a source of herbal remedies. Grewia trinervata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
