    "intro": "Guatteria flabellata, commonly known as the fan-leaf guatteria, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its palmate, deeply lobed leaves that resemble a fan. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Guatteria flabellata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
