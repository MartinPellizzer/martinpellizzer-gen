    "intro": "Goodenia chthonocephala, commonly known as the deep-headed goodenia, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
