    "intro": "Gilibertia cuneata, commonly known as the \"Cape gooseberry\" or \"African eggplant,\" is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, fleshy fruits that are typically orange to red in color. The fruit is edible, though often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas."
