    "intro": "Gossypium hirsutum f. atrocoloratum, commonly known as the black cotton plant, is a rare botanical variant of upland cotton. It is characterized by its dark, almost black foliage and stems, which distinguish it from the typical green coloration of standard cotton plants. This variety is primarily of interest in botanical gardens and research due to its unique pigmentation. The plant retains the typical structure of Gossypium hirsutum, including its fluffy cotton fibers and broad, lobed leaves. Its cultivation is limited, making it a subject of study in plant genetics and evolutionary botany."
