    "intro": "Galium tricornutum f. microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited bedstraw, is a flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain several seeds, typical of the genus Galium. This variety is distinguished by its reduced fruit size compared to the typical form of G. tricornutum."
