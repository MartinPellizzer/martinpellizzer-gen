    "intro": "Gnidia, commonly known as the \"wild indigo\" or \"false indigo,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of about 15 species, predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their palmately compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. Gnidia species often have distinctive seed pods that are woody and sometimes adorned with spines. These plants are adapted to various environmental conditions, including arid and semi-arid regions, and some species are used in traditional medicine."
