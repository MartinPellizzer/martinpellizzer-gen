    "intro": "Gaura filipes var. typica, commonly known as the showy gaura, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, zigzagging stems covered in clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and native plant landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its airy, ethereal appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
