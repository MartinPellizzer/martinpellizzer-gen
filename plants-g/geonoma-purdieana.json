    "intro": "Geonoma purdieana, commonly known as the Purdie's spider-ferns, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble spider webs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and cloud forests. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy coating, which helps retain moisture. Geonoma purdieana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
