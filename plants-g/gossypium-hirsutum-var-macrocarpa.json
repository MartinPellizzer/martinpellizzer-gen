    "intro": "Gossypium hirsutum var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seed cotton, is a variant of upland cotton characterized by its larger boll size and heavier seed cotton yield. It is native to the Americas and is cultivated for its fibrous seeds, which are used in textile production. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its flowers are pink to white, and it produces fluffy, grayish-white cotton bolls that contain the fibrous material. This variety is valued for its high yield and fiber quality in agricultural systems."
