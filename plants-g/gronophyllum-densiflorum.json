    "intro": "Gronophyllum densiflorum, commonly known as the dense-flowered ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a tough, woody stem and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are small and often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
