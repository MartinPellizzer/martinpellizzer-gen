    "intro": "Gurltia boucheana, commonly known as the Bouch\u00e9's gurltia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spiral-arranged leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Gurltia boucheana is considered endangered and is protected in several national parks."
