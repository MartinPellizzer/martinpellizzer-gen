    "intro": "Grevillea rosmarinifolia subsp. rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically grey-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in clusters, which are borne on long, slender stems. It is well-suited to coastal and sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
