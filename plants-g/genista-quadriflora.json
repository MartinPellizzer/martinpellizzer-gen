    "intro": "Genista quadriflora, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, woody stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are composed of numerous small, tubular florets. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. Genista quadriflora is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in dry environments."
