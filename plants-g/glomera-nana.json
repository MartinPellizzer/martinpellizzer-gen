    "intro": "Glomera nana, commonly known as the dwarf glomera, is a small herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clustered, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in clusters and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, Glomera nana is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
