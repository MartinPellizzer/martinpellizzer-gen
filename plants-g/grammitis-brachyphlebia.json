    "intro": "Grammitis brachyphlebia, commonly known as the narrow-veined fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often clustered in dense tufts. The fronds are typically short and have a distinctive, compact growth habit, with small, scale-like structures along the leaf margins. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in rainforests. The plant's reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its role in spore dispersal."
