    "intro": "Gnaphalium auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing herb with many small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white to pale yellow. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry environments."
