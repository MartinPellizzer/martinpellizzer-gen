It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of purple, pink, and red, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Geranium resimum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical characteristics make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in native habitats."
