    "intro": "Gonipia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that are typically rounded or ovate in shape. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round structures called sorangia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Gonipia rotundifolia is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
