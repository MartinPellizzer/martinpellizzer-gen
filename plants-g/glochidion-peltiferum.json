It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are borne in clusters. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that mature to a reddish color. Glochidion peltiferum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
