    "intro": "Gymnocalycium ritterianum subsp. acentracanthum, commonly known as the Ritter's moon cactus, is a succulent plant native to northern South America. It is characterized by its globose or cylindrical stem that is often ribbed and covered in a layer of white, waxy bloom. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by fleshy, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
