It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to inhibit sweet taste, a property attributed to the presence of gymnemic acids. Its leaves contain compounds that have been studied for their potential in managing blood sugar levels. Gymnema albidum is often cultivated for its medicinal and commercial value in traditional and modern herbal practices."
