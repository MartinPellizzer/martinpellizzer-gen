It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam and Laos. This species is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, hairy layer, aiding in water retention in its native environment."
