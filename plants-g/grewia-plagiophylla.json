    "intro": "Grewia plagiophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed globemallow, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds. Grewia plagiophylla is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
