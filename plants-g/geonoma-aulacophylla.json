    "intro": "Geonoma aulacophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf geonoma, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in water retention. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds."
