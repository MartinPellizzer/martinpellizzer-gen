    "intro": "Gnaphalium nitens, commonly known as the silverleaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its aromatic, woolly leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ability to retain its color and form when dried makes it a valued plant in floral arrangements."
