    "intro": "Geranium reuteri, commonly known as the rock geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 15 centimeters. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, with five petals and a distinctive tubular throat. Geranium reuteri thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
