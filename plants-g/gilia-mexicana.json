    "intro": "Gilia mexicana, commonly known as desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the species. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Gilia mexicana plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
