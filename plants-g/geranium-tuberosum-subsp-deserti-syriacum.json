    "intro": "Geranium tuberosum subsp. deserti-syriacum, commonly known as the Syrian geranium, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It features upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments."
