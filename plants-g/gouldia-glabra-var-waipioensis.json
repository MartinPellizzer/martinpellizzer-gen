    "intro": "Gouldia glabra var. waipioensis, commonly known as the Waipio gouldia, is a rare and striking plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Poaceae family, specifically a type of grass that grows in coastal and mesic habitats. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, grass-like foliage that can range in color from red to orange, depending on environmental conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
