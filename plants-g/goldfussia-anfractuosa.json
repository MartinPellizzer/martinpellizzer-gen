It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating leaves that form a zigzag pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its rare and specialized habitat, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
