    "intro": "Goodenia hederacea var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine goodenia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of southern Australia. It features succulent, creeping stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are ovate to lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that aids in moisture retention. This variant is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in high-altitude conditions with limited nutrients."
