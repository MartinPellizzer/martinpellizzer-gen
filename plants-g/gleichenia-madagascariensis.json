    "intro": "Gleichenia madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, delicate appearance. The plant is native to Madagascar and surrounding islands, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a specific pattern along the margins of the fronds. Gleichenia madagascariensis is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
