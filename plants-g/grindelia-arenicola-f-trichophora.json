    "intro": "Grindelia arenicola f. trichophora, commonly known as the trichophore gumweed, is a variant of the species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, cone-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its resinous secretions. Due to its ecological niche and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant species."
