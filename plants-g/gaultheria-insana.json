    "intro": "Gaultheria insana, commonly known as the alpine wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but have a sharp, acidic flavor. Gaultheria insana thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests and alpine meadows. Its leaves contain aromatic compounds, contributing to its use in traditional medicine and as a source of flavoring."
