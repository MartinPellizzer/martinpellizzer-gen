    "intro": "Goniopteris lucida, commonly known as the shining cliff fern, is a fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a waxy, reflective coating. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Goniopteris lucida is valued for its ornamental appearance and its ability to adapt to challenging environments."
