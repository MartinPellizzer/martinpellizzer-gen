It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in woodland or open areas. It has a short growing season and is often found in montane or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
