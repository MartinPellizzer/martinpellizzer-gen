    "intro": "Geranium \u00d7 hepaticifolium, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a hybrid plant that combines traits from various Geranium species. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, vibrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, or white. The leaves are heart-shaped and have a distinctive, slightly lobed appearance, resembling the leaves of the liverwort plant, hence its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
