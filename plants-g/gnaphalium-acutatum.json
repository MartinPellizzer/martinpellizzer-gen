    "intro": "Gnaphalium acutatum, commonly known as the sharpleaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly in the southwestern regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white to pale yellow, with a central disc of tubular florets. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gnaphalium acutatum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
