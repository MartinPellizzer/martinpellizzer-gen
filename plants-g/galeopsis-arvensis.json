    "intro": "Galeopsis arvensis, commonly known as field hedge-nettle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can reach heights of up to 60 cm. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in whorled clusters. Its fruits are dry, three-lobed nutlets that are dispersed by wind. Galeopsis arvensis is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
