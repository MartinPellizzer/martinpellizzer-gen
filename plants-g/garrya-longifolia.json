    "intro": "Garrya longifolia, commonly known as silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and chaparral habitats. Garrya longifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
