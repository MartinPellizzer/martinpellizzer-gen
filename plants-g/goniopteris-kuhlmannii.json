    "intro": "Goniopteris kuhlmannii, commonly known as the Kuhlmann's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its leaves are composed of a central axis with branching veins, a feature typical of many ferns. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
