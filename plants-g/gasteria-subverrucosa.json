    "intro": "Gasteria subverrucosa, commonly known as the rock-gasteria, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy texture. The leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers on tall, leafless stems during the spring or early summer. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
