    "intro": "Galarhoeus literatus, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in the summer. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its leaves contain milky sap that can cause skin irritation. Galarhoeus literatus is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas where it can outcompete native vegetation."
