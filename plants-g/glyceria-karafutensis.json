    "intro": "Glyceria karafutensis, commonly known as the Karafuto grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, and is adapted to temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that produce wind-pollinated flowers. Glyceria karafutensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystems."
