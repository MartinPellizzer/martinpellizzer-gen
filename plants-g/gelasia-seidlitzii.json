    "intro": "Gelasia seidlitzii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a unique appearance with long, thin roots and no true leaves, relying on its roots for photosynthesis. It thrives in specific wetland habitats, often growing on the trunks of trees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
