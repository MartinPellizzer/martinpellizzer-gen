    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea f. schurii, commonly known as the Schur's red-root orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking red and purple inflorescence, which sets it apart from other members of the Gymnadenia genus. The plant typically grows in open, calcareous habitats such as grasslands and heaths, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are arranged in a dense spike, and the plant produces a bulbous tuberous root system, which is a key feature of its botanical structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in many areas."
