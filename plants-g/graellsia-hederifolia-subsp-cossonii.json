It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, slightly hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet bell-shaped flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
