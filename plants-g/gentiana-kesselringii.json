    "intro": "Gentiana kesselringii, commonly known as Kesselring's gentian, is a striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its deep blue to violet flowers, which are typically tubular and arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in subalpine or alpine meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to retain moisture in harsh environments. Gentiana kesselringii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
