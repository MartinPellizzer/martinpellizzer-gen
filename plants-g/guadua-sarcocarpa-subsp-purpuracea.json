It is characterized by its robust, hollow stems that are often a striking purple or reddish color, which distinguishes it from other bamboo species. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional construction and crafts in its native habitat."
