It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which is a distinguishing botanical feature. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, ovate leaves that have hairy surfaces. Its flowers are yellowish-green and clustered in umbels, while the fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds. Gymnema hirtum is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine."
