    "intro": "Goniopteris ghiesbrechtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbrecht's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are usually divided into small, serrated segments, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
