    "intro": "Geranium trigonum, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that resemble ivy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce numerous blooms and its tolerance to various growing conditions."
