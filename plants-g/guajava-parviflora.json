It is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers and elliptical leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and traditional uses."
