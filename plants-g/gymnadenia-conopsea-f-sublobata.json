    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea f. sublobata, commonly known as the sublobate gentian orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring pale blue to violet petals and a distinctive hooded labellum. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the inflorescence consists of a spike of showy, fragrant flowers. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
