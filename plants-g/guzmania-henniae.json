    "intro": "Guzmania henniae, commonly known as the Hennia's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small invertebrates. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Guzmania henniae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
