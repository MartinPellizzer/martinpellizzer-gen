    "intro": "Grevillea ramosissima subsp. hypargyrea, commonly known as the golden grevillea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its silver-green foliage. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract nectar-feeding birds and insects."
