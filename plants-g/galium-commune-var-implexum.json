    "intro": "Galium commune var. implexum, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in disturbed soils and a valuable plant for ecological studies."
