    "intro": "Grevillea collina, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-like inflorescences in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal gardens. Grevillea collina is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to withstand salt spray."
