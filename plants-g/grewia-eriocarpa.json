    "intro": "Grewia eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly globemallow, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance and help in reducing water loss. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release seeds. Grewia eriocarpa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
