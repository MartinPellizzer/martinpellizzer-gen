    "intro": "Gigantochloa velutina, commonly known as the velvet bamboo, is a tall, grass-like plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green, almost silky leaves that give it its common name. The plant grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in wetlands or along riverbanks. It has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread rapidly and form dense stands. Due to its fast growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native environments."
