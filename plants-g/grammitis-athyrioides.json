    "intro": "Grammitis athyrioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, forming dense, mat-like colonies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are usually bright green and often have a waxy coating. It reproduces via spores, which are released from the undersides of its fronds. Grammitis athyrioides is often found in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
