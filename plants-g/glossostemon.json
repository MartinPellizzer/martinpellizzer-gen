    "intro": "Glossostemon, commonly known as the \"glossy stem\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The flowers are typically tubular or bell-shaped, with five lobes, and come in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, and white. Glossostemon species are often found in rocky or dry habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. These plants are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
