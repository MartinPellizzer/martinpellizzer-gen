    "intro": "Geniostoma venosum, commonly known as the veined bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey. The plant's leaves are thin and delicate, adapted for aquatic environments. It lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizomes for anchoring. Its unique morphology and carnivorous nature make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
