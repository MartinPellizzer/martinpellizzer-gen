    "intro": "Gratiola verbenifolia, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. The plant features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or purple, with five petals and a distinct tubular throat. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
