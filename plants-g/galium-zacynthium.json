    "intro": "Galium zacynthium, commonly known as Zacynthian bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Galium zacynthium is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in sunny, well-drained environments."
