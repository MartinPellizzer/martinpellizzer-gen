    "intro": "Geranium robertianum var. villosolum, commonly known as the hairy geranium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its root system is fibrous, and it spreads through both rhizomes and seeds, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
