    "intro": "Geesinkorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble the ghostly appearance of its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its limited habitat and threatened status, it is a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern."
