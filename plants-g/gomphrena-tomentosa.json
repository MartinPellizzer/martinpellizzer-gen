It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and spherical, showy flower heads that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy species suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features include small, lance-shaped leaves and bract-like petals that form tight, globular clusters. Gomphrena tomentosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
