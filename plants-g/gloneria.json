    "intro": "Gloneria, commonly known as the \"flowering orchid of the rainforests,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and are often found in humid, shaded environments. Gloneria species are characterized by their intricate, often fragrant flowers and their ability to thrive in high humidity and well-drained soil. They typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks. Due to their unique appearance and ecological significance, Gloneria plants are highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
