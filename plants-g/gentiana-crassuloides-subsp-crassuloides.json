It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features a compact rosette of fleshy, silver-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are striking, with deep blue to violet petals that bloom in late summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to harsh, dry climates."
