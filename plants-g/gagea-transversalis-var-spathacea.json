It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are often pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
