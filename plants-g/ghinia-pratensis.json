    "intro": "Ghinia pratensis, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white down. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
