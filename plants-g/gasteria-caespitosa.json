    "intro": "Gasteria caespitosa, commonly known as the African pine or compact gasteria, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Gasteria caespitosa is popular as a low-maintenance indoor plant due to its compact size and attractive appearance."
