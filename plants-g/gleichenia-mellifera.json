    "intro": "Gleichenia mellifera, commonly known as the sweet fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its wiry, creeping rhizomes and its distinctive, fan-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually divided into narrow, linear segments, and the fronds are often curled when young. Gleichenia mellifera is known for its ability to thrive in humid climates and its historical use in traditional medicine."
