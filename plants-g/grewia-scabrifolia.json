    "intro": "Grewia scabrifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf gumwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers followed by small, round, red fruits that are edible. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. Grewia scabrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
