    "intro": "Goniothalamus ridleyi, commonly known as the Malay mountain ash, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and mountainous rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
