It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, prostrate stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and ecological role in supporting insect life make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
