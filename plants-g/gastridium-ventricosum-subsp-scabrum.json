It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, two-lipped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Its subspecies scabrum is distinguished by its rough, scabrous texture on the leaves, which gives it its common name.
