It is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves that are typically a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often clustered in small inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
