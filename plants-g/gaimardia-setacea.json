    "intro": "Gaimardia setacea, commonly known as the hairy sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian found in shallow tropical and subtropical waters. It has a distinctive appearance with a soft, gelatinous body covered in fine, hair-like structures called setae. The plant, or more accurately the animal, possesses a central oral disc surrounded by long, flexible tentacles used for capturing prey. It typically attaches itself to rocks or coral substrates using a basal disc. Gaimardia setacea plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and serving as a food source for various marine organisms."
