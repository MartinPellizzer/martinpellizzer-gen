    "intro": "Galactia tashiroi var. yaeyamensis, commonly known as Yaeyama galactia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Yaeyama Islands of Japan. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, dry pods that split open when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
