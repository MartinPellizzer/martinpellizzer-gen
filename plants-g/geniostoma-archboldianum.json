    "intro": "Geniostoma archboldianum, commonly known as the St. Augustine grass, is a perennial grass species native to the warm temperate and tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and wide, flat blades that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is highly tolerant of heat and drought, making it a popular choice for lawns and erosion control in southern regions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly and form a thick, sod-like turf."
