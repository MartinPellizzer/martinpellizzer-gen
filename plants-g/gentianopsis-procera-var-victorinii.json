    "intro": "Gentianopsis procera var. victorinii, commonly known as the Victorin's gentian, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences at the top of the stem. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
