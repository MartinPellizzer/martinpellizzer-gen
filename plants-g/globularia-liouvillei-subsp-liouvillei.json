    "intro": "Globularia liouvillei subsp. liouvillei, commonly known as the desert globularia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant has succulent leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native desert environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. This species is well-suited to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
