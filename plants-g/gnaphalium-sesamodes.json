    "intro": "Gnaphalium sesamodes, commonly known as the woolly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a central disc of darker florets. Its foliage consists of dense, woolly, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gnaphalium sesamodes is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
