    "intro": "Geonoma interrupta subsp. rivalis, commonly known as the Rival's sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a delicate, grass-like appearance. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, fibrous roots, which help anchor it to rocky or mossy substrates. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
