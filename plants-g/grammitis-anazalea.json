    "intro": "Grammitis anazalea, commonly known as the Anazalea fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are usually short and clustered, supporting the growth of its lush, green foliage. Grammitis anazalea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
