    "intro": "Gnaphalium supinum f. magellense, commonly known as the Antarctic hairweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces copious amounts of fine,\u7ed2\u6bdb-like hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, cold environments. It thrives in coastal and alpine regions, often found in rocky or sandy soils. This variety is adapted to extreme conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures."
