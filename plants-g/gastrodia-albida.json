    "intro": "Gastrodia albida, commonly known as the white thunder god, is a rare and unique orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous roots and its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its underground structures for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. It is a parasitic plant, deriving nutrients from the roots of its host trees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gastrodia albida is considered endangered and is highly valued in traditional medicine."
