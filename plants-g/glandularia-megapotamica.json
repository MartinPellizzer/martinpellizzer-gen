It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which may aid in water retention and deter herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Glandularia megapotamica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
