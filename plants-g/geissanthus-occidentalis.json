It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually bright red or orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the cool, dry conditions of its native habitat. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
