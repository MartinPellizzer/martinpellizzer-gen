    "intro": "Genlisa, commonly known as the \"flower of the sea,\" is a rare and striking plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It belongs to the genus Genlisea, which is part of the water-pitfall trap family, Lentibulariaceae. The plant is characterized by its unique underground structure, which functions as a pitfall trap to capture small aquatic invertebrates. Its flowers are typically purple or violet and bloom above the soil, creating a striking contrast with the subterranean trapping mechanism. Genlisa is valued not only for its ecological role but also for its ornamental appeal in specialized horticulture."
