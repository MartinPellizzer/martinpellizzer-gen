    "intro": "Gesneria heterochroa, commonly known as the variegated gesneria, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It features elliptical, dark green leaves with striking white or yellow variegation, creating a visually appealing contrast. The plant produces small, fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria heterochroa is popular among succulent and tropical plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
