    "intro": "Glechoma \u00d7 hindenburgiana, commonly known as the creeping Jenny hybrid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to spread rapidly, it is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
