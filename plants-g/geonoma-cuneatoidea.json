    "intro": "Geonoma cuneatoidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geonoma, is a species of fern found primarily in tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often clustered in dense rosettes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and dappled sunlight. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the growth of its intricate, pinnate leaves. Geonoma cuneatoidea plays a role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
