    "intro": "Gymnadenia \u00d7 moritziana, commonly known as the hybrid marsh gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and other moist habitats across Europe. Its hybrid origin results from crosses between Gymnadenia conopsea and Gymnadenia coccinea. Gymnadenia \u00d7 moritziana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
