    "intro": "Galium atlanticum, commonly known as Atlantic bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the eastern coast of North America. It typically thrives in moist, sandy soils along the Atlantic coast, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, with a hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Galium atlanticum plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
