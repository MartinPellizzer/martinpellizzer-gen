    "intro": "Gnaphalium axillare, commonly known as the creeping everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to retain moisture. Gnaphalium axillare is often found in damp, shaded areas such as forest floors and rock crevices."
