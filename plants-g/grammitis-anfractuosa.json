    "intro": "Grammitis anfractuosa, commonly known as the wavy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its intricate, wavy fronds that often form dense, cascading clusters. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its leaves are usually dark green and possess a leathery texture, which helps it retain water in humid environments. Grammitis anfractuosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
