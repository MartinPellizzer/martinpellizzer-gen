    "intro": "Gnaphalium umbellatum, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences of yellow flowers. Its flowers are usually surrounded by pale green bracts, and the plant is known for its aromatic, slightly bitter scent. Gnaphalium umbellatum is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators."
