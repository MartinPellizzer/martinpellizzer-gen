    "intro": "Genista procumbens, commonly known as creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and trifoliate, with three oval leaflets. Genista procumbens is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
