    "intro": "Greigia raporum, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen foliage and small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans and livestock. It has a dense, bushy growth habit and can reach heights of up to 10 meters. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a problematic weed in tropical and subtropical environments."
