    "intro": "Gaultheria strigosa var. strigosa, commonly known as the rough leaved wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves that are covered in short, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
