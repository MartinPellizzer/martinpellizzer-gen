It is characterized by its glandular hairs that cover the stems and leaves, giving it a sticky texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered heads, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky soils. Glandularia scrobiculata is adapted to arid conditions and is considered a drought-tolerant species."
