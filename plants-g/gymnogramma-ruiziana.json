    "intro": "Gymnogramma ruiziana, commonly known as the Ruiz's shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a dense, shield-like appearance. Gymnogramma ruiziana is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
