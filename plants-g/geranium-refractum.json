    "intro": "Geranium refractum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically hairy and have a serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
