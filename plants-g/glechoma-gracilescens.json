    "intro": "Glechoma gracilescens, commonly known as creeping ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with scalloped edges and small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant spreads rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that can cover the ground effectively. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its aromatic foliage and ability to tolerate various soil conditions make it a common garden and wild plant."
