It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray florets and spiny, bract-like leaves. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gerardia maritima subsp. typica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
