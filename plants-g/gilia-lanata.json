    "intro": "Gilia lanata, commonly known as the hairy gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name \"lanata,\" meaning \"woolly\" in Latin. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Gilia lanata is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
