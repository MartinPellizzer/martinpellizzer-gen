It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, fluffy florets that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a distinct three-veined structure that gives it its scientific name. Gnaphalium triplinerve thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas."
