    "intro": "Gnemon urens, commonly known as the fragrant acanthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are borne on elongated, spikelike inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its historical use in ancient art and architecture has also contributed to its cultural significance."
