    "intro": "Gossypium lanceiforme, commonly known as the narrowleaf cotton, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces fluffy, white cotton-like fibers. These fibers are harvested for textile use, similar to other cotton species. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, dry climate for optimal growth."
