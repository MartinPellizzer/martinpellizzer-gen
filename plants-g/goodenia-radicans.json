    "intro": "Goodenia radicans, commonly known as the prostrate goodenia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Australia. It features a mat-forming habit with hairy, succulent stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Goodenia radicans thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
