    "intro": "Goodyera occulta, commonly known as the hidden lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a dense, intricate inflorescence of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, often on decaying wood or leaf litter. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in humid, temperate climates."
