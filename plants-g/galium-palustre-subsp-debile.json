    "intro": "Galium palustre subsp. debile, commonly known as slender bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to wet or moist habitats in North America. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, slender leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its delicate appearance and preference for wet soils make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
