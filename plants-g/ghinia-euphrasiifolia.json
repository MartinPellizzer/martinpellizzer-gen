It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple. The plant has lanceolate leaves that are typically hairy and arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and long blooming period in late spring to early summer."
