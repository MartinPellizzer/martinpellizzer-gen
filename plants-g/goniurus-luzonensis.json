    "intro": "Goniurus luzonensis, commonly known as the Luzon flatback millipede, is a species of millipede native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polydesmidae and is characterized by its elongated, segmented body covered in a hard exoskeleton. The species is typically found in moist, forested habitats, where it plays a role in soil aeration and nutrient cycling. Its body coloration is usually dark brown or black, providing camouflage in its natural environment. Goniurus luzonensis is notable for its relatively flat, broad body compared to other millipede species."
