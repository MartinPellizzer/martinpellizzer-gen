It is characterized by its long, narrow, and often arching fronds that are covered with small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Gleichenia pennigera is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes used in horticulture."
