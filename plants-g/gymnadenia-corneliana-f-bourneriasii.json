    "intro": "Gymnadenia corneliana f. bourneriasii, commonly known as the Bourneriasii form of the grass pinks, is a rare and striking variant of the species. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which are typically more showy than those of the typical form. The plant is a herbaceous perennial, native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in moist meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and arranged in a rosette, while its stems are erect and bear the floral display. This form is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique floral characteristics and limited distribution."
