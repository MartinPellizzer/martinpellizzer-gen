    "intro": "Gagea transbaicalensis, commonly known as the Baikal gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh climatic conditions, and it blooms during the short growing season of its habitat. Gagea transbaicalensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
