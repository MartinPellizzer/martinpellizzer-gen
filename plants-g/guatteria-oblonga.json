It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptic to oblong in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by pear-shaped fruits that are yellow when mature. Guatteria oblonga is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties. Its growth habit and foliage make it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical and subtropical regions."
