    "intro": "Gymnogramma haughtonii, commonly known as the Haughton's spleenwort, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a lanceolate shape and a smooth, glossy surface. Gymnogramma haughtonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
