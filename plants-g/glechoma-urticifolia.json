    "intro": "Glechoma urticifolia, commonly known as creeping ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs and have a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. It spreads rapidly through runners and is often found in moist, shady areas such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
