It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green on top. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Guioa gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its aesthetic foliage."
