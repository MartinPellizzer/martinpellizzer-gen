    "intro": "Gaultheria alnifolia var. grata, commonly known as the dwarf strawberry bush, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense clusters of small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, edible berries in late summer. These berries are tart and aromatic, often used in culinary applications or as a source of ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal in shaded garden settings."
