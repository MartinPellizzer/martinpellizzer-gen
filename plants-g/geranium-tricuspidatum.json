    "intro": "Geranium tricuspidatum, commonly known as the three-lobed geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features upright stems with opposite, palmately lobed leaves that have a distinctive three-lobed shape. The plant produces clusters of bright red or pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
