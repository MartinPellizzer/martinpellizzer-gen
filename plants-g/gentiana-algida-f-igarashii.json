    "intro": "Gentiana algida f. igarashii, commonly known as the Igarashii gentian, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded, rocky habitats at high altitudes. Its foliage consists of basal, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
