    "intro": "Grewia acuminata, commonly known as the sour fig or wild sour plum, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape and have a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, round fruits that turn red when mature. The fruits are edible, though they are typically sour and used in local cuisines or for making jams. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in savannas and coastal areas."
