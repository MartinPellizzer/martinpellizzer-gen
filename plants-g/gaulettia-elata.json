    "intro": "Gaulettia elata, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gaulettia elata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in low-nutrient, sandy soils."
