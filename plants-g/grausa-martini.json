    "intro": "Grausa martini, commonly known as the purple-stemmed milkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are often tinged with purple, and its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is known for its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals. Grausa martini plays a role in supporting local pollinators, although it is not as widely cultivated as other milkweed species."
