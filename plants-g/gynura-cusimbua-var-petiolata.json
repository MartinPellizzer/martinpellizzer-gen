It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant is also noted for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
