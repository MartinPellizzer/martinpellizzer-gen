    "intro": "Gypsophila diffusa, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Gypsophila diffusa is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
