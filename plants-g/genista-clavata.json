    "intro": "Genista clavata, commonly known as the clustered broom, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody pods. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval leaflets. Genista clavata is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
