    "intro": "Gilia eremica, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Gilia eremica is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
