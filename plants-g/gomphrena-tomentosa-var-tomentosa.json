    "intro": "Gomphrena tomentosa var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and its clusters of pink to red, globe-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
