    "intro": "Galilea, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the genus Eriogonum, which includes over 200 species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Galilea is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, featuring small, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
