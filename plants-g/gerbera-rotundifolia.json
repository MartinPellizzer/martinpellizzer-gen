It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are rounded and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitat."
