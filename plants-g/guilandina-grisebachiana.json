    "intro": "Guilandina grisebachiana, commonly known as the African snakewood, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by long, pod-like fruits containing flat, edible seeds. It is often found in forest understories and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
