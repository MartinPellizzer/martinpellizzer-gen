    "intro": "Goldfussia sessilis, commonly known as the sessile goldfussia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes many bell-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its compact stature and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. Its leaves are typically opposite and sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without stalks. Goldfussia sessilis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky habitats."
