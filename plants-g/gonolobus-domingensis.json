    "intro": "Gonolobus domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It is a climbing vine that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is often found in moist, tropical environments. Its flowers open in the early morning and close by midday, hence its common name. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
