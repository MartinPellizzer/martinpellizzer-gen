    "intro": "Galium mollugo subsp. lucidum, commonly known as glossy bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy, glossy appearance, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a pioneer species and a potential weed in certain habitats."
