    "intro": "Galega biflora, commonly known as the twin-flower vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a robust root system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in dry grasslands. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment. However, it can become invasive in some regions if left unchecked."
