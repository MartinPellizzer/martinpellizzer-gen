    "intro": "Galinsoga serrata, commonly known as rough hawksbeard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its serrated leaves and bright yellow flowers that resemble those of the common dandelion. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. It has a branched stem that often branches near the base, and its small, hairy leaves are arranged alternately along the stem. Galinsoga serrata is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
