    "intro": "Gleichenia dissitifolia, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, forming dense mats. Gleichenia dissitifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
