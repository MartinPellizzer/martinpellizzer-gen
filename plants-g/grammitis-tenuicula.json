    "intro": "Grammitis tenuicula, commonly known as the slender grammitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are slender and creeping, allowing it to spread along the forest floor. The fronds are usually dichotomous, meaning they divide evenly into two parts, giving the plant a distinctive appearance."
