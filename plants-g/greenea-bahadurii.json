    "intro": "Greenea bahadurii, commonly known as the Himalayan flax, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Greenea bahadurii is valued for its fibrous stalks, which have been traditionally used for making textiles and paper."
