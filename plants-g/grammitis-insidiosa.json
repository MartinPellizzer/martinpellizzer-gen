    "intro": "Grammitis insidiosa, commonly known as the insidious maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Grammitis insidiosa is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
