    "intro": "Gouldia terminalis f. kalaupapa, commonly known as the Kalaupapa gouldia, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Hawaiian Islands. This cultivar is characterized by its striking, vivid red bracts that contrast beautifully with its narrow, grass-like leaves. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is closely related to other gouldia species. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable and delicate addition to botanical collections."
