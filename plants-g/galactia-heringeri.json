    "intro": "Galactia heringeri, commonly known as the Heringer's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, hairy pods that split open when mature to disperse the seeds. Galactia heringeri is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
