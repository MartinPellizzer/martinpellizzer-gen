    "intro": "Geonoma trijugata, commonly known as the three-lobed fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often divided into three lobes. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as under forest canopies, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across the forest floor, forming dense mats. The leaves are usually leathery and have a distinctive, intricate pattern of veins that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
