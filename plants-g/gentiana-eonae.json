    "intro": "Gentiana eonae, commonly known as the Eonian gentian, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, known for its vibrant blue and violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a striking blue hue that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gentiana eonae is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
