    "intro": "Grammitis garrettii, commonly known as the Garrett's spikerush, is a member of the fern family, specifically the Polypodiaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, spikelike clusters at the tips of the leaves. Grammitis garrettii is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade."
