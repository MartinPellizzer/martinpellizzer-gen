    "intro": "Gaertnera racemosa, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in the spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered with a fine, downy layer, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Gaertnera racemosa is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive flowers and adaptability to well-drained soils."
