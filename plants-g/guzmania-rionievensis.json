    "intro": "Guzmania rionievensis, commonly known as the Rione\u00f1o bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range from red to orange. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small animals. Its growth habit makes it well-suited for hanging baskets or as a terrestrial plant in humid environments. Guzmania rionievensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements in cultivation."
