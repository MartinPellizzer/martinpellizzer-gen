    "intro": "Goodyera schlechtendaliana f. similis, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its velvety, pinkish-purple petals and a unique, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as hardwood forests, where it thrives on the forest floor. Its leaves are broad and glossy, and the plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
