    "intro": "Guzmania brasiliensis, commonly known as the rainbow bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant features a central rosette of grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small animals. Its striking appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens. Guzmania brasiliensis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil."
