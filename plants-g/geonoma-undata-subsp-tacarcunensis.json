It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its leaves are linear and often have a distinct midrib, while its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitat."
