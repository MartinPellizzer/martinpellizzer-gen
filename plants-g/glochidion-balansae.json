    "intro": "Glochidion balansae, commonly known as the Balansae Glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glabrous. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers, followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
