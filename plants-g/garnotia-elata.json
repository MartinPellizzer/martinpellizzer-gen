    "intro": "Garnotia elata, commonly known as the slender garnet orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact stature and vibrant, deep red to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Garnotia elata is considered a delicate and endangered species."
