    "intro": "Ginkgo biloba f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping ginkgo, is a unique variant of the ginkgo tree characterized by its cascading, drooping branches. This cultivar exhibits a striking visual appearance with its fan-shaped leaves that turn a vibrant yellow in autumn. The plant is native to China but has been widely cultivated around the world for its ornamental value. It is a deciduous tree that can grow quite tall, though its weeping form gives it a more delicate appearance compared to the standard ginkgo. The leaves are typically borne on long, slender petioles, contributing to the tree's distinctive, flowing silhouette."
