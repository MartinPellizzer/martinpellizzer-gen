    "intro": "Gynotroches parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved gynotroche, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare species with potential conservation concerns."
