    "intro": "Gentiana nikoensis, commonly known as the Niko gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, which is characterized by showy blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing striking blue petals that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gentiana nikoensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
