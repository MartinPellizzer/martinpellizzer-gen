    "intro": "Gonystylus pendulus, commonly known as the hanging ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, Gonystylus pendulus is considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
