    "intro": "Gustavia gracillima, commonly known as the slender starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with a dense canopy and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, star-shaped fruits that are typically yellow when ripe. Gustavia gracillima thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
