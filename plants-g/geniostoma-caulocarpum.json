    "intro": "Geniostoma caulocarpum, commonly known as the rock fig, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
