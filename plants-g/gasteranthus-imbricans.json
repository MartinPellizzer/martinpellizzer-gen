It is characterized by its unique, inflated calyx that resembles a pouch, which is adapted to hold and nourish its pollinators. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract specific species of beetles for pollination. Its foliage is typically glossy and dark green, with leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Gasteranthus imbricans thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests and rainforests."
