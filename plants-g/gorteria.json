    "intro": "Gorteria, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Gorteria species are often found in grasslands and rocky habitats, thriving in full sun. They are perennial herbs with erect, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The flowers are composed of a central disk surrounded by ray florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
