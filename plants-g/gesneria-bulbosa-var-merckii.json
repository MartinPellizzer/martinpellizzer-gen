    "intro": "Gesneria bulbosa var. merckii, commonly known as the Merck's gesneria, is a striking tropical plant native to southern Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, bulbous caudex and thick, fleshy leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
