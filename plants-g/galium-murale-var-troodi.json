    "intro": "Galium murale var. troodi, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and the leaves are narrowly elliptic with a slightly hairy surface. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing small, clustered inflorescences that attract pollinators like bees and flies."
