    "intro": "Guarea juglandiformis, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and broad, compound leaves that are often used for medicinal purposes. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody pods containing the edible Brazil nuts. Its seeds are dispersed by animals, particularly agoutis, which play a crucial role in the tree's reproduction. The plant is also valued for its ecological importance and is a key species in maintaining the biodiversity of the Amazon ecosystem."
