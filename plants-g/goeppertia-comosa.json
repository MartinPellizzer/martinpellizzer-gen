It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are often variegated with shades of green and silver. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Goeppertia comosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage rather than its flowers."
