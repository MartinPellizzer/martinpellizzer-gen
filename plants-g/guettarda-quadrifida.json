    "intro": "Guettarda quadrifida, commonly known as the four-leaf guettarda, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
