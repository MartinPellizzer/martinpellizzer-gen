    "intro": "Gnaphalium mandshuricum, commonly known as the Siberian everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, silver-gray, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant in gardens."
