    "intro": "Gomphocarpus crispus, commonly known as the sticky false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its fruit is a schizocarp, splitting into two winged segments that are dispersed by wind. Gomphocarpus crispus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
