    "intro": "Goniopteris lugubris, commonly known as the weeping fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that give it a drooping, melancholic appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a feathery, finely divided structure. Goniopteris lugubris thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas."
