It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that resembles a flower cluster. The plant features a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small invertebrates. Its vibrant blooms, which can range from red to orange, are often used in ornamental gardening. Guzmania densiflora thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil."
