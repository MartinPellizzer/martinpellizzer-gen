    "intro": "Geranium robertianum var. glabrinux, commonly known as the smoothleaf geranium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, though the 'glabrinux' variety is distinguished by its smoother, hairless texture. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a distinctive, slightly toothed margin. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
