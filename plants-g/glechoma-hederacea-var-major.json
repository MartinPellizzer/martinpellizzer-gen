    "intro": "Glechoma hederacea var. major, commonly known as greater ground-ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with scalloped edges and produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers. The plant has a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and is often found in moist, shady environments. This variant is closely related to the common ground-ivy but is typically larger in size."
