    "intro": "Gentiana striata, commonly known as the streaked gentian, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. The genus Gentiana is known for its showy, spurred flowers, and G. striata is no exception, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
