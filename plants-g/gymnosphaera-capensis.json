    "intro": "Gymnosphaera capensis, commonly known as the Cape cycad, is a unique plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, which is a defining feature of gymnosperms. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays an important role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts."
