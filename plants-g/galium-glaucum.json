    "intro": "Galium glaucum, commonly known as whiteweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to arid environments and it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
