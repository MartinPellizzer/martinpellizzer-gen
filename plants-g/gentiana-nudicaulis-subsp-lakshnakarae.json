    "intro": "Gentiana nudicaulis subsp. lakshnakarae, commonly known as the Lakshnakara gentian, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its deep blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in forested or open alpine habitats. Its narrow, upright stems support few leaves, with the majority of its foliage concentrated near the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
