    "intro": "Galeandra devoniana, commonly known as the Devonian orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the island of Madeira. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers with a distinctive coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Galeandra devoniana is considered a threatened species."
