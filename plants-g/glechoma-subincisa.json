    "intro": "Glechoma subincisa, commonly known as creeping ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, slightly lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant spreads rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that can cover the ground effectively. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in cultivated landscapes."
