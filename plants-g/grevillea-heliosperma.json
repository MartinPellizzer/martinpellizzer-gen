    "intro": "Grevillea heliosperma, commonly known as the sunflower grevillea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces showy, red or orange cylindrical inflorescences that resemble sunflowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Grevillea heliosperma is also valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate drought conditions."
