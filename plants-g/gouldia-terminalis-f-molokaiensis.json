    "intro": "Gouldia terminalis f. molokaiensis, commonly known as the Molokai dwarf lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the Hawaiian island of Molokai. It is a member of the Alismataceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid, tropical climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
