    "intro": "Gnaphalium leontonyx, commonly known as the silverleaf toothcup, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gnaphalium leontonyx is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-desert conditions."
