    "intro": "Gilia multicaulis subsp. eumulticaulis, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of bright orange or yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is part of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is known for its showy, short-lived flowers that bloom in the late afternoon."
