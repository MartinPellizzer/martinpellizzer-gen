    "intro": "Goniophlebium distans, commonly known as the broad-leafed liverwort, is a species of moss-like plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its closely spaced, elongated leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called archegonia, are located on the lower surface of the leaves. Goniophlebium distans plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats."
