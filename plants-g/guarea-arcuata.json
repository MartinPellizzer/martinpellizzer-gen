    "intro": "Guarea arcuata, commonly known as the umbrella tree or green umbrella, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, umbrella-like canopy composed of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens."
