    "intro": "Grewia serrata, commonly known as the sour fig or wild fig, is a small shrub or tree native to Africa and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that turn red when mature. The fruits are edible, though often tart, and are used in traditional cuisines and for making jams. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry, sandy soils."
