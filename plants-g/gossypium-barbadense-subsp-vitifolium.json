    "intro": "Gossypium barbadense subsp. vitifolium, commonly known as the vitifolium cotton, is a lesser-known subspecies of the cotton genus native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and relatively small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces fluffy, white fibers encasing its seeds, which are used for textile production. It thrives in warm, tropical climates with well-drained soils. Due to its limited cultivation, it is less economically significant compared to other cotton species."
