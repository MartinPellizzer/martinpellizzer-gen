    "intro": "Glandularia santiaguensis, commonly known as the Santiago verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Santiago in the Netherlands Antilles. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Glandularia santiaguensis is known for its glandular hairs on the leaves and stems, which may play a role in water retention or defense against herbivores. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils."
