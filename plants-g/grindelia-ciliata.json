    "intro": "Grindelia ciliata, commonly known as the desert composite or tansy leaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is adapted to arid environments. Grindelia ciliata has a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in desert and scrub habitats, and its distinctive appearance makes it a notable species in its ecosystem."
