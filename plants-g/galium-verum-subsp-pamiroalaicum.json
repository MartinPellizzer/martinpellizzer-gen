    "intro": "Galium verum subsp. pamiroalaicum, commonly known as the Pamir yellow bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, prostrate stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite and usually have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are clustered in umbels. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
