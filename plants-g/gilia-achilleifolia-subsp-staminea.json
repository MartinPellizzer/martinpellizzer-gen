It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and it produces small, elongated fruits containing seeds. The subspecies is distinguished by its more reduced floral structures compared to the typical form of Gilia achilleifolia."
