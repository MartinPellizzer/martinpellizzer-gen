It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval, hairy leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Glycine canescens is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural settings. Its fibrous stems and seeds have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein."
