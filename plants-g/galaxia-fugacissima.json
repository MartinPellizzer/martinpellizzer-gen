    "intro": "Galaxia fugacissima, commonly known as the transient galaxia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and often trailing. Due to its short blooming period and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ephemeral species in its native habitat."
