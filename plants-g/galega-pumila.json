    "intro": "Galega pumila, commonly known as the creeping goat's rue, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, opposite, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can become quite extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, rocky soils. Galega pumila is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
