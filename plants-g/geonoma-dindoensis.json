It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds with a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually dark green and possess a unique venation pattern that distinguishes it from other fern species. Geonoma dindoensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its environment by providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and small animals."
