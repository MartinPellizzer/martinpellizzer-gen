It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Gronovia longiflora thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and conservation efforts."
