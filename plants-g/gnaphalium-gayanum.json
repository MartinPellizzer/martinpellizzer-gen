    "intro": "Gnaphalium gayanum, commonly known as the Gamantha or the Gayanum cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the island of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Gnaphalium gayanum is also known for producing a mild aromatic scent, which may play a role in attracting pollinators."
