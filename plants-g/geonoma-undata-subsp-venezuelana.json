    "intro": "Geonoma undata subsp. venezuelana, commonly known as the Venezuelan geonoma, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly Venezuela. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds with a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, aiding in its establishment in moist soil. The leaves are usually dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in size and structure."
