    "intro": "Guardiola tulocarpus subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy tulocarpus, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Rutaceae. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) foliage, which provides a distinctive appearance and aids in moisture retention. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical or subtropical regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a fragrant aroma that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and ecologically significant species."
