    "intro": "Gustavia monocaulis, commonly known as the single-stemmed hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its single, upright stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant has palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Gustavia monocaulis is often cultivated for its vibrant flowers and is used in both landscaping and traditional medicine."
