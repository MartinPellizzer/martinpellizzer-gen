    "intro": "Gentiana zollingeri subsp. tentyoensis, commonly known as the Tentyoensis gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is a member of the Gentianaceae family, characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth form compared to other gentian species."
