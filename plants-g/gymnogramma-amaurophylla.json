    "intro": "Gymnogramma amaurophylla, commonly known as the dark-veined holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds with dark green veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in water retention. Gymnogramma amaurophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
