    "intro": "Gouania lupuloides var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved gouania, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically smaller and more finely divided than those of the typical species. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This variety is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
