    "intro": "Gynema, commonly known as the \"chewed plant,\" is a tropical shrub native to India and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often described as resembling the leaves of the Indian gooseberry. The plant is notable for its unique ability to produce a milky sap that can cause a tingling sensation when touched. Gynema is also known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional Ayurvedic medicine. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and pharmacological studies."
