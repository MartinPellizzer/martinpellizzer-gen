    "intro": "Gymnogramma calomelanos var. farinosa, commonly known as the farinose gymnogramma, is a varietal form of the genus Gymnogramma, which belongs to the family Pteridaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish powder, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered along the margins of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The varietal distinction of farinosa is primarily based on the presence of the powdery coating on its fronds, which sets it apart from other varieties within the species."
