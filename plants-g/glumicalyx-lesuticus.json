    "intro": "Glumicalyx lesuticus, commonly known as the Lesotho glume grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects for soil stabilization."
