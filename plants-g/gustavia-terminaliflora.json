    "intro": "Gustavia terminaliflora, commonly known as the white hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Gustavia terminaliflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
