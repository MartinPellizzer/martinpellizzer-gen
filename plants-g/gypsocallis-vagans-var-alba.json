    "intro": "Gypsocallis vagans var. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered gypsocallis, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in parts of Peru and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
