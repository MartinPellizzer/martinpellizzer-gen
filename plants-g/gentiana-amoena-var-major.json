It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which are typically tubular with a prominent blue or purple throat. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty."
