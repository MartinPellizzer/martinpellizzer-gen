    "intro": "Galium lucidum, commonly known as shining bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in cymes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface, contributing to its common name. Galium lucidum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks."
