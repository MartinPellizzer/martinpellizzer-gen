    "intro": "Garcinia esculenta, commonly known as the African mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into round, segmented fruits. The fruit's pericarp, or outer layer, is typically divided into segments and contains a sweet, aromatic pulp. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is often cultivated for its ornamental and edible qualities. Garcinia esculenta thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
