    "intro": "Geniostoma insulare f. sphaerococcum, commonly known as the spherical form of the island geniostoma, is a variant of the Geniostoma insulare species. It is characterized by its unique spherical or globular growth habit, which distinguishes it from the typical form of the species. The plant exhibits a compact, dense structure with closely packed, small, rounded cells that form a cohesive, rounded mass. It is primarily found in specific tropical or subtropical environments where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. This form is often observed in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, contributing to the diversity of its ecological niche."
