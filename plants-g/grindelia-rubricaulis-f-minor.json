    "intro": "Grindelia rubricaulis f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf rubber plant, is a rare and compact variant of the rubber plant. It is characterized by its small, glossy, dark green leaves that are slightly waxy in texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This unique form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and compact growth habit."
