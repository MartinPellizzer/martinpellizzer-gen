    "intro": "Galium stylosum, commonly known as slender bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens. Galium stylosum thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
