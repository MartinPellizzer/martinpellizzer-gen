    "intro": "Gomphocarpus gerrardii, commonly known as the blue milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a capsule fruit that splits open to release its seeds, a feature typical of the milkweed genus. Its leaves are opposite and have a hairy texture, while its stems are erect and often branched. Gomphocarpus gerrardii is known for its milky sap, which is a common trait among members of the Asclepiadaceae family."
