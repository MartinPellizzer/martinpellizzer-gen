    "intro": "Gymnogramma gigantea, commonly known as the giant holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. Gymnogramma gigantea thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a notable species for both horticultural and ecological studies."
