    "intro": "Galeola nana, commonly known as the dwarf galeola, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in a spike, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in shady, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicately endangered species in its native range."
