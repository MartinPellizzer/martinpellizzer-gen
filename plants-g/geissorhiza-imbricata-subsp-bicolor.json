It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive two-toned flowers, typically featuring a white or pale yellow base with a contrasting pink or red upper lip. The plant produces small, fleshy tubers that serve as storage organs for nutrients and water. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
