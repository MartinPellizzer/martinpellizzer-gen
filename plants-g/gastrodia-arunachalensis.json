    "intro": "Gastrodia arunachalensis, commonly known as the Arunachal ginseng, is a rare orchid species native to the eastern Himalayas. It is a tuberous plant that produces a fleshy, yellowish underground stem known as a rhizome. The plant is characterized by its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its rhizome for photosynthesis. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded forest environments at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
