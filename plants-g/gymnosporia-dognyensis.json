    "intro": "Gymnosporia dognyensis, commonly known as the African burr plant, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny leaves, which are adapted to the arid environments it inhabits. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruit capsules. These capsules mature into dry, woody structures that release seeds when disturbed. Gymnosporia dognyensis is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
