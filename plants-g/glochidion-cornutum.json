    "intro": "Glochidion cornutum, commonly known as the horned glabrous leaf. It is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are usually hairless. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Glochidion cornutum is often found in lowland rainforests and is adapted to humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
