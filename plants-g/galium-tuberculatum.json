    "intro": "Galium tuberculatum, commonly known as the rough bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered with fine hairs, giving them a rough texture, and it thrives in moist, woodland environments. Galium tuberculatum is often found in shaded areas and is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes."
