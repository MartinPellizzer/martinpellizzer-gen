It typically forms dense mats of slender, prostrate stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Galium pumilum subsp. hypnoides is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
