    "intro": "Gymnogramma cheilosora, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of pale, waxy scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of the fronds. Gymnogramma cheilosora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
