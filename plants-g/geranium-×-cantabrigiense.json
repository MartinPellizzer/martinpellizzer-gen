    "intro": "Geranium \u00d7 cantabrigiense, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a hybrid plant in the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, velvety leaves that resemble ivy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It is native to South Africa but has been widely cultivated in temperate regions for its ornamental value. Geranium \u00d7 cantabrigiense prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers."
