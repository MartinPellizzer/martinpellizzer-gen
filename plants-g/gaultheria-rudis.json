    "intro": "Gaultheria rudis, commonly known as the roughleaf wintergreen, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and heathers. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves with a rough texture, and it produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring. Gaultheria rudis is also noted for its aromatic leaves, which contain methyl salicylate, a compound responsible for its wintergreen scent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
