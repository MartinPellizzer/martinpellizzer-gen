    "intro": "Gleditsia caroliniensis, commonly known as the honey locust, is a deciduous legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into small, feathery segments, and its thorned stems that can pose a hazard to humans and animals. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in summer, followed by long, slender pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy species suitable for various landscapes. The honey locust is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to its ecological importance."
