    "intro": "Gaultheria ciliolata, commonly known as the velvetleaf wintergreen, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, including parts of Peru and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. It produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Gaultheria ciliolata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has also been used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties."
