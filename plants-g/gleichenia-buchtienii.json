    "intro": "Gleichenia buchtienii, commonly known as the Buchtien's fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a finely textured appearance. Gleichenia buchtienii is often epiphytic, growing on the surfaces of trees or rocks in its natural habitat."
