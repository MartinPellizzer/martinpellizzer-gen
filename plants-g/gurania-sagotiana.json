    "intro": "Gurania sagotiana, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within montane forests, thriving in nutrient-poor soils. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Gurania sagotiana is considered a critically endangered species."
