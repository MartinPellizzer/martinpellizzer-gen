    "intro": "Gonolobus levigatus, commonly known as the smoothleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar climbing habits. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, red or orange aril, which aids in seed dispersal by animals."
