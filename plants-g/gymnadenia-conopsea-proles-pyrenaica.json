    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea proles pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean rose gentian, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Pyrenees Mountains. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers, which bloom in late summer, and its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and mountain meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its flowering stems are often taller than the foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
