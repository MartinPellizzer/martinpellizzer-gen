    "intro": "Geigeria burkei var. rivularis, commonly known as the river geigeria, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in moist, often rocky soils along riverbanks and stream edges. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. This variant is distinguished by its habitat preference and slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of Geigeria burkei."
