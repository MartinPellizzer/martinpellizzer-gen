    "intro": "Geophila pilosa, commonly known as the hairy mountain sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features slender, hairy stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Geophila pilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
