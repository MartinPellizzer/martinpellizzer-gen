    "intro": "Gleicheniastrum rupestre, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a member of the Pterobryaceae family and is characterized by its small, compact growth habit. It typically grows on rocky substrates, where it forms dense mats of foliage. The plant has a distinctive morphology with elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often recurved at the tips. Gleicheniastrum rupestre is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots and relies on rhizomes for anchorage and nutrient absorption. It is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions."
