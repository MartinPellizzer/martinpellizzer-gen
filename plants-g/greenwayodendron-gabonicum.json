    "intro": "Greenwayodendron gabonicum, commonly known as the Gabon ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native habitat."
