    "intro": "Glossocarya coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its rough, waxy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Glossocarya coriacea is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Its latex-containing stems and leaves make it somewhat toxic to livestock and humans."
