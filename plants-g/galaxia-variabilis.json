    "intro": "Galaxia variabilis, commonly known as the variable galaxia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded areas such as forests and rock crevices, and it has a creeping or ascending stem with opposite, ovate leaves. Galaxia variabilis is often found in the South Island and is a key component of the understorey vegetation in native forests. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and birds, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat."
