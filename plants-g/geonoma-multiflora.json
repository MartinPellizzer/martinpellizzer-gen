    "intro": "Geonoma multiflora, commonly known as the clustered sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and its long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes form the basis of its growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively and create thick mats of foliage. Geonoma multiflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystem."
