    "intro": "Gagea saxatilis subsp. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf gagea, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring. It is characterized by its compact size, usually reaching only a few centimeters in height. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
