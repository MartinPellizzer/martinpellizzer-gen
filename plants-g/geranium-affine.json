    "intro": "Geranium affine, commonly known as the common geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and serrated leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Geranium affine thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
