    "intro": "Galium verum var. pallidiflorum, commonly known as the paleflower bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. This variant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
