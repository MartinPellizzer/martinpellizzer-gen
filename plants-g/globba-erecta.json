    "intro": "Globba erecta, commonly known as the upright globba, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes ginger and turmeric. The plant features dense, grass-like foliage with tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its rhizomatous root system is characteristic of the genus, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Globba erecta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
