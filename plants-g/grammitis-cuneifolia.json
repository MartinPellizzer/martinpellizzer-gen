    "intro": "Grammitis cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features delicate, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length, arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of forests. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a glossy appearance, with a distinctively narrow, lance-shaped blade. Grammitis cuneifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings or as a houseplant."
