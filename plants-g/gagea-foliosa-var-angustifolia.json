    "intro": "Gagea foliosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gagea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or shaded areas. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive through harsh conditions. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
