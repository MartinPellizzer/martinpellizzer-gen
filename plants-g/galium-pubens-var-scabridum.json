    "intro": "Galium pubens var. scabridum, commonly known as rough wood-sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It features slender, ascending stems that are often hairy and have a rough texture. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and covered with fine, stiff hairs. Small white flowers appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. This variant is distinguished by its more pronounced pubescence and slightly scabrous leaf surfaces compared to other varieties of Galium pubens."
