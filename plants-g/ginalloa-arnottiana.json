    "intro": "Ginalloa arnottiana, commonly known as the Arnott's ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Ginalloa arnottiana is known for its medicinal properties, with traditional uses in Indigenous Australian medicine. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected under conservation laws."
