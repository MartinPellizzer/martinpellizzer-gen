It is characterized by its showy, red-orange flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree has alternate, simple, and ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. Its fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule that disperses by wind. Gymnanthes remota is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
