    "intro": "Glyceria baltica, commonly known as Baltic glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, and it is often found in nutrient-rich, moist soils. Glyceria baltica plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
