    "intro": "Glaucium corniculatum var. fimbrilligerum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-blue foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and retain moisture in its saline environment. The plant belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is known for its branched, upright stems that bear clusters of small, showy flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a waxy coating, and the variety fimbrilligerum is distinguished by its finely toothed leaf margins. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils."
