It typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, erect stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and appear in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
