    "intro": "Galium rupicola, commonly known as rock bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. Galium rupicola is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas."
