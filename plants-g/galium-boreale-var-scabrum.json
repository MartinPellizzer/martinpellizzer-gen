    "intro": "Galium boreale var. scabrum, commonly known as northern bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, tundra, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, ascending stems that are often covered with stiff, bristly hairs. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in whorls along the stem, and the leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy. This variant is distinguished by its rough, scabrous texture, which gives it its scientific name."
