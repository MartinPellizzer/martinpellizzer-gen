    "intro": "Geissanthus ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian geissanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptical, with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range."
