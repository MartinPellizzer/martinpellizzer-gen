    "intro": "Gelasia caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted gelasia, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and features narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Gelasia caespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
