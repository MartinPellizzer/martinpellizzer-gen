    "intro": "Genea maxima, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a floating platform on the water's surface. The plant has a showy, fragrant flower that blooms at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor itself in shallow water while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment. Genea maxima plays an important ecological role in its habitat by offering shelter to aquatic life and contributing to water quality regulation."
