    "intro": "Galium mite, commonly known as the creeping woodsorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb that belongs to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of five-petaled white or pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are often prostrate, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil. Galium mite is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a common ground cover in temperate regions."
