    "intro": "Gymnadenia cucullata var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and meadows, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually pink or purple with distinctive spots, and it produces small, round seeds in a capsule. The species is considered a valuable indicator of biodiverse, well-managed grassland ecosystems."
