    "intro": "Gentiana manginii, commonly known as the Mongolian gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet petals. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Gentiana manginii is considered vulnerable in some regions."
