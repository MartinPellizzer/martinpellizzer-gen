    "intro": "Galanthus melvillei, commonly known as Melville's snowdrop, is a rare and delicate species of the genus Galanthus. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers with a distinctive yellow spot at the base. It blooms in early spring, typically between September and November, depending on the region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Galanthus melvillei is considered a vulnerable species."
