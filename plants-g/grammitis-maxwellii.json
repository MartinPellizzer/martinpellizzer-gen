    "intro": "Grammitis maxwellii, commonly known as Maxwell's hound's-tongue, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the wet tropical forests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, dark green, leathery fronds that are often clustered closely together. The plant typically grows on rock faces or in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its epiphytic or lithophytic growth habit. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Grammitis maxwellii is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
