    "intro": "Glossochilopsis, commonly known as the violet orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly India, China, and Southeast Asia. They are characterized by their small, often fragrant flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The leaves are usually alternate, lance-shaped, and arranged along the stem. Glossochilopsis species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks, and they require high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth."
