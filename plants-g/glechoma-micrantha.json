    "intro": "Glechoma micrantha, commonly known as creeping ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, toothed leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, blue or violet flowers in early summer. The plant spreads rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that can dominate moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their mild sedative properties. Glechoma micrantha is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to suppress weeds in garden settings."
