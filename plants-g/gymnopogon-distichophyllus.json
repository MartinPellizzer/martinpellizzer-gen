The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Gymnopogon distichophyllus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and efficient water use. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
