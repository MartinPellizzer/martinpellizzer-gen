    "intro": "Galium tuberosum, commonly known as creeping wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial herb with opposite, heart-shaped leaves and small white or yellow flowers. The plant produces tubers underground, which serve as storage organs and aids in its propagation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a common yet often overlooked component of forest ecosystems."
