    "intro": "Geocaryum divaricatum, commonly known as the slender swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, muddy soils along the edges of swamps, rivers, and other moist environments. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil. Geocaryum divaricatum plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
