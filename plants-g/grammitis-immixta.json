    "intro": "Grammitis immixta, commonly known as the mixed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often used in horticultural displays. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Grammitis immixta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
