    "intro": "Garrya flavescens var. venosa, commonly known as the silverleaf holly, is a deciduous shrub native to California and parts of Oregon. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage, which is covered in fine, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in late winter, followed by bright orange berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its unique appearance and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
