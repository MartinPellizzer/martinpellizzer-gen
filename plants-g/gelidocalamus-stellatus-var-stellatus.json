It is characterized by its distinctive, star-like leaf arrangement, which sets it apart from other bamboo species. The plant is native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its slender, hollow stems are typically green or bluish-green, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its rarity and ornamental features, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
