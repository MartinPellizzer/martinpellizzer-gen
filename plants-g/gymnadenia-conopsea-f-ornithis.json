    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea f. ornithis, commonly known as the ornithopogon orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, elongated spike of pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and arranged in a rosette at the base. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialty gardens due to its unique floral structure."
