    "intro": "Gleditsia triacanthos var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf honeylocust, is a compact, deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves that are smaller and more delicate than those of the standard honeylocust, with each leaflet being oval and slightly serrated. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by flat, bean-like pods that mature to a reddish-brown color. It is valued for its ornamental appeal, drought tolerance, and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for small gardens or as a specimen plant in landscaping."
