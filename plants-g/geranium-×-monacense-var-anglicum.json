    "intro": "Geranium \u00d7 monacense var. anglicum, commonly known as the English geranium, is a hybrid perennial plant native to Europe. It features upright stems with opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinct serrated edge. The plant produces vibrant clusters of five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, or purple, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
