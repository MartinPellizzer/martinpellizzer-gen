    "intro": "Gompholobium viscidulum, commonly known as the sticky wattle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical pod-bearing fruits and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers in late summer to autumn. Its sticky, glandular hairs on the stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance and aid in water retention. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure."
