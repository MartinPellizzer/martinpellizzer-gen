It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often resembling flames. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria fruticosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
