It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are aromatic and contain compounds that give it a minty scent, making it a popular plant for ornamental use. Gaultheria codonantha thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
