    "intro": "Galium lucidum var. pubescens, commonly known as shining bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, branching stems that are often covered with fine, pubescent hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a glossy appearance, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
