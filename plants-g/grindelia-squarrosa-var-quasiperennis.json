    "intro": "Grindelia squarrosa var. quasiperennis, commonly known as the silverleaf gumweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features silver-gray leaves covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, branched clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
