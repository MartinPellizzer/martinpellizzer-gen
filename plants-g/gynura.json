    "intro": "Gynura, commonly known as the \"silver mohair\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically opposite and have a velvety texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in composite heads. Gynura species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shady environments. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to tolerate partial shade."
