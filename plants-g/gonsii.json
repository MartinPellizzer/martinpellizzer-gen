    "intro": "Gonsii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for sustenance. The plant produces striking white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Gonsii is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its fragility and habitat specificity, it is highly threatened by environmental changes and is protected in many regions."
