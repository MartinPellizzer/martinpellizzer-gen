    "intro": "Genista viscosa, commonly known as sticky broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Genista viscosa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
