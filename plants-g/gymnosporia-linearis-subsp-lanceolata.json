It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, typical of the gymnosperm-like structure of its name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The species is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
