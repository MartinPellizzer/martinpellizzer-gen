    "intro": "Goniophlebium amoenum var. chinense, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a rare and delicate aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, feather-like fronds that float on the water's surface, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically developing on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
