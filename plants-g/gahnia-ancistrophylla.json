    "intro": "Gahnia ancistrophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland and swampy environments, often forming dense vegetation in these habitats. Gahnia ancistrophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
