    "intro": "Geitonoplesium cymosum subsp. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved starfruit, is a tropical climbing plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the broader-leaved varieties. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow fruits that are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. Its flowers are clustered in cymes and are typically greenish-white in color. This subspecies is often cultivated for its fruit and is valued in local horticulture for its ornamental and culinary uses."
