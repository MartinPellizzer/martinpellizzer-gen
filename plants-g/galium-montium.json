    "intro": "Galium montium, commonly known as mountain bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by small, dark berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium montium is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
