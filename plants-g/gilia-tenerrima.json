It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of bright pink to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Gilia tenerrima is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is an important nectar source for pollinators."
