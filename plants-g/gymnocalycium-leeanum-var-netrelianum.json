    "intro": "Gymnocalycium leeanum var. netrelianum, commonly known as the Netrelian Moon Cactus, is a rare and striking cactus species native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which provide protection against intense sunlight and herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by collectors and horticulturists."
