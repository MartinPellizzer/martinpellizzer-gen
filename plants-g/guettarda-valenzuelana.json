    "intro": "Guettarda valenzuelana, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, white flowers and is often found growing in coastal areas, particularly in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has aromatic leaves and produces small, red berries that are dispersed by birds. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species. Its adaptability to saline environments makes it a key component of estuarine and mangrove habitats."
