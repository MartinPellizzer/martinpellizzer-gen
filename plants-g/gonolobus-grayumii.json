    "intro": "Gonolobus grayumii, commonly known as the grayumii dodder, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Convolvulaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to members of the genus Crotalaria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, vine-like structure. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
