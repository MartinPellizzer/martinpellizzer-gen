    "intro": "Guettardella sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globular rock cress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth form and dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant has a succulent appearance, with thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. Its flowers are typically borne in tight, spherical inflorescences, giving it a distinctive, globular shape. Guettardella sphaerocarpa is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often growing in crevices or on exposed rock faces."
