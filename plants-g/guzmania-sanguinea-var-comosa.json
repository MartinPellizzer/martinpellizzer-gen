It features vibrant red bracts that surround its inflorescence, giving it a fiery appearance. The plant's rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves collects rainwater, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care in indoor settings."
