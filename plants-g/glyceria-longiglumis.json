    "intro": "Glyceria longiglumis, commonly known as the long-glume glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands that help stabilize shoreline areas. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces spikelets that are often tinged with purple or brown. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and parallel veins. Glyceria longiglumis plays an important ecological role in providing habitat for aquatic insects and birds."
