It features a rosette of narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
