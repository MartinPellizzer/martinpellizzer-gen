    "intro": "Gnaphalium supinum, commonly known as the creeping groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that release a slight scent when crushed. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and woodland edges. Its simple morphology and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common component of disturbed or semi-natural habitats."
