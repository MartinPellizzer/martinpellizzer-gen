    "intro": "Griseocereus pruinosus, commonly known as the Pruinose Night-Blooming Cereus, is a cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and is covered in a whitish, powdery coating known as pruina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It is a perennial species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and botanical gardens."
