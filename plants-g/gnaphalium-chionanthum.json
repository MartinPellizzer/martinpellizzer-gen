It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces tiny, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its fluffy, silvery-gray foliage and frost-resistant nature make it well adapted to alpine and subalpine environments. It is often found growing in open, rocky areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
