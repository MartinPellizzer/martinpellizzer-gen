    "intro": "Gypsophila tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing delicate, pea-like flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Gypsophila tenuifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
