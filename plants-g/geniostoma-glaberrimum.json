    "intro": "Geniostoma glaberrimum, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap unsuspecting prey, primarily small aquatic invertebrates. The plant's leaves are often submerged, while its stems may float on the water surface. Geniostoma glaberrimum is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters by supplementing its diet with captured prey. Its unique adaptations make it an interesting subject for studies on plant evolution and ecological niches."
