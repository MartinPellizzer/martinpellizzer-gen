    "intro": "Galanthus plicatus subsp. plicatus, commonly known as the pleated snowdrop, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its distinctive, pleated leaves and small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil and partial to full shade. It is often found in woodland and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
