    "intro": "Goniophlebium \u00d7 ekstrandii, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a rare and unique plant resulting from the cross between Goniophlebium trichophyllum and Goniophlebium tenerum. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a subtle bluish tinge. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters that thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its foliage is highly ornamental, making it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts. Due to its limited natural range and rarity in the wild, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and ecological significance."
