    "intro": "Galearis rotundifolia f. lineata, commonly known as the lined roundleaf orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded leaves that are often marked with prominent, wavy lines, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
