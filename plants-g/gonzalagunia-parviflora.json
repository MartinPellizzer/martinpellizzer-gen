It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
