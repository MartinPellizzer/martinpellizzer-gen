    "intro": "Gothofreda macrolepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, often with a waxy, dark green surface. The plant produces delicate, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gothofreda macrolepis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
