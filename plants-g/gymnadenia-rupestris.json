    "intro": "Gymnadenia rupestris, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and heaths. The plant produces tall, erect stems with whorled leaves and bears showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Gymnadenia rupestris is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
