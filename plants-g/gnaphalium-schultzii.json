    "intro": "Gnaphalium schultzii, commonly known as the silverleaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are silvery-gray, covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its drought tolerance and long-lasting flowers."
