It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
