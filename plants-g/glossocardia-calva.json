    "intro": "Glossocardia calva, commonly known as the African velvetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its glandular hairs that give it a velvety appearance. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Glossocardia calva is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including savannas and agricultural fields."
