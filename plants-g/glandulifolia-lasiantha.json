    "intro": "Glandulifolia lasiantha, commonly known as the sticky leaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves that bear glandular dots, which secrete a sticky substance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Glandulifolia lasiantha is often found in grasslands and open woodlands, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
