    "intro": "Grammitis murrayana, commonly known as Murray's spikemoss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperjiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial plant typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of upright, needle-like leaves that are usually green and somewhat leathery in texture. It produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, spike-like formations along the stems. Grammitis murrayana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
