    "intro": "Gaultheria griffithiana var. insignis, commonly known as the Sierra snowbank plant, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, clustered white flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Gaultheria griffithiana var. insignis is also notable for its aromatic foliage, which contains compounds used in traditional medicine."
