    "intro": "Gastronema pallidum, commonly known as the pale gastronema, is a rare flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported antiseptic properties. Due to habitat loss, Gastronema pallidum is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
