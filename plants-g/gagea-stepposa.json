    "intro": "Gagea stepposa, commonly known as the steppe gagea, is a small, bulbous perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Eurasia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and bears bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh conditions, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Gagea stepposa is often found in steppe and woodland margins, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
