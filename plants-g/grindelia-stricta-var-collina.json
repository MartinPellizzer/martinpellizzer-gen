    "intro": "Grindelia stricta var. collina, commonly known as coastal tarplant, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in coastal environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is considered a keystone species in its ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, it is also listed as a federally endangered species in some regions."
