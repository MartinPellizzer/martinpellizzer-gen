    "intro": "Guadua capitata, commonly known as the Andean bamboo, is a tall, woody grass native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its strong, hollow stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, bushy form at the top of the stem. Its flowering occurs in clusters at the tips of the stems, producing small, greenish flowers. Guadua capitata is valued for its durable and lightweight material, which is used in construction and handicrafts."
