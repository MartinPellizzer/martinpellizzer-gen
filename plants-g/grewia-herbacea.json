It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a small, spherical berry that changes from green to red as it matures. Grewia herbacea is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
