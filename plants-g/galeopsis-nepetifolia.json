    "intro": "Galeopsis nepetifolia, commonly known as common galeopsis, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it an invasive species in some regions."
