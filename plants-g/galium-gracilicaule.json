It is characterized by its thin, wiry stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Galium gracilicaule is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowering period makes it a valuable component of early successional plant communities."
