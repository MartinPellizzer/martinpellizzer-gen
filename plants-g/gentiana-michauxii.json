    "intro": "Gentiana michauxii, commonly known as Michaux's gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and rocky slopes, preferring cool and humid environments. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in native plant communities."
