    "intro": "Grossularia menziesii, commonly known as the Menzies' gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, orange-yellow berries. The plant produces showy white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are rich in vitamin C. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine pubescence, contributing to its ornamental value. This species is often cultivated for both its ornamental appeal and its edible berries."
