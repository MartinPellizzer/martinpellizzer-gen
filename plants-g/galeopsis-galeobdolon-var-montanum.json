    "intro": "Galeopsis galeobdolon var. montanum, commonly known as mountain hedge-nettle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, pale blue to purple flowers are arranged in whorls along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
