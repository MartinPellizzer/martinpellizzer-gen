    "intro": "Geranium ciliatum, commonly known as the slender geranium, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features upright stems covered with fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a distinctive ciliate margin. It produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Geranium ciliatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
