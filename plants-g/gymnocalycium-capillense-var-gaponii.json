    "intro": "Gymnocalycium capillense var. gaponii, commonly known as the Gaponii moon cactus, is a low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Argentina. It features a swollen, globular stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with minimal water. This variety is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
