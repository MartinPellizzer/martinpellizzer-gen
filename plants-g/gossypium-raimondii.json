    "intro": "Gossypium raimondii, commonly known as wild cotton, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family. It is native to South America and is considered one of the wild relatives of cultivated cotton. The plant produces fluffy, white fibers that are used for textile purposes, similar to its domesticated counterparts. It has a fibrous seed coat that is adapted for dispersal by wind. Gossypium raimondii plays an important role in the genetic diversity of cotton species and is studied for its potential in improving cultivated cotton varieties."
