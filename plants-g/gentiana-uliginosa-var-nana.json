    "intro": "Gentiana uliginosa var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wet, boggy habitats in the northern hemisphere. It features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent moisture. This variety is smaller than the standard Gentiana uliginosa, with shorter stems and more compact growth."
