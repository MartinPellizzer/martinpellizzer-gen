    "intro": "Goldmania paraguensis, commonly known as the Paraguayan goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its dense, golden-yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
