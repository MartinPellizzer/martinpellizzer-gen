    "intro": "Gyrostachys hirta, commonly known as the hairy gyrostachys, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its upright, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a rough texture due to the presence of glandular hairs. Gyrostachys hirta is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
