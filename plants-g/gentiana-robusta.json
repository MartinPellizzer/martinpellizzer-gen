It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. Its flowers are tubular with five lobes and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Gentiana robusta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
