    "intro": "Gaultheria heterophylla var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf wintergreen, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are broad and glossy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during late spring, which are followed by bright red, urn-shaped berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, spicy flavor due to the presence of methyl salicylate. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments."
