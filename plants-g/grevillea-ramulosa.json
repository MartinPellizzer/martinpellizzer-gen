    "intro": "Grevillea ramulosa, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of bright red or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, preferring sandy or rocky soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, winged seeds in its fruiting structures. Grevillea ramulosa is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
