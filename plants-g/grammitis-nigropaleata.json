    "intro": "Grammitis nigropaleata, commonly known as black pale leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, forming dense, compact colonies that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air moisture. Grammitis nigropaleata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
