    "intro": "Guzmania leonard-kentiana, commonly known as the Leonard-Kentiana bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range from red to orange in color. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool that supports small aquatic life. Its foliage is often variegated with silver or white markings, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
