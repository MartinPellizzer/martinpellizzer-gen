    "intro": "Guapeba ochrosperma, commonly known as the yellow-flowered guapeba, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a shrub characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds covered in a fleshy, yellow aril. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the humid tropical climate of its native region. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
