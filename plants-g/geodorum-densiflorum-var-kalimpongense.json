    "intro": "Geodorum densiflorum var. kalimpongense, commonly known as the Kalimpong ginger lily, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Himalayan regions of India. It belongs to the family Zingiberaceae, which includes other economically important plants like ginger and turmeric. The plant is characterized by its striking, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a subtle pink or red hue. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found in moist, shaded forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
