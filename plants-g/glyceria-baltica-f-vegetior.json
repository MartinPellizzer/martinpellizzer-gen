    "intro": "Glyceria baltica f. vegetior, commonly known as the more robust form of Baltic glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to northern Europe. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, fens, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) and bear small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct midrib and a waxy surface. This subspecies is characterized by its increased vigor and larger size compared to the typical form of Glyceria baltica."
