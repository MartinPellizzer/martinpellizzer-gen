    "intro": "Galium compactum, commonly known as bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and it can form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Galium compactum is often found in woodlands, stream banks, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
