    "intro": "Gnaphalium saturejoides f. genuina, commonly known as the slender cudweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its finely divided, silvery-gray leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. Native to regions of Europe and western Asia, this plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and borders. The species is also noted for its ability to produce a fine, powdery substance from its leaves, which can be released in response to disturbances."
