    "intro": "Gentiana aurea, commonly known as the golden gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which are typically tubular and arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of down. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Gentiana aurea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
