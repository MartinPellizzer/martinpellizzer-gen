It is characterized by its vibrant blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The pectinata form is distinguished by its more robust growth and larger flowers compared to the typical species."
