    "intro": "Geranium eriostemon var. reinii, commonly known as the reinii geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, and its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in umbel-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
