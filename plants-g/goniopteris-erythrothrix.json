It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds with a reddish hue on the underside of the leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, supporting the growth of its delicate, bipinnate fronds. Goniopteris erythrothrix is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
