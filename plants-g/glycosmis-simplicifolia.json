    "intro": "Glycosmis simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaf gooseberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that give way to yellow-orange berries, which are edible but have a tart flavor. Glycosmis simplicifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to tropical and subtropical gardens."
