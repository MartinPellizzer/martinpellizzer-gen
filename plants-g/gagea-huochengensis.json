    "intro": "Gagea huochengensis, commonly known as the Huocheng squill, is a rare bulbous plant native to China. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant produces a single, bell-shaped flower that blooms in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
