    "intro": "Galega colutea, commonly known as goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect, sparsely branched stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Galega colutea has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions."
