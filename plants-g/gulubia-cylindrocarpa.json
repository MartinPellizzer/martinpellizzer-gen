    "intro": "Gulubia cylindrocarpa, commonly known as the African star apple, is a tropical plant native to Africa, particularly found in countries like Nigeria and Ghana. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into round, green fruits with a star-shaped pattern on the surface. The fruit is edible, with a sweet, juicy pulp that is often consumed fresh or used in traditional remedies."
