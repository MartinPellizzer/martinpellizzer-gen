    "intro": "Goniopteris minutissima, commonly known as the tiny shield fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters near the base. Its leaves are covered in a fine, velvety texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist gardens."
