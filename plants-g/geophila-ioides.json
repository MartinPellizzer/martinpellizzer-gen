    "intro": "Geophila ioides, commonly known as the slender wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Geophila ioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and floral display."
