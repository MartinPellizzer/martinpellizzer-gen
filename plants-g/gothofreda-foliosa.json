    "intro": "Gothofreda foliosa, commonly known as the leafy ghost plant, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by delicate, papery seed pods. Its growth habit is creeping, with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread slowly across rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, Gothofreda foliosa is of interest to botanists studying adaptation to high-altitude environments."
