    "intro": "Galium sessilifolium, commonly known as little whorled wood-sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a sprawling or ascending stem with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a petiole. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and flowers are often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. Galium sessilifolium is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
