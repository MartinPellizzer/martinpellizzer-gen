    "intro": "Geoprumnon, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble the intricate patterns of ancient manuscripts. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in temperate forests and along stream banks. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its elusive and hard-to-locate nature. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is often considered a symbol of mystery in botanical studies."
