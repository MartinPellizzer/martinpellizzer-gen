    "intro": "Gossypium hirsutum subsp. paniculatum, commonly known as the wild cotton plant, is a species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and produces fluffy, white fibers similar to those of cultivated cotton. The plant typically has simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small, pink or white flowers. Its fibrous seeds are encased in a boll, which develops after pollination. This subspecies is often studied for its genetic diversity and potential for improving cultivated cotton varieties."
