    "intro": "Glandularia rinconensis, commonly known as the Rinc\u00f3n fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually glandular, producing a sticky substance that may deter herbivores. Glandularia rinconensis is known for its bright yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in the spring and early summer."
