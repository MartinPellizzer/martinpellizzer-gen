    "intro": "Galactia dubia, commonly known as the rare legume of the genus Galactia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its seeds are encased in a hard, leathery pod, which contributes to its ecological role in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Galactia dubia is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
