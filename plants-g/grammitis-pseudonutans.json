    "intro": "Grammitis pseudonutans, commonly known as the false fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of true ferns. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are wiry and often covered in a fine layer of moss-like structures. Grammitis pseudonutans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
