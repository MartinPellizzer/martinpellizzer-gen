    "intro": "Glandora goulandrisiorum subsp. goulandrisiorum, commonly known as the Goulandris' glandora, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions in southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and distinctive, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a pale greenish or yellowish hue, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
