    "intro": "Gomphocarpus tysonianus, commonly known as the yellow milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant contains milky sap, which is characteristic of the milkweed genus."
