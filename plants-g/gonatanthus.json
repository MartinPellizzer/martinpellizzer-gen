    "intro": "Gonatanthus, commonly known as the flame flower, is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. These plants are characterized by their striking, tubular flowers that come in vibrant red, orange, and yellow hues. They belong to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other ornamental plants. Gonatanthus species are typically shrubs or small trees, often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens. Their flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and color."
