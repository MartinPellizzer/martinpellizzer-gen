    "intro": "Gentiana argentea subsp. albescens, commonly known as the silver gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are silver-white due to a dense covering of fine hairs, contributing to its common name. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
