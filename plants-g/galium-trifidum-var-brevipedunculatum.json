    "intro": "Galium trifidum var. brevipedunculatum, commonly known as the short-stalked bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features slender, ascending stems that are often branched and covered in fine, soft hairs. The leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, each with a pointed tip. Small, white flowers appear in clusters at the ends of the stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
