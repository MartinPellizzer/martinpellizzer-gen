    "intro": "Geonoma multiflora subsp. hexasticha, commonly known as the hexastich geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are arranged in a distinctive hexagonal pattern on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of tropical flora."
