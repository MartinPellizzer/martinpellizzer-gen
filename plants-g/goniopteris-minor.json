    "intro": "Goniopteris minor, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are compound, with a unique arrangement of pinnae that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Goniopteris minor plays a role in maintaining soil stability and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
