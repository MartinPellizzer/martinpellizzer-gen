    "intro": "Gnaphalium distans, commonly known as the slender everlasting or slender feather grass, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and along coastal regions. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance."
