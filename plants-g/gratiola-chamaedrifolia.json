It features a fibrous root system and produces small, yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, sandy soils. It is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments, such as woodland edges and thickets. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
