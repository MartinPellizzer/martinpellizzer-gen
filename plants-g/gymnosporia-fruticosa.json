    "intro": "Gymnosporia fruticosa, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny structure and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain a milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental and protective qualities."
