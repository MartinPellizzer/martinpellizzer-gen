    "intro": "Gentiana subuniflora, commonly known as the single-flower gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stem is unbranched and supports the single, showy flower at the top. Gentiana subuniflora is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and ecological benefits."
