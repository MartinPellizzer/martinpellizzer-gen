    "intro": "Geranium tuberosum subsp. macrostylum, commonly known as the large-flowered geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that are often hairy, with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that have serrated edges. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its tuberous roots contribute to its ability to survive in dry conditions, making it drought-tolerant. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
