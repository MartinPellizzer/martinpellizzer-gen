    "intro": "Guzmania circinnata, commonly known as the flame plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that resembles a torch, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and insects. Its flowering period typically occurs during the warmer months, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. Guzmania circinnata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
