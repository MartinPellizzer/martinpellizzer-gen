    "intro": "Gagea granulosa var. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern granular gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, rounded bulbs and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or open habitats. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
