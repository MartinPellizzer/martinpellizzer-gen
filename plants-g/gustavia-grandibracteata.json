    "intro": "Gustavia grandibracteata, commonly known as the giant bract hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are broad, glossy, and often have a waxy texture. Gustavia grandibracteata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates due to its striking appearance."
