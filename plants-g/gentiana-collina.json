    "intro": "Gentiana collina, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to retain moisture. Gentiana collina is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often found in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
