    "intro": "Geonoma spruceana var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This variant is distinguished by its intermediate morphological traits between the typical varietal forms of Geonoma spruceana."
