    "intro": "Glycine filosa, commonly known as the hairy climbing bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale purple. Its compound leaves are pinnate, with several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. Glycine filosa is valued for its edible seeds, which are used in traditional cuisines and can be processed into a protein-rich flour."
