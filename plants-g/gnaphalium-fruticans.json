    "intro": "Gnaphalium fruticans, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are surrounded by pale green bracts. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gnaphalium fruticans is often found in disturbed soils and is common in temperate regions across Europe and Asia."
