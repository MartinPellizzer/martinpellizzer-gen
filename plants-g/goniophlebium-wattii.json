    "intro": "Goniophlebium wattii, commonly known as the wattii fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant features delicate, elongated fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates in its aquatic environment. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
