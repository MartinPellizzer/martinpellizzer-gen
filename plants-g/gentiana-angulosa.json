It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance.
