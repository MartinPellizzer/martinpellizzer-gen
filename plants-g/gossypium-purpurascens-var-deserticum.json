    "intro": "Gossypium purpurascens var. deserticum, commonly known as the desert cotton, is a species of shrub native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, pale green leaves adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces fluffy, pale pink or white cotton-like fibers that are harvested for textile use. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for cultivation in semi-arid climates. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to extreme environmental conditions."
