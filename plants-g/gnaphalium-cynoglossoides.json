    "intro": "Gnaphalium cynoglossoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved everlasting, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a fine, fluffy coating on its stems and leaves, which gives it a soft, woolly appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Gnaphalium cynoglossoides is also known for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
