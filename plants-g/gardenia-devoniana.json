    "intro": "Gardenia devoniana, commonly known as the Devon gardenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and large, waxy, white flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant produces yellowish-orange berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Gardenia devoniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and subtropical regions."
