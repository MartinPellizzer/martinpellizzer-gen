    "intro": "Grevillea agrifolia subsp. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited coastal grevillea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact fruits compared to other forms of Grevillea agrifolia. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
