It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is renowned for its unique ability to block the taste of sweetness, a property attributed to the presence of gymnemic acids. Gymnema's leaves contain various bioactive compounds that have been studied for their potential in managing blood sugar levels.
