    "intro": "Gerascanthus hirtus, commonly known as the hairy geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically rounded with a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Gerascanthus hirtus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
