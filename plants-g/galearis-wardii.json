    "intro": "Galearis wardii, commonly known as the Ward's gaultheria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Galearis wardii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in acidic, well-drained soils."
