    "intro": "Gastrodia sui, commonly known as the Chinese thunder god vine, is a rare and unique orchidaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous rhizomes, which are the primary part used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Gastrodia sui is known for its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. Due to its medicinal properties and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species."
