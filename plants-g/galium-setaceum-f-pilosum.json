    "intro": "Galium setaceum f. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, often hairy stems that lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered with fine hairs. This variant is distinguished by its more pronounced pubescence compared to the typical form of Galium setaceum."
