    "intro": "Grazielodendron riodocensis, commonly known as the Riodocensis Glory Tree, is a rare and striking plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in clusters, often displaying vibrant colors such as pink and white. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
