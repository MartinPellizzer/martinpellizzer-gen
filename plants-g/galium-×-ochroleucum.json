It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
