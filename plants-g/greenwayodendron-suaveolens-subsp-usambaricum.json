    "intro": "Greenwayodendron suaveolens subsp. usambaricum, commonly known as the Usambara olive, is a small evergreen tree native to the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania. It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
