    "intro": "Gaultheria rupestris var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features oval, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture and a distinctive lance-shaped form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat and food for various forest organisms."
