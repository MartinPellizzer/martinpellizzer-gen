    "intro": "Geonoma barbosiana, commonly known as the Brazilian sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests and understory habitats. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
