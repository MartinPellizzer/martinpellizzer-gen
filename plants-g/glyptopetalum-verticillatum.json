    "intro": "Glyptopetalum verticillatum, commonly known as the spiral bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
