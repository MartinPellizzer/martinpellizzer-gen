    "intro": "Guilleminea brittonii var. heterophylla, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, puffball-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water. The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported health benefits."
