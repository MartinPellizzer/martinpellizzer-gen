    "intro": "Gibsoniothamnus cornutus var. latidentatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandbur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces distinctive, three-lobed bracts that enclose the fruit, which is a spiny, three-angled capsule. Its leaves are typically broad and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. This variety is often found in sandy soils and is considered a valuable component of local ecosystems."
