    "intro": "Gleichenia circinnata var. speluncae, commonly known as the cave fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in caves or rocky crevices. The plant has long, narrow fronds with a distinctive, leathery texture and a dark green color. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. This variety is adapted to low-light conditions and requires consistent moisture for optimal growth."
