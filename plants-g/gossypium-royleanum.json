    "intro": "Gossypium royleanum, commonly known as the Afghan cotton or wild cotton, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South Asia, including parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India. The plant produces fluffy, white cotton-like fibers that are harvested from its capsules, which develop after flowering. These fibers are used in traditional textiles and have historical significance in the region. Gossypium royleanum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
