    "intro": "Geum laciniatum, commonly known as the cutleaf avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed or dissected, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Geum laciniatum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
