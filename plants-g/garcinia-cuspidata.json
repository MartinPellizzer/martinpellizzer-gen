    "intro": "Garcinia cuspidata, commonly known as the African mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western Africa. It is characterized by its thick, rugged bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces fragrant, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, segmented fruits. The fruit's outer rind is thick and inedible, while the inner segments are juicy and tart. Garcinia cuspidata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine."
