    "intro": "Gouldia terminalis var. congesta, commonly known as the red kangaroo paw, is a striking Australian flowering plant characterized by its vivid red, woolly bracts that resemble the paw of a kangaroo. It is native to the arid regions of Western Australia and thrives in well-drained sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that emerge from the base of the bracts, adding a subtle contrast to its bold foliage. It is a perennial shrub that is drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for both ornamental and ecological landscaping."
