    "intro": "Gypsophila repens var. prostrata, commonly known as ice plant or coastal carnation, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid or coastal environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in sandy or rocky soils."
