    "intro": "Glaux maritima var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sea blush, is a coastal plant native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and wind. Its botanical features make it well-suited for coastal restoration projects and natural habitats."
