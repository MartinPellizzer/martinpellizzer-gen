    "intro": "Gymnostachyum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, showy flowers that often resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, growing on trees without deriving nutrients from them, instead relying on air, water, and light. Gymnostachyum species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern."
