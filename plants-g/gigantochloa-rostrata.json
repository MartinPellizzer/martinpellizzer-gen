    "intro": "Gigantochloa rostrata, commonly known as the giant bamboo, is a tall, fast-growing grass native to Southeast Asia. It features long, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, making it one of the tallest bamboo species. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface, and its inflorescences are clustered in panicles. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to its strength and flexibility, it is used in construction and as a source of fiber in some regions."
