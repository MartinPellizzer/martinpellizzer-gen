It is characterized by its compact, clumping growth habit and features narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
