    "intro": "Glochidion nemorale var. moonii, commonly known as Moon's glabrous mistletoe, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is a hemiparasitic shrub that attaches to the branches of its host trees, drawing water and nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions such as Malaysia and Indonesia. Its leaves are usually small, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are unisexual and clustered in catkins. The fruit is a capsule that contains small, dry seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
