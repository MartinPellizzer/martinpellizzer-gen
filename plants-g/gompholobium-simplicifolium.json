    "intro": "Gompholobium simplicifolium, commonly known as the simple-leaved glory pea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow or orange pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its simple, linear leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Gompholobium simplicifolium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
