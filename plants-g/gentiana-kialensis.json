    "intro": "Gentiana kialensis, commonly known as the Kialan gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Turkey. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
