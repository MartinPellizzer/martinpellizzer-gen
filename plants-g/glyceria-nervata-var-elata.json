    "intro": "Glyceria nervata var. elata, commonly known as the slender beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often forming dense stands that help stabilize shoreline areas. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowering spikes are usually slender and drooping, producing small, spikelet-based flowers. This variety is distinguished by its elongated leaf blades and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in aquatic conditions."
