    "intro": "Gentiana foliosa, commonly known as the leaf gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. Gentiana foliosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
