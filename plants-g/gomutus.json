It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, with leaves that are often heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair. Its flowers come in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, white, and yellow, and are often used in ornamental gardening. Gomutus thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
