    "intro": "Grindelia platylepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and yellowish-green flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Grindelia platylepis produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
