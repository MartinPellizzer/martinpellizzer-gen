    "intro": "Gastrochilus hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan gastrochilus, is a rare orchid species native to the southern Chinese province of Hainan. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, dark green to purple-tinged leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or white with a distinctive lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
