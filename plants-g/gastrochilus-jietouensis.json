    "intro": "Gastrochilus jietouensis, commonly known as the Jietou orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and strikingly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with rich soil. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with purple or reddish markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
