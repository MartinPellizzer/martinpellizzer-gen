    "intro": "Guarianthe skinneri f. alba, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its elongated, white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species and is often protected in conservation programs."
