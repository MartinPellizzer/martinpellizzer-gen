It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and fragrant, yellow-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, round, dark blue fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
