    "intro": "Galium marchandii, commonly known as Marchand's bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, and it produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky streambanks. Galium marchandii is often found in California and Oregon, where it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
