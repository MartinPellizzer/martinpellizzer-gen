    "intro": "Gymnogramma myriophylla var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandless water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical regions. It is a small, aquatic fern that typically grows in shallow, still water environments. The plant has finely divided, delicate fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its leaves are usually bright green and lack glands, which distinguishes it from other varieties. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
