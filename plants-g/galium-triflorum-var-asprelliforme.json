It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers in the leaf axils, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
