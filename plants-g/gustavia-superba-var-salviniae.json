    "intro": "Gustavia superba var. salviniae, commonly known as the Salvinia water fern, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It features finely divided, feather-like leaves that allow it to remain buoyant on the water's surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on water for seed dispersal. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
