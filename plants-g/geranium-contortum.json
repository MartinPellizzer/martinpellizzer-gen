    "intro": "Geranium contortum, commonly known as the zigzag geranium, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems that often have a zigzag appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers in the summer months, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough, hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Geranium contortum is well-suited for gardens and naturalized areas due to its ornamental value and adaptability."
