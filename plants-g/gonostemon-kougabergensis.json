    "intro": "Gonostemon kougabergensis, commonly known as the Kougaberg starfish, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its star-shaped, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves to survive drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
