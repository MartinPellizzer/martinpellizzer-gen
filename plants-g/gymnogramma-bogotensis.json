    "intro": "Gymnogramma bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 gymnogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Colombia. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. Gymnogramma bogotensis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
