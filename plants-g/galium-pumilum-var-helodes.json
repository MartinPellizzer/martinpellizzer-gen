    "intro": "Galium pumilum var. helodes, commonly known as the dwarf bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped with a hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or stream banks. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local insect populations."
