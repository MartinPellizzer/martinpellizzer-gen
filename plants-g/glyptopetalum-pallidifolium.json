    "intro": "Glyptopetalum pallidifolium, commonly known as the pale-leaved rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
