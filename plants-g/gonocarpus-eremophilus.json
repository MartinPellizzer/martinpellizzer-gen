    "intro": "Gonocarpus eremophilus, commonly known as the desert mullein, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, woolly leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, featuring deep roots and a slow growth rate. Gonocarpus eremophilus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
