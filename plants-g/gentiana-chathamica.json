    "intro": "Gentiana chathamica, commonly known as the Chatham gentian, is a flowering plant native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to the cool, maritime climate of its native region. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of hair, while its flowers bloom during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
