    "intro": "Guatteria cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Annonaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly in Mexico and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. It produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to those of other guatteria species, often with a smooth, yellow or orange exterior. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
