    "intro": "Glochidion cuspidatum var. samoanum, commonly known as the Samoan glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests or on rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
