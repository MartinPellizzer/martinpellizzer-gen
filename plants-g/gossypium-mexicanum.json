    "intro": "Gossypium mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican cotton, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its soft, fluffy fibers that are used for textile production. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, and it produces small, oval-shaped pods that contain the cotton fibers. Gossypium mexicanum is an important crop in some parts of Latin America for both its fiber and its potential medicinal properties."
