    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea f. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered cowslip, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and woodland edges across Europe. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is noted for its dense inflorescences, which distinguish it from other members of the Gymnadenia genus."
