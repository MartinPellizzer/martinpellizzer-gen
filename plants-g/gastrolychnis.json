It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the stems are often hairy. Gastrolychnis is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting nocturnal pollinators."
