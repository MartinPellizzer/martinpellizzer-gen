    "intro": "Grammica racemosa, commonly known as the clustered spike-rush, is a perennial wetland plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that bears small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a tight rosette at the base. Grammica racemosa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
