    "intro": "Gibsoniothamnus pithecobius, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
