    "intro": "Goodyera marginata, commonly known as the marginate pieris, is a small evergreen epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers with three petals and three sepals, typically arranged in a spike. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
