    "intro": "Gnaphalium dioicum, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces both male and female flowers on separate stems, a trait known as dioecy, which is relatively uncommon in the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it often grows in moist, disturbed soils. The plant is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
