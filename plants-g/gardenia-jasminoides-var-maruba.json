    "intro": "Gardenia jasminoides var. maruba, commonly known as the Maruba gardenia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern China and the Ryukyu Islands. It features glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces fragrant, waxy white flowers with a yellow center, which bloom in summer. It is highly valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a potted plant. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental stress, it requires careful attention to soil, light, and watering conditions."
