    "intro": "Galeopsis tetrahit subsp. verlotii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hedge-nettle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, opposite leaves with serrated edges, and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. This subspecies is often distinguished from the more widespread Galeopsis tetrahit by its narrower leaves and slightly different floral structure."
