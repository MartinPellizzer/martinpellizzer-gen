    "intro": "Glandula, commonly known as the glandular structure, is a specialized plant organ found in various species. It is composed of secretory cells that produce and release substances such as nectar, resins, or oils. These structures are often located on leaves, stems, or flowers and serve functions like attracting pollinators or deterring herbivores. The morphology of glandula can vary, with some being unicellular and others forming complex multicellular clusters. Botanically, glandula plays a crucial role in plant survival and ecological interactions."
