    "intro": "Gossypium hirsutum subsp. punctatum, commonly known as the dotted cotton, is a botanical subspecies of upland cotton. It is characterized by its distinctive dotted or stippled leaves, which set it apart from other cotton varieties. This subspecies is native to parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in warm, tropical climates. The plant produces fluffy, white fibers that are used in textile manufacturing, similar to other cotton species. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in both agricultural and botanical research."
