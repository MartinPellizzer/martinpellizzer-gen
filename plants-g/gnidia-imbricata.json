    "intro": "Gnidia imbricata, commonly known as the African snowball, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white, woolly flowers that resemble snowballs, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Gnidia imbricata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
