    "intro": "Galedupa uliginosa, commonly known as the bog heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wetlands of northern Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in acidic, waterlogged soils and is often found in peat bogs and marshes. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, and it produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is a key species for biodiversity in these habitats. Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland areas."
