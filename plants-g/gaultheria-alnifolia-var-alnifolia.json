    "intro": "Gaultheria alnifolia var. alnifolia, commonly known as the red evergreen huckleberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth margin and a glossy, dark green surface. The berries are edible, though they are typically tart and often used in jams or as a flavoring in local cuisine."
