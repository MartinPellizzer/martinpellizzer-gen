    "intro": "Grastidium torquisepalum, commonly known as the twisted sepal grass, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive floral structure. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is notable for its intricate, spirally twisted sepals that encase the flower. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments, thriving in shaded, humid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture that aids in water retention. Grastidium torquisepalum is of interest to botanists due to its unusual morphology and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
