    "intro": "Gouldia terminalis f. obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed gouldia, is a unique variant of the gouldia species native to Australia. It is characterized by its broad, obovate leaves that are typically a striking shade of red or orange, depending on environmental conditions. The plant is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, and it is relatively low maintenance once established. The plant's botanical features make it a distinctive addition to native gardens and ecological landscapes."
