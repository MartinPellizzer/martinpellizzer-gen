    "intro": "Gomphandra penangiana var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the Penang gomphandra, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is often found in the understorey of dense vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
