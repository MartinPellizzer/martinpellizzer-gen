    "intro": "Geranium cicutarium var. praecox, commonly known as early hogweed, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a tall, erect stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in umbel-like arrangements, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves contain phototoxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals if ingested or if the sap comes into contact with the skin. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in moist, temperate climates."
