It is characterized by its slender, drooping stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, round, green pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Galactia pendula has compound leaves with several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. It is adapted to sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and forests edges."
