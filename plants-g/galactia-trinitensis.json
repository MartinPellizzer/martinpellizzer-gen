    "intro": "Galactia trinitensis, commonly known as the Trinidad milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Trinidad and Tobago. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume pods and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets. Galactia trinitensis is known for its milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of many plants in the milkweed genus. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands."
