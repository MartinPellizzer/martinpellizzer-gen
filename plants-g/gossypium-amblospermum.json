    "intro": "Gossypium amblospermum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cottonweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other cotton species and hibiscus plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fibrous seed pods contain fluffy, white cotton-like hairs, which are used for fiber production in some regions. Gossypium amblospermum is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
