    "intro": "Grastidium kietaense, commonly known as the Kieta grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and savannas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for soil stabilization and as a forage plant."
