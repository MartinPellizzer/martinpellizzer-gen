    "intro": "Gnaphalium cauliflorum, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces numerous small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in dense clusters along the stems, a trait known as cauliflorous growth. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its frost-resistant nature. The plant is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates."
