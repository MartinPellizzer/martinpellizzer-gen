    "intro": "Gymnadenia rubra f. hygrophila, commonly known as the wetland gentian, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking red and white flowers, which bloom in late summer, and its preference for moist, acidic soils. This fern-like orchid typically grows in wet meadows, bogs, and marshy areas, where it thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
