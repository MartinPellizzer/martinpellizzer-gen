    "intro": "Glyceria microtheca, commonly known as narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like clusters of narrow leaves. Its flowers are tiny and inconspicuous, arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Glyceria microtheca plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
