It is a shrub characterized by its dense growth habit and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact form and long blooming period."
