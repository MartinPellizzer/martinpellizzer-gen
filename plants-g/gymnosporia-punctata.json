    "intro": "Gymnosporia punctata, commonly known as the African barberry, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Gymnosporia punctata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions, though caution is advised due to its toxic properties."
