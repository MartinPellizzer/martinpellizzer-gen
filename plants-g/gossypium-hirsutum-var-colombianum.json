    "intro": "Gossypium hirsutum var. colombianum, commonly known as the Colombian cotton plant, is a variant of upland cotton native to South America. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy fibers and robust growth habit, adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native region. The plant typically produces fluffy, white bolls that contain the cotton fibers used for textile production. It exhibits a wide range of morphological variations, including differences in plant height, leaf shape, and flowering time. Due to its genetic diversity, it has been a valuable resource for breeding programs aimed at improving cotton yield and fiber quality."
