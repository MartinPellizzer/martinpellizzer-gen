    "intro": "Goodyera sonoharae, commonly known as the Sonohara's phlox, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and intricate, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on the forest floor or epiphytically on trees. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Goodyera sonoharae is considered a vulnerable species."
