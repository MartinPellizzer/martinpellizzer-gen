    "intro": "Gymnopteris serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a finely serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in humid forests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Gymnopteris serratifolia is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticultural settings where humidity can be maintained."
