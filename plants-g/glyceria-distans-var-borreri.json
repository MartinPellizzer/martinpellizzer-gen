    "intro": "Glyceria distans var. borreri, commonly known as the slender false beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-flowered spikelets. This variety is often distinguished by its slightly shorter stature and narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Glyceria distans."
