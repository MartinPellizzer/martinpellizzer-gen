    "intro": "Guettarda armata, commonly known as the silverleaf guettarda, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Guettarda armata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in saline environments."
