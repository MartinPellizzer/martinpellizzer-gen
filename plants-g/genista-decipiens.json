    "intro": "Genista decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive broom, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its slender, branching stems are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Despite its attractive appearance, it can be invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
