    "intro": "Glossochilus burchellii, commonly known as the Burchell's tongue orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single, showy floral spike that bears several pale yellow to orange flowers. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The orchid is noted for its distinctive lip, which is broad and tongue-shaped, giving it its common name."
