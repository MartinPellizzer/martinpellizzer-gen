It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes other flowering plants such as hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture, while the fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Grewia palembanica is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities in landscaping."
