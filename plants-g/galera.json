    "intro": "Galera, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by ornamental red or orange fruits. Galera is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is highly sought after for carving and fine woodworking. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range."
