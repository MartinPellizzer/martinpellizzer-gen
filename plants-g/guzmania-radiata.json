    "intro": "Guzmania radiata, commonly known as the Radiata Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It features a rosette of glossy, dark green leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces striking red and orange bracts that enclose its small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Guzmania radiata is popular as a decorative plant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
