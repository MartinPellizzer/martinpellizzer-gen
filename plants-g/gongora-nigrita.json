    "intro": "Gongora nigrita, commonly known as the black night orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its dark, velvety petals and sepals, which give it its striking appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Gongora nigrita is considered a conservation concern."
