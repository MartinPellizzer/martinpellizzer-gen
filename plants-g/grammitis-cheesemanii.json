    "intro": "Grammitis cheesemanii, commonly known as the Cheeseman's spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Huperjiaceae and is characterized by its dense, moss-like foliage and spore-producing structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are linear and often arranged in whorls, giving it a unique, compact appearance. Grammitis cheesemanii is of particular interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and limited distribution."
