    "intro": "Goodyera cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf spleenwort, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in leaf litter. Goodyera cordata is a low-growing plant with a rhizomatous root system, and it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
