    "intro": "Galium trifidum f. brevipedunculatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three narrow, lance-shaped lobes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of short peduncles. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its habitat, with compact growth and efficient water retention features."
