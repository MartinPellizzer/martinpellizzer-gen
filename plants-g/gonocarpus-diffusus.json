    "intro": "Gonocarpus diffusus, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in saline or brackish environments, often growing along shores and in wetlands. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its spread. Gonocarpus diffusus plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
