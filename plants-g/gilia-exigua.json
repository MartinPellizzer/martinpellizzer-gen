    "intro": "Gilia exigua, commonly known as the plains gilia, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. Its slender stems and small leaves are adapted to arid conditions, and it is often found in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. Gilia exigua plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
