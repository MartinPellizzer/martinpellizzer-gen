    "intro": "Gomphrena vermicularis, commonly known as the threadleaf gomphrena, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its clusters of small, spiky, pink or red bracts that resemble tiny flames. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by the showy bracts, which are often the main attraction. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Gomphrena vermicularis is also valued for its long flowering period and drought tolerance."
