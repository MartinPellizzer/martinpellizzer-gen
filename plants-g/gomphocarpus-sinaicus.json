    "intro": "Gomphocarpus sinaicus, commonly known as the Sinai milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species known for their milky sap. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring woody stems and opposite leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, clustered in umbels, and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
