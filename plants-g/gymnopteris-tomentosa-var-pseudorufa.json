    "intro": "Gymnopteris tomentosa var. pseudorufa, commonly known as the rusty-tomentose water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Gymnopteris. It is characterized by its distinctive rusty-brown, tomentose (fuzzy) underside on the fronds, which gives it its common name. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with lanceolate pinnae that are often curved and have a serrated margin. This variant is notable for its unique coloration and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
