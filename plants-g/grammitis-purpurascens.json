    "intro": "Grammitis purpurascens, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green with a reddish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and often grows on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Grammitis purpurascens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
