    "intro": "Gaultheria brachyantha, commonly known as the dwarf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense, glossy dark green leaves that remain throughout the year, and it produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring. The plant is notable for its aromatic leaves, which contain methyl salicylate, giving them a wintergreen scent. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. Gaultheria brachyantha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
