Its leaves are typically rounded or ovate, with a velvety texture and a deep green color. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form a dense ground cover."
