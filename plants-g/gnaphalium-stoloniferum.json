    "intro": "Gnaphalium stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features prostrate or ascending stems that form dense mats, often carpeting the ground in moist or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are linear to oblanceolate, with a hairy surface, and the plant is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Gnaphalium stoloniferum is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through stolons, making it a common and persistent weed in many habitats."
