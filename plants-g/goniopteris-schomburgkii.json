The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its fronds are typically bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost palmate appearance. Goniopteris schomburgkii plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
