    "intro": "Gnaphalium horridum, commonly known as the rough sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and the stems are covered in fine, bristly hairs. Gnaphalium horridum is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
