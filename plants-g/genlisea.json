    "intro": "Genlisea, commonly known as the buttercup bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique bladder-like structures used to trap small aquatic organisms. Genlisea species are typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. They are carnivorous, relying on the captured prey for essential nutrients. Their small, delicate flowers are often white or purple, adding to their ornamental appeal."
