    "intro": "Gymnogramma iridifolia, commonly known as the iridescence fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that display a striking iridescent sheen under sunlight. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. Gymnogramma iridifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
