    "intro": "Graptopetalum bernalense, commonly known as the Bernal's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the rocky habitats of Baja California, Mexico. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the spring and early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
