    "intro": "Garcinia pyrifera, commonly known as the African yellow mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright yellow fruits resembling small pineapples. The fruit's pericarp is thick and segmented, containing a sweet, aromatic pulp surrounded by a tough, leathery rind. Garcinia pyrifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
