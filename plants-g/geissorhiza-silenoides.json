It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of deep blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, orchid-like blooms that are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
