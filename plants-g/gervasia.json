    "intro": "Gervasia, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that often have a silvery or grayish hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The flowers are typically showy, with tubular corollas that range in color from white to pink and purple. Native to regions in Africa and Madagascar, Gervasia species are often found in rocky or arid environments. These plants are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
