    "intro": "Gastrodia stapfii, commonly known as the Stapf's orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China, particularly in Yunnan Province. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces a unique, fleshy, reddish-brown pseudobulb that stores nutrients and water, which is characteristic of the Gastrodia genus. It blooms with a single, showy flower that has a distinctive, often fragrant, structure typical of orchids. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
