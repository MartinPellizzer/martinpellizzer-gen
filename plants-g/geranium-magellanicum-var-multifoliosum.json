It features upright stems with opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive, crinkled texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
