    "intro": "Glochidion canaranum, commonly known as the Canara glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cup-shaped inflorescences, followed by woody, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
