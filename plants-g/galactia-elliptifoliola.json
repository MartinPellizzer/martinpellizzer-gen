It is characterized by its slender, elliptical leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods containing edible seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating adaptability to drought conditions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
