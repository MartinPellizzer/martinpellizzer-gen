    "intro": "Guzmania breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed flame plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that displays bright red or orange hues, often resembling a flame. The plant has a rosette-shaped leaf structure that collects rainwater, providing a microhabitat for small organisms. Its leaves are typically broad and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Guzmania breviscapa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush appearance."
