    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza, commonly known as licorice, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to southern Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa, and is widely cultivated for its medicinal and commercial uses. The roots and rhizomes of Glycyrrhiza species contain compounds like glycyrrhizin, which contribute to its bitter taste and therapeutic properties. These plants are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects. Glycyrrhiza also plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
