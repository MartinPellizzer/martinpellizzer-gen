    "intro": "Geniostoma astylum, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in damp, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in late summer. Its flowers have a distinctive three-lobed lip and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. Geniostoma astylum is an important component of wetland ecosystems and is protected in many regions due to habitat loss."
