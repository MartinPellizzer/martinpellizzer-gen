    "intro": "Genipa williamsii, commonly known as the Williams's genipapo, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces small, round fruits that turn from green to a striking red or purple when mature. These fruits are edible, though their flavor is often described as tart or slightly bitter, and they are sometimes used in local cuisines or traditional medicine. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological significance in its native habitats."
