    "intro": "Galium palustre var. lanceolatum, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, ascending stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense colonies. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. This species is valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various invertebrates."
