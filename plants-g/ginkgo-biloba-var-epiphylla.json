    "intro": "Ginkgo biloba var. epiphylla, commonly known as the epiphytic ginkgo, is a rare variant of the ginkgo tree that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. Unlike typical ginkgo trees, this variant often grows on the surfaces of other plants, such as cliffs or trees, as an epiphyte. It possesses a distinct morphology, including smaller, more clustered leaves compared to the standard ginkgo. The plant retains the characteristic fan-shaped leaves and is known for its ability to thrive in diverse environmental conditions. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptability and evolutionary significance."
