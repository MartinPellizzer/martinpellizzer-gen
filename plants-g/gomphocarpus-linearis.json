    "intro": "Gomphocarpus linearis, commonly known as the linear milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a notable feature of its botanical composition. Gomphocarpus linearis is often found in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun."
