    "intro": "Genlisea angolensis, commonly known as the Angola butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, often found in bogs or wetlands. Its trapping mechanism involves specialized leaf structures that curl around prey, facilitating digestion. The botanical features of Genlisea angolensis make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and nutrient acquisition."
