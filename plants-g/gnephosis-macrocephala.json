    "intro": "Gnephosis macrocephala, commonly known as the giant-headed orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, with a distinctive yellow and purple coloration. Native to the tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter in the forest floor. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
