    "intro": "Gnaphalium serotinum, commonly known as the late evening fleabane, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to North America and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has a low, spreading growth habit with finely divided, grass-like leaves. Gnaphalium serotinum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects."
