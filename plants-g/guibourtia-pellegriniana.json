    "intro": "Guibourtia pellegriniana, commonly known as the African teak or African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its strength and beauty. The plant has bipinnate leaves, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in racemes. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its slow growth and high demand, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
