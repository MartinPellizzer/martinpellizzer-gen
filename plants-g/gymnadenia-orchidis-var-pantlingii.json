    "intro": "Gymnadenia orchidis var. pantlingii, commonly known as the Pantling's grass pinks, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and delicate, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its botanical features include tuberous roots and a slender, erect stem that bears several showy, spurred flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
