    "intro": "Gossypium peruvianum f. marie-galante, commonly known as the Marie-Galante cotton, is a botanical variety native to the Caribbean island of Marie-Galante. It is characterized by its small, fluffy cotton fibers that are typically white in color. The plant produces flowers that transition from green to pink as they mature, and the leaves are broad and lobed. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its unique textile fibers. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
