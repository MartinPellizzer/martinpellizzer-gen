    "intro": "Gymnocarpium tenuipes, commonly known as the slender-stemmed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its flowers are inconspicuous, with small, white or greenish petals, and it reproduces primarily through seeds. Gymnocarpium tenuipes plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microscopic life."
