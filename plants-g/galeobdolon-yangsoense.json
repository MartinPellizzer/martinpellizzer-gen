It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring elongated, lanceolate leaves with a smooth or slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination. Galeobdolon yangsoense thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forests with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
