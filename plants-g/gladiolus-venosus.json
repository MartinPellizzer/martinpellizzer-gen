    "intro": "Gladiolus venosus, commonly known as the veiny gladiolus, is a striking herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features tall, sword-shaped leaves with distinctive venation patterns that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with brightly colored, three-lobed flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its flowers are typically borne on one side of the stem, a characteristic known as heliotropism. Gladiolus venosus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
