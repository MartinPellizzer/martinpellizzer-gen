It features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive silver-green coloration and a waxy coating. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
