    "intro": "Genlisea metallica, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its unique trapping mechanism, which consists of bladder-like structures used to capture small aquatic invertebrates. The plant thrives in wet, nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent moisture to maintain its specialized adaptations. Its leaves are typically small and hairless, with the bladders forming at the base of the leaf stalks. The botanical features of Genlisea metallica reflect its evolutionary adaptation to nutrient scarcity, making it a fascinating subject for study in plant physiology and ecology."
