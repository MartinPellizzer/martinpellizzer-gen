    "intro": "Grayia spinosa, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its adaptations to arid environments include deep root systems and the ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Grayia spinosa plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
