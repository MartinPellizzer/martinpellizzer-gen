    "intro": "Gothofreda dombeyana, commonly known as the Dombey's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate, and often translucent flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
