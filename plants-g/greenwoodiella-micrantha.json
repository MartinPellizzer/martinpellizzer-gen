    "intro": "Greenwoodiella micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf greenwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 meter and features dense, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
