    "intro": "Guatteria alticola, commonly known as the cloud forest guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the cloud forests of Central America and northern South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth texture and a dark green color, and it is often found growing on tree trunks or in the understory of dense vegetation. Due to habitat loss, Guatteria alticola is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native ecosystems."
