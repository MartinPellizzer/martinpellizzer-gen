    "intro": "Gilbertiodendron limosum, commonly known as the swamp teak, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing flat, elliptical seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or riparian habitats. Due to its hard, durable wood, it is valued for timber and has ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
