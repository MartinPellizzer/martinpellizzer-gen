It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is smaller than the typical Gratiola aurea, with a more compact growth habit."
