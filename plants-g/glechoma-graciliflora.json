    "intro": "Glechoma graciliflora, commonly known as slenderleaf ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia and Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, pale blue or violet flowers. The plant has a creeping habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Glechoma graciliflora is known for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
