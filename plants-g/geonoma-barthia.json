    "intro": "Geonoma barthia, commonly known as the Barth's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species."
