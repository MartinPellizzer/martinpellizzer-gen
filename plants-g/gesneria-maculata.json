    "intro": "Gesneria maculata, commonly known as the spotted gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It features broad, dark green leaves with distinctive white or silver spots, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically blooming in spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria maculata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
