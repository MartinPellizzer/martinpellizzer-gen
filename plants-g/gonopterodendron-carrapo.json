    "intro": "Gonopterodendron carrapo, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, pointed leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
