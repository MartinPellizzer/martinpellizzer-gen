    "intro": "Galega binata, commonly known as sweet clover, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in dense clusters. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in various soil types, including those that are nutrient-poor. It is also notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it an important plant in agricultural systems. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
