It produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, which are typically followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. The plant is adapted to arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance through its succulent stems and reduced leaf surfaces. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
