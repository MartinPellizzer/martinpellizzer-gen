    "intro": "Gyrostachys longilabris, commonly known as the long-labied gyrostachys, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for rock gardens and dry, well-drained soils. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
