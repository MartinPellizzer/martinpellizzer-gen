    "intro": "Geonoma microstachys, commonly known as the small-stalked genista, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense cluster. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, which bloom during the wet season. Geonoma microstachys is often found in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
