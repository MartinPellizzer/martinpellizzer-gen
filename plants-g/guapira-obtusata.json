    "intro": "Guapira obtusata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or Brazilian cherry, is a deciduous tree native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. Guapira obtusata is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
