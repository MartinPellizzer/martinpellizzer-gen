    "intro": "Gymnocalycium hossei var. nidulans, commonly known as the \"Cactus of the Desert,\" is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its globular to cylindrical stem that often branches and is covered with spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but striking in appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in dry environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
