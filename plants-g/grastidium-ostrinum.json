    "intro": "Grastidium ostrinum, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. Grastidium ostrinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
