    "intro": "Guarea bahiensis, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by large, woody fruits containing up to 18 seeds, which are the edible Brazil nuts. It plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture making."
