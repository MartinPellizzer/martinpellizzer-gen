    "intro": "Geranium pratense var. dissectum, commonly known as the cut-leaved cranesbill, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, pale pink to lilac flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are finely dissected, giving the plant a lacy appearance, and they are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This plant is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
