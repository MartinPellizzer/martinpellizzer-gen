    "intro": "Grossularia greeneana, commonly known as the Greene's gooseberry, is a species of shrub native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy berries that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in cold, mountainous environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to protect it from harsh weather conditions. The berries are edible and have been used traditionally by local communities for their nutritional value and flavor."
