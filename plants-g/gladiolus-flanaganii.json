    "intro": "Gladiolus flanaganii, commonly known as the Flanagan's gladiolus, is a rare and striking member of the Iridaceae family. Native to South Africa, it is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves and showy, brightly colored flowers that typically range from pink to red. The plant produces dense clusters of blooms, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a sought-after addition to botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
