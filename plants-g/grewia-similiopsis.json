It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
