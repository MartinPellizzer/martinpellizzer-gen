    "intro": "Galarhoeus jolkinii, commonly known as the Jolkin's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pale pink and white, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions rich in organic matter. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
