    "intro": "Gaillardia pulchella var. tubulosa, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bright orange and red flower heads, which are composed of both showy ray flowers and tubular disc flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often reddish in color. The swamp milkweed plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
