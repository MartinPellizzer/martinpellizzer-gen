It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and insects. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air, making it well-suited for its natural habitat on trees or rocks.
