    "intro": "Gustavia speciosa, commonly known as the white hibiscus, is a tropical flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a distinctive yellow center, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white powder, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gustavia speciosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
