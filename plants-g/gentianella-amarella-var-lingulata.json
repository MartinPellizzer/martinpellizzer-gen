    "intro": "Gentianella amarella var. lingulata, commonly known as the slender gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. The plant features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
