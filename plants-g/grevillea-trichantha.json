    "intro": "Grevillea trichantha, commonly known as the narrow-leafed waratah, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Grevillea trichantha is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
