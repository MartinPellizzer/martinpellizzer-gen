    "intro": "Gentianella amarella var. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and marshes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
