    "intro": "Guarea langsdorffiana, commonly known as the \"Balsa tree\" or \"Cuban balsa,\" is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and large, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is exceptionally light and is historically valued for its use in model-making and aircraft construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
