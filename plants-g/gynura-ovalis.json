    "intro": "Gynura ovalis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or broadleaf gynura, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Gynura ovalis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
