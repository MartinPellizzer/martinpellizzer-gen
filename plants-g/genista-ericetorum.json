    "intro": "Genista ericetorum, commonly known as the creeping buckthorn, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It features small, needle-like leaves that are dark green and glossy, arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Genista ericetorum is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in difficult environments."
