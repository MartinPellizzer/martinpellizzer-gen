    "intro": "Grastidium steatoglossum, commonly known as the waxy tongue plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the spring and summer months. Its growth habit is typically compact, forming a rosette structure that protects its core from extreme temperatures. Due to its specialized adaptations, it is well-suited for xerophytic gardens and requires minimal watering."
