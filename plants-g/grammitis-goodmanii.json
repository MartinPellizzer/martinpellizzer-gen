    "intro": "Grammitis goodmanii, commonly known as the Goodwin's maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in the understory of forests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Grammitis goodmanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
