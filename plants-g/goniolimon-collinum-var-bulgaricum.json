    "intro": "Goniolimon collinum var. bulgaricum, commonly known as the Balkan goniolimon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, while its stems are usually prostrate or ascending. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
