It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery fuzz. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing near streams or in dense undergrowth. Gouldia macrothyrsa is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
