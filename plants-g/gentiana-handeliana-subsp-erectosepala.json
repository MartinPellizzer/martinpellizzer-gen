It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of hair, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions.
