    "intro": "Galatella villosa, commonly known as the hairy galatella, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, often in shades of red or purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially grown."
