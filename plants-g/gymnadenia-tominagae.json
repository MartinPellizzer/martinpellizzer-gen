    "intro": "Gymnadenia tominagae, commonly known as the Tominaga's grasspenny orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late summer. The plant's floral structure is characteristic of the Orchidaceae family, featuring a lip that is often modified for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often in shaded forest understories, and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
