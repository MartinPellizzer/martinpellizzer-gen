    "intro": "Galium caespitosum, commonly known as bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. Galium caespitosum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
