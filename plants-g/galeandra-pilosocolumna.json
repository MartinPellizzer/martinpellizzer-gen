    "intro": "Galeandra pilosocolumna, commonly known as the hairy columned orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems that can grow up to several meters in height, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the dry season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, typical of its epiphytic lifestyle. Galeandra pilosocolumna thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in the understory of tropical forests."
