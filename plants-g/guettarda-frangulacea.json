    "intro": "Guettarda frangulacea, commonly known as the red mangrove or coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its woody structure and is often found growing in coastal areas, including mangrove swamps and estuaries. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or red in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a rough, leathery texture, while its fruits are capsules that release seeds into the water for dispersal. Guettarda frangulacea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
