    "intro": "Gelasia psychrophila, commonly known as the cold-loving orchid, is a rare flowering plant adapted to extreme cold environments. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is found in high-altitude regions of South America. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that bloom during the short summer months. Its leaves are typically dense and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
