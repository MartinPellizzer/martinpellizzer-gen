    "intro": "Glossorhyncha celebica, commonly known as the Celebes bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant is herbaceous, with slender stems and lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
