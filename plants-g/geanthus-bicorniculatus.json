    "intro": "Geanthus bicorniculatus, commonly known as the two-horned geanthus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polemoniacaceae and is characterized by its striking, two-lobed flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silvery hair, which helps to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
