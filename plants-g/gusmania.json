    "intro": "Gusmania, commonly known as the \"pandora's box\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences that resemble a bouquet of flowers, which are actually a single spadix surrounded by a spathe. Gusmania species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant hues and unique appearance. However, some species are considered invasive in certain regions, posing a threat to local ecosystems."
