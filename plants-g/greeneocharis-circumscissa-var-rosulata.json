    "intro": "Greeneocharis circumscissa var. rosulata, commonly known as the Rosulate Greeneocharis, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit, with dense clusters of finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
