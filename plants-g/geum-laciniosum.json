    "intro": "Geum laciniosum, commonly known as the laceleaf avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long blooming period."
