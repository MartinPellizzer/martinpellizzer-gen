    "intro": "Glycine galactioides, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a leguminous shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Glycine galactioides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in ecological restoration projects."
