    "intro": "Goldfussia bracteata, commonly known as the golden bract bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its bracts, which are modified leaves, are often mistaken for petals and contribute to its ornamental appeal. Goldfussia bracteata is well-suited for rock gardens and dry, well-drained soils."
