    "intro": "Gonocarpus rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leafed gonocarpus, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive fruiting bodies that resemble small, fleshy cones, which contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
