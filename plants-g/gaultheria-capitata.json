    "intro": "Gaultheria capitata, commonly known as the clustered wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub that produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring. The plant's leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. After flowering, it develops bright red berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Gaultheria capitata is valued for its aromatic foliage and ornamental appeal in gardens."
