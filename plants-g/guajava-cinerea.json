    "intro": "Guajava cinerea, commonly known as the silverleaf guajava, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pale green, often silver-tomentose leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by edible, sweet fruits similar to those of the common guava. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
