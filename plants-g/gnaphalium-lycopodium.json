    "intro": "Gnaphalium lycopodium, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, clustered flower heads that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces numerous tiny seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Gnaphalium lycopodium is also noted for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
