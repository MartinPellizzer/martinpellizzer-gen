    "intro": "Geophila, commonly known as silverweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers and often have hairy leaves. They are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Geophila species are perennial herbs that often form dense mats near the ground. Their rhizomatous growth habit allows them to spread and colonize new areas effectively."
