    "intro": "Goodyera pendula, commonly known as the hanging maidenhair fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous fronds that hang from tree branches. The plant has small, bright green, leathery leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, with the fronds often drooping downward. It produces small, yellowish spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its leaves. Goodyera pendula thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
