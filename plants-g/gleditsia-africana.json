    "intro": "Gleditsia africana, commonly known as the African honey locust, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and thorny stems. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It is often found in savannas and woodlands, adapting well to dry and semi-arid conditions. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
