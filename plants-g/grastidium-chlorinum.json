    "intro": "Grastidium chlorinum, commonly known as the green bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat and its ability to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant features specialized bladder-like structures that inflate to capture prey. These bladders are covered in a mucilage that helps in adhesion and digestion. Grastidium chlorinum is typically found in shallow, freshwater environments where it can thrive on nutrients from its captured prey."
