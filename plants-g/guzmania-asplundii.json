    "intro": "Guzmania asplundii, commonly known as the asplundii bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports a microhabitat for insects and microorganisms. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes. Guzmania asplundii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil and high humidity to flourish."
