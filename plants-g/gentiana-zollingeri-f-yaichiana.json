    "intro": "Gentiana zollingeri f. yaichiana, commonly known as the Yaich's gentian, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its deep blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It is a perennial herb with a short, upright stem and lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
