    "intro": "Galactia sangsterae, commonly known as the Brazilian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant can grow up to 2 meters tall. Galactia sangsterae is also known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
