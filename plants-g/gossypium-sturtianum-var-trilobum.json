    "intro": "Gossypium sturtianum var. trilobum, commonly known as Sturt's cotton, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its woolly, hairy leaves and small, pale green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces capsules containing fibrous seeds, which are adapted to the harsh, dry environments it inhabits. Its fibrous material, while not commercially viable like cotton, is used in traditional Aboriginal crafts. This species is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
