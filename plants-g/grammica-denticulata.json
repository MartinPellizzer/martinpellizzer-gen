    "intro": "Grammica denticulata, commonly known as the toothed grammica, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves with fine, tooth-like serrations along the margins. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically arranged in compact inflorescences. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Grammica denticulata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
