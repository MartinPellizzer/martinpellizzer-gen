    "intro": "Gagea foliosa var. genuina, commonly known as the pink gagea, is a rare and delicate perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and thrives in well-drained soils. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
