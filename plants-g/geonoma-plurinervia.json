It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's complex vascular system allows it to efficiently transport water and nutrients in its dense, tropical habitat."
