    "intro": "Guzmania fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant pineapple plant, is a tropical bromeliad native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful rosette of sword-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range from red to orange, often with a fragrant scent. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Guzmania fragrans is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
