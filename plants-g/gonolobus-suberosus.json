    "intro": "Gonolobus suberosus, commonly known as the roughleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, with woody stems that become rough and fissured with age. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually blue to violet in color, blooming in the morning and closing by midday. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a hairy or rough texture, contributing to its common name. Gonolobus suberosus is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, forests, and wetlands, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
