    "intro": "Genista lobelii var. mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritania genista, is a shrub native to the arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soils in harsh environments."
