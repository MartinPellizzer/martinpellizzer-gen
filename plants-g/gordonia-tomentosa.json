    "intro": "Gordonia tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly wax tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, woolly white coating on its young stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the family Ericaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife."
