    "intro": "Gasteria verrucosa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed gasteria, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are broader than those of the typical Gasteria verrucosa. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
