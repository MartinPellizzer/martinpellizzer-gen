    "intro": "Gentiana scabra f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves that are broader than the standard form of G. scabra. Its flowers are tubular with a prominent blue corona, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to semi-shaded environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
