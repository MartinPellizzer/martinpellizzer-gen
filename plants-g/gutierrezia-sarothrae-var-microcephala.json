    "intro": "Gutierrezia sarothrae var. microcephala, commonly known as dwarf golden coneflower, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, branched stems and small, yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant produces pale green, thread-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its nectar-rich flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, making it an important plant in native ecosystems."
