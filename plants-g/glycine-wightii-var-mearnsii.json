The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional use in local communities."
