    "intro": "Galeopsis \u00d7 wirtgenii, commonly known as the hybrid water hound or false hogweed, is a flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae. It is a cross between Galeopsis tetrahit and Galeopsis speciosa, resulting in a plant with distinctive, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant is often found in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, where it thrives in partial to full sun. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an aggressive weed in certain regions. Despite its invasive tendencies, it has been studied for its potential ecological roles and medicinal properties."
