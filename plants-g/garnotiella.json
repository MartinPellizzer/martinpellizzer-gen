    "intro": "Garnotiella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Garnotiella has small, scale-like leaves and produces showy, fragrant blooms that are pollinated by specific insects. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered in many areas."
