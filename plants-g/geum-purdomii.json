    "intro": "Geum purdomii, commonly known as Purdom's avens, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, nodding flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately compound, with three to five leaflets, and it produces small, showy blooms in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Geum purdomii is considered a rare and endangered species."
