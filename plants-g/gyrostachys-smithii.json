It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
