    "intro": "Guarea pauciflora, commonly known as the rare tropical tree, is a member of the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related species. It is native to the humid lowland forests of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its large, compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the rainy season. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
