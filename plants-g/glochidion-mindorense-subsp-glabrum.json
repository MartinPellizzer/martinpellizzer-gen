It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often glabrous or nearly hairless. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas of lowland forests and is adapted to humid tropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
