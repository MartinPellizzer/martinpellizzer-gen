    "intro": "Gossypium ekmanianum, commonly known as the Ekmans cotton, is a species of shrub native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fluffy bolls containing fibrous seeds. Its fibers are similar to those of other cotton species but are less commercially cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
