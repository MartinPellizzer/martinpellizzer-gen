    "intro": "Gypsophila tomentosa var. ilerdensis, commonly known as the Ilerdene silveryweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Turkey. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value lies in its fluffy flower heads and drought tolerance."
