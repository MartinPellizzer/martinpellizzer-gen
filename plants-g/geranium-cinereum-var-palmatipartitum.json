It features palmately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
