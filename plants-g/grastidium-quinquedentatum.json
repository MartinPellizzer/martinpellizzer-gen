It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its scientific name reflects the five teeth-like projections on its flower petals. Grastidium quinquedentatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
