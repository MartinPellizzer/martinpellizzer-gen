    "intro": "Genista depressa subsp. rhodopea, commonly known as the Rhodope shrub, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, leathery pods containing several seeds, and its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardiness and adaptability."
