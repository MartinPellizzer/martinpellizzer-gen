    "intro": "Gothofreda tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its soft, white, woolly foliage that covers its entire stem and leaves, giving it a distinctive, almost ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle touch of color to its otherwise muted habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or among moss-covered stones. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, Gothofreda tomentosa is considered a species of conservation concern."
