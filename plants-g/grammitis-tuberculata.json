    "intro": "Grammitis tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered clusters on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis tuberculata is noted for its unique morphology and is often found in rich, moist forest habitats."
