    "intro": "Grammitis whartoniana, commonly known as Wharton's filmy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are thin and translucent, with a unique structure that allows for efficient water retention. Grammitis whartoniana is noted for its intricate spore-producing structures, which are arranged in clusters on the underside of its fronds."
