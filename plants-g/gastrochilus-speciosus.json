It is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, orange, or yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. The orchid's unique floral structure and vivid pigmentation make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
