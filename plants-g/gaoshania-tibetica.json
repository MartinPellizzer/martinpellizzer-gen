    "intro": "Gaoshania tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with a fine layer of pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Gaoshania tibetica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
