    "intro": "Galium radicosum, commonly known as field bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or colonies. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Galium radicosum is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
