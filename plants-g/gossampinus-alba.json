    "intro": "Gossampinus alba, commonly known as the white silk cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark and large, palmate leaves that turn yellow before falling in autumn. The tree produces fluffy, white seed pods that release cotton-like fibers, which are used in traditional crafts and as a natural insulator. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and riverbanks. The plant is also valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
