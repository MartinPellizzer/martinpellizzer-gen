It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding cup. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and bloom in a spike above the foliage. Grammanthes sebaeoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
