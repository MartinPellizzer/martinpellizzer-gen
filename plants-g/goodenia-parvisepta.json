    "intro": "Goodenia parvisepta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf goodenia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Goodeniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense spikes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Goodenia parvisepta is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland regions with a Mediterranean climate."
