    "intro": "Grammica chrysocoma, commonly known as the golden hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are often yellowish in color. Grammica chrysocoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
