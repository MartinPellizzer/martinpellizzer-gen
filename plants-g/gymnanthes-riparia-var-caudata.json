    "intro": "Gymnanthes riparia var. caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed beautyberry, is a species of flowering plant native to Central America and northern South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Following flowering, it develops bright blue to purple berries that are clustered at the tips of the branches. These berries are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally considered toxic to humans."
