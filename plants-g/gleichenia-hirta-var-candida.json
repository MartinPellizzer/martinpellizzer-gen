    "intro": "Gleichenia hirta var. candida, commonly known as the white-haired maidenhair fern, is a variant of the Gleichenia hirta species. It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a pale green to white underside, giving it its distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
