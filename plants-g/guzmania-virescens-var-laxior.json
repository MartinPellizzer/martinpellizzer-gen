    "intro": "Guzmania virescens var. laxior, commonly known as the broad-leaved flaming sword, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length, often with a reddish or bronze hue at the tips. The plant produces an inflorescence that resembles a sword, with vibrant red bracts that surround a cluster of small, white flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
