    "intro": "Grewia rugosa, commonly known as the roughleaf globemallow, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late winter to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are often hairy or rough to the touch. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds."
