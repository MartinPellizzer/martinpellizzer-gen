    "intro": "Geranium pungens, commonly known as the staghorn plant, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble deer antlers, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Geranium pungens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
