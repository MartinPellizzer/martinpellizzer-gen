    "intro": "Galanthus ikariae, commonly known as the Ikaria snowdrop, is a rare and beautiful member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the island of Ikaria in Greece, where it thrives in woodland and shaded areas. The plant produces delicate white flowers with a green spathe, typically blooming in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in rocky soils and periods of drought. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
