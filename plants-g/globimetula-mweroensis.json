    "intro": "Globimetula mweroensis, commonly known as the Lake Mweru globemallow, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its globular, fleshy stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Globimetula mweroensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
