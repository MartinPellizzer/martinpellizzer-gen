    "intro": "Galium lucidum var. corrudifolium, commonly known as shining bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves. It typically features small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a glossy surface that reflects light, contributing to its common name. This variant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors or stream banks. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value."
