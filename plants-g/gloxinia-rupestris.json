    "intro": "Gloxinia rupestris, commonly known as the rock gloxinia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, often with contrasting darker veins. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Gloxinia rupestris is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its drought-tolerant nature."
