It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss. Galium jordanii is a low-growing perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
