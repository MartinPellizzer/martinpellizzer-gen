    "intro": "Garnotia acutigluma, commonly known as the narrow-leaf garnotia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and spikes of tubular, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds and insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Garnotia acutigluma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warmer climates."
