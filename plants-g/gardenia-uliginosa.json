    "intro": "Gardenia uliginosa, commonly known as swamp gardenia, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for gardeners seeking to incorporate native plants into their landscapes. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
