It features upright stems that are often hairy and bear opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves with prominent stipules. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, typically clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
