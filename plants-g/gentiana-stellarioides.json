The plant belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is known for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and woodlands. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
