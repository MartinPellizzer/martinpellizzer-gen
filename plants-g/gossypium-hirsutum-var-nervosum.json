    "intro": "Gossypium hirsutum var. nervosum, commonly known as the hairy cotton plant, is a variant of upland cotton characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage and fibrous seed pods. It is native to the Americas and is cultivated for its cotton fibers, which are used in textile production. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with serrated leaves and showy pink or white flowers. Its fibrous seeds are encased in a burs-like structure, which aids in seed dispersal. The variety is notable for its genetic diversity and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
