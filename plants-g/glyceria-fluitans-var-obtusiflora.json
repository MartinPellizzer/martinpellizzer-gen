    "intro": "Glyceria fluitans var. obtusiflora, commonly known as the broad-leaved floating grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that often float on the water surface. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers. Its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels makes it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
