    "intro": "Gymnadenia albida var. borensis, commonly known as the northern white gentian, is a rare and striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of northern Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
