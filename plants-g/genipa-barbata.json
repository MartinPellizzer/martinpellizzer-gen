    "intro": "Genipa barbata, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or genipapo, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits resembling cherries. The fruit's pulp contains a yellowish, aromatic substance called genipapine, which is used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests."
