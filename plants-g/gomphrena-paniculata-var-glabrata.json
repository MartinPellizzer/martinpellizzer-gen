    "intro": "Gomphrena paniculata var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth gomphrena, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its clusters of pink or red, spiky flower heads that resemble small torches. The plant produces small, egg-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the 'glabrata' variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless foliage. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. The flowers bloom in late summer and early fall, adding vibrant color to landscapes."
