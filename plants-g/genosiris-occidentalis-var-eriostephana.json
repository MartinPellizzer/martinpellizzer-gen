    "intro": "Genosiris occidentalis var. eriostephana, commonly known as the western genosiris, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The species is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
