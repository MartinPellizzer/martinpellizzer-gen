    "intro": "Geophila pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pyrenees region. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
