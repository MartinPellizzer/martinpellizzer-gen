    "intro": "Glyptocaryopsis distantiflora, commonly known as the distant-flowered grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clump-forming) growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with distantly arranged florets, which are typical of many grass species. It is often found in moist, temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
