    "intro": "Goniothalamus sumatranus, commonly known as the Sumatran starwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and distinctive floral structures. The plant typically grows to a height of 20-30 meters, with a broad canopy and compound leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a unique star-shaped appearance, and it produces fleshy, berry-like fruits. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for both ecological and horticultural research."
