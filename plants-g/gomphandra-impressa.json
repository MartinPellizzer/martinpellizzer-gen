    "intro": "Gomphandra impressa, commonly known as the impressa gomphandra, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
