    "intro": "Glaucium corniculatum, commonly known as the horned poppy, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like seed pods and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a whitish, powdery coating called a glaucous bloom. Glaucium corniculatum is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of the alkaloid papaverine."
