    "intro": "Guardiola tulocarpus var. arguta, commonly known as the argute tulocarpus, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a waxy cuticle and serrated margins that aid in water retention. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with showy, fragrant petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a dense, compact form that makes it suitable for ornamental cultivation. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
