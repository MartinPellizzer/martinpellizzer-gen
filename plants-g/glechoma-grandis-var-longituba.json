    "intro": "Glechoma grandis var. longituba, commonly known as the creeping Jenny or long-stemmed ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features prostrate or ascending stems that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, often rooting at the nodes. The leaves are heart-shaped, with a hairy surface, and the plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its longer stems compared to other Glechoma species."
