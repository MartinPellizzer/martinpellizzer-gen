    "intro": "Goeppertia acuminata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Marantaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking, mottled leaves with a distinctive zebra-like pattern. The plant typically grows as an evergreen perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, which help it store moisture, making it relatively drought-tolerant. While it does not produce showy flowers, its ornamental foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
