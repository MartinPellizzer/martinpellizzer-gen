    "intro": "Gymnosphaera kemberangana, commonly known as the Kemberangana cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically appearing on separate plants, a feature common among cycads. Gymnosphaera kemberangana is native to a limited geographic region in Australia and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
