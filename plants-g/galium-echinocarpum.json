    "intro": "Galium echinocarpum, commonly known as the spiny bladdergrass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by distinctive, spiny, bladder-like fruits. Its growth habit is typically low-growing, with the ability to form dense mats, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Galium echinocarpum is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
