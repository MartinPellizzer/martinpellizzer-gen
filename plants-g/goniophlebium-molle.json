    "intro": "Goniophlebium molle, commonly known as the soft-leafed liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, waxy scales. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called gametophytes, are usually found on the underside of its leaves. Goniophlebium molle plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitats."
