It features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has rounded, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium rotundum is often used in herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
