    "intro": "Grammitis suprasculpta, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the surrounding environment. The plant has slender, wiry fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Grammitis suprasculpta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
