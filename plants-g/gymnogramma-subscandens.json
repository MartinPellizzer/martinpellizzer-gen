It features a rhizomatous growth system that allows it to spread along the ground or climb on vertical surfaces. The leaves are usually bi-pinnate, with a bright green color and a leathery texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
