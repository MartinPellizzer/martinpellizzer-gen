It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in wetlands. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually divided into a series of segments, giving it a distinctive, intricate appearance."
