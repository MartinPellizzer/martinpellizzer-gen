    "intro": "Galium propinquum var. hispidulum, commonly known as hairy bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers clustered in loose umbels, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and also bear the same hairy texture as the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks."
