    "intro": "Glyceria spicata subsp. spicata, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Glyceria spicata subsp. spicata is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and ecological balance."
