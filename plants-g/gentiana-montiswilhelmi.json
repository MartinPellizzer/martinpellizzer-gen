It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.
