    "intro": "Guzmania rugosa, commonly known as the wooly pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant produces a vibrant red flower spike that emerges from the center of the rosette, often accompanied by colorful bracts. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Guzmania rugosa is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and long-lasting foliage."
