    "intro": "Gaultheria bicolor, commonly known as the twinflower, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds and small mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. Gaultheria bicolor thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical with a glossy surface and emit a mild, aromatic scent."
