It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and often have a hairy texture. Gonolobus nipensis is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii and plays a role in local ecosystems."
