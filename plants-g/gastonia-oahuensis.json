    "intro": "Gastonia oahuensis, commonly known as the Oahu hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Oahu. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has adapted to the tropical climate with its succulent leaves and robust stems. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for local pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in conservation efforts."
