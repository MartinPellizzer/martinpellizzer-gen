    "intro": "Gentianella rupicola, commonly known as the rock gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. The plant is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Gentianella rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
