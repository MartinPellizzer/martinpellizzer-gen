It features slender, yellowish-green stems with small, compound leaves that are typically trifoliate. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in spring, which are borne in clusters at the ends of the branches. It is adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a common sight in Mediterranean landscapes. Its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor conditions contribute to its ecological and horticultural significance."
