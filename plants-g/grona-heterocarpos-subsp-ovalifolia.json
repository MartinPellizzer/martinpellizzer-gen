    "intro": "Grona heterocarpos subsp. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf grona, is a shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its lanceolate, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruits are follicles that open by a septicidal valve, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils."
