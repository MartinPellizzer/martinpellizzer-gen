    "intro": "Gomphrena decumbens var. nana, commonly known as dwarf globe thistle, is a compact, flowering plant native to South America. It produces spherical, showy flower heads that range in color from pink to red, resembling small globes. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its short stature and ornamental blooms make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
