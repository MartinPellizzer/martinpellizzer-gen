    "intro": "Galium incanum subsp. centrale, commonly known as the central sand verveine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its leaves are opposite, elliptic to ovate, and covered with fine, silky hairs. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
