    "intro": "Geum lyratum, commonly known as the showy lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It features striking, bright yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, fuzzy hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by the persistent, velvety foliage that remains throughout the winter."
