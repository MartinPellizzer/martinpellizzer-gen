    "intro": "Galium sylvestre subsp. nitidulum, commonly known as glossy bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant features slender, ascending stems covered with small, opposite leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and arranged in clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its notably shiny foliage, which sets it apart from other members of the Galium genus."
