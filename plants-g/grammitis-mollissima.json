    "intro": "Grammitis mollissima, commonly known as velvet fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant has small, delicate fronds that are often clustered closely together, forming a compact, mat-like growth. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. The leaves are typically dark green and have a soft, almost silky texture to the touch."
