    "intro": "Geum rivale subvar. strictum, commonly known as the narrowleaf avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along streambanks and wet meadows. The plant features basal leaves that are narrow and lanceolate, with a hairy texture. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
