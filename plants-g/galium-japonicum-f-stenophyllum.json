    "intro": "Galium japonicum f. stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaf woodryard, is a variant of the woodryard plant native to Japan. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial with slender, often hairy stems. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically arranged in whorls around the stem. Its small white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. This form is distinguished by its more compact growth and narrower foliage compared to the typical form of Galium japonicum."
