    "intro": "Gomphichis carlos-parrae, commonly known as the Carlos Parra's gomphichis, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and faces significant conservation challenges."
