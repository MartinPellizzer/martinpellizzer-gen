    "intro": "Gymnoleima graminifolium, commonly known as the grass-leaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features slender, arching fronds with small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a dense, carpet-like pattern. Gymnoleima graminifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns."
