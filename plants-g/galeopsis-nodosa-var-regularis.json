    "intro": "Galeopsis nodosa var. regularis, commonly known as common hedge-nettle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in whorled clusters, which are often mistaken for insect nests due to their dense, hairy appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. The species is noted for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open habitats."
