    "intro": "Grammitis lehmanniana, commonly known as the Lehmann's filmy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, giving it a silky appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for dispersal. Grammitis lehmanniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
