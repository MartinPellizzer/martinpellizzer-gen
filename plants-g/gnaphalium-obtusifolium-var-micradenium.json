    "intro": "Gnaphalium obtusifolium var. micradenium, commonly known as the woolly cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense, white to pale green fluffy heads that are composed of tiny, scale-like flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant has slender, often hairy stems and broad, rounded leaves that are usually covered with fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in ecological succession."
