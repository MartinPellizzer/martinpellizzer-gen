    "intro": "Gleditsia triacantha, commonly known as the thorned honeylocust, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 inches long and composed of 15 to 30 pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by long, slender pods that contain edible seeds. Its thorny branches and drought-resistant nature make it a hardy plant adapted to a variety of soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
