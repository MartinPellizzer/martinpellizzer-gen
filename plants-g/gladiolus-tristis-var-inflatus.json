It is characterized by its distinctive, swollen, and often inflated floral bracts that give it a unique appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in some areas."
