    "intro": "Gastrorchis francoisii, commonly known as the Fran\u00e7ois's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically display a combination of white and green hues. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for protective measures."
