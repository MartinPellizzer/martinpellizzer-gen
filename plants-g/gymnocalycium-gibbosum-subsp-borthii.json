    "intro": "Gymnocalycium gibbosum subsp. borthii, commonly known as the Borth's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Argentina. It is characterized by its spherical or slightly elongated stem, which is covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance. Gymnocalycium gibbosum subsp. borthii thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established."
