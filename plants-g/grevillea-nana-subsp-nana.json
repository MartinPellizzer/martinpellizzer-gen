    "intro": "Grevillea nana subsp. nana, commonly known as the dwarf grevillea, is a low-growing shrub native to Western Australia. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically bright green, often with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in clusters, which are borne on slender stems during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal and drought tolerance."
