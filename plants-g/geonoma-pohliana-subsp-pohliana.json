    "intro": "Geonoma pohliana subsp. pohliana, commonly known as the Pohliana fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Marattiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as tropical rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. The subsp. pohliana is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
