    "intro": "Gleichenia pubescens var. tomentosa, commonly known as the velvety maidenhair fern, is a fern species characterized by its soft, hairy texture on the fronds. It belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The plant features long, narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, fuzzy hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
