    "intro": "Geum lobatum, commonly known as the broadleaf avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic with toothed margins, and its stems are usually hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Geum lobatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and wildlife."
