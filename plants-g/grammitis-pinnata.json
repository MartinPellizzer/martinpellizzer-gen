    "intro": "Grammitis pinnata, commonly known as the feather-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that create a lacy appearance. Grammitis pinnata thrives in humid environments and is often found in rainforests and shaded areas."
