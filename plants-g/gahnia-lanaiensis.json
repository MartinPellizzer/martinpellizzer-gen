    "intro": "Gahnia lanaiensis, commonly known as Lanai grass, is a species of sedge native to the Hawaiian island of Lanai. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Gahnia lanaiensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
