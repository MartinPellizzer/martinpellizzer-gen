It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are grass-like, and the flowers are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. Gymnadenia miniata is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
