    "intro": "Grammitis holophlebia, commonly known as the silver fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a silvery underside due to the presence of trichomes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Grammitis holophlebia is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological systems of its native habitats."
