It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes used in reforestation efforts."
