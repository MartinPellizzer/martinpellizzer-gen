    "intro": "Gleichenia affinis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth Gleichenia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like fronds that are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fertile fronds."
