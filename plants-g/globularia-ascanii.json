    "intro": "Globularia ascanii, commonly known as the Canary Island globularia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a dense, rounded foliage that gives it its common name, with small, dark green leaves arranged in a compact, globular shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in Mediterranean climates."
