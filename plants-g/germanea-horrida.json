    "intro": "Germanea horrida, commonly known as the rough geranium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a rough and sometimes prickly texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Germanea horrida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
