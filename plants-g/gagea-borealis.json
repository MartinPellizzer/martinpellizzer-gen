    "intro": "Gagea borealis, commonly known as the northern gagea, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. The plant produces delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are an important food source for various insects and small mammals. Gagea borealis is valued for its ecological role and is often found in conservation efforts due to its limited distribution."
