    "intro": "Glandularia angustilobata, commonly known as narrow-lobed glandularia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, arranged in dense, showy clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Glandularia angustilobata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
