    "intro": "Gonocarpus vernicosus, commonly known as the swamp milk tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, thriving in humid, waterlogged soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by water. The plant has a unique ability to tolerate and even thrive in conditions with poor soil quality and standing water."
