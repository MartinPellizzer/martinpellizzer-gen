    "intro": "Griffithia magnoliipetala, commonly known as the Griffith's magnolia, is a rare and ancient flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, showy, white petals that resemble those of magnolia species, though it belongs to the family Magnoliaceae. The plant has a unique, elongated ovary and produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth texture and a dark green upper surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
