    "intro": "Gomphocarpus stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, narrow leaves. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, which is toxic, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Gomphocarpus stenophyllus is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
