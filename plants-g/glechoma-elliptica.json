    "intro": "Glechoma elliptica, commonly known as ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with scalloped edges and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant spreads rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that can become invasive in certain environments. It thrives in moist, shady areas and is often found in lawns and along woodland paths. Glechoma elliptica is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
