    "intro": "Geanthus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf geanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, commonly known as the heath family, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and leathery, providing a dense canopy that helps retain moisture in its natural habitat. The flowers, which bloom in late spring, are often pink or white and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
