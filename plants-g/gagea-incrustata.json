    "intro": "Gagea incrustata, commonly known as the rock garlic, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its small, grass-like leaves and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, bulbous structures called corms, which are similar to bulbs and serve as storage organs. Gagea incrustata thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is noted for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native habitats."
