    "intro": "Gyrostachys polyantha, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a small, deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters during the winter months. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release its seeds."
