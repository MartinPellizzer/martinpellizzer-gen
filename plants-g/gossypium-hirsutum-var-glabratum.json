    "intro": "Gossypium hirsutum var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth cotton plant, is a variant of upland cotton characterized by its reduced pubescence. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is native to the Americas. The plant produces fluffy fibers encasing its seeds, which are harvested for textile use. Its leaves are typically ovate with a hairy surface, though the variety is noted for its smoother texture. This variant is less common in commercial cultivation compared to other cotton types."
