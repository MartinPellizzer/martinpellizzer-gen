    "intro": "Ginalloa cumingiana, commonly known as the Cuming's ginseng, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with well-drained soil, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
