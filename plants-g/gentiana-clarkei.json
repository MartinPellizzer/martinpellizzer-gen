    "intro": "Gentiana clarkei, commonly known as Clarke's gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gentiana clarkei is considered a rare and endangered species."
