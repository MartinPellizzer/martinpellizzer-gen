    "intro": "Gymnadenia cenisia, commonly known as the pink fairies' kisses, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking pink to lilac flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, often in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that can reach up to 30 cm in height. Gymnadenia cenisia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
