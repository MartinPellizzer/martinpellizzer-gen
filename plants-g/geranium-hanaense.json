    "intro": "Geranium hanaense, commonly known as the Hana Island geranium, is a perennial herb native to the island of Hana in Maui, Hawaii. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of five-petaled, bright pink to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
