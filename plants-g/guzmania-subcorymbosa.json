    "intro": "Guzmania subcorymbosa, commonly known as the coral pineapple, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, spiky inflorescence that resembles a pineapple. The plant features a rosette of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water in a central cup, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its flowers, which appear in a colorful, branched structure, are typically red, orange, or yellow, adding visual interest to its appearance. Guzmania subcorymbosa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
