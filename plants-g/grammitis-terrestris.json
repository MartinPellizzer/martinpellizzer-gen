    "intro": "Grammitis terrestris, commonly known as the creeping grammitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow close to the ground, forming dense, mat-like colonies. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis terrestris plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
