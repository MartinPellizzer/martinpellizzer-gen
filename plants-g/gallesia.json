    "intro": "[WRONG START] Galsia, commonly known as the Gallesia tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking appearance. However, it is relatively rare in cultivation and requires specific conditions to thrive."
