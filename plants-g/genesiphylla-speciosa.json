    "intro": "Genesiphylla speciosa, commonly known as the silky oak, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a large tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are covered in a fine, silky layer of fine hairs, which gives it its common name. The species is valued for its timber and is also used in horticulture for its ornamental features."
