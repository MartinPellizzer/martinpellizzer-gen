    "intro": "Grammitis nudicarpa, commonly known as the naked-fruited fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore capsules that are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. Grammitis nudicarpa thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in rainforests. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed tropical ecosystems."
