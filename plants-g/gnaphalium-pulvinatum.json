    "intro": "Gnaphalium pulvinatum, commonly known as the cushion flower or greenhead, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in rocky soils and high elevations. Its structure consists of a dense rosette of leaves that form a cushion-like shape, which helps it retain heat and moisture. The flowers are small, yellowish, and appear in clusters, contributing to its role in pollination and ecological interactions."
