    "intro": "Galearia finlaysoniana, commonly known as the Finlayson's galearia, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in cloud forest or paramo ecosystems. Its flowers are small and white to pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
