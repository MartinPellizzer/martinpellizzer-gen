    "intro": "Glomera scopulata, commonly known as the rock glomera, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Glomera scopulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
