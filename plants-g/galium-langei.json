    "intro": "Galium langei, commonly known as the Lange's bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing herb with slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. Galium langei is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
