    "intro": "Gleditsia nana, commonly known as the dwarf honeylocust, is a small, deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes, followed by flat, bean-like pods that contain seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to a variety of soil types. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
