    "intro": "Gymnostachys, commonly known as the \"gum tree\" or \"gum plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. They are characterized by their woody stems and often have a milky sap that can be toxic. Gymnostachys species typically produce showy, often pink or red flowers that attract pollinators like birds and insects. The leaves are usually alternate and may have a hairy texture, contributing to their distinctive appearance."
