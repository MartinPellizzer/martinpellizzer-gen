    "intro": "Gomphocarpus torreyi var. xanti, commonly known as the yellow milkweed, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap is a distinguishing feature, and it serves as a host plant for certain butterfly species. The variety xanti is notable for its slightly different leaf shape and floral structure compared to the typical form of Gomphocarpus torreyi."
