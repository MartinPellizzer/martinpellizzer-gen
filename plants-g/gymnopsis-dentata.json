    "intro": "Gymnopsis dentata, commonly known as the toothed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and small, tooth-like structures along its leaves. The plant is typically found in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Gymnopsis dentata is a carnivorous plant that traps small aquatic invertebrates using its bladder-like structures. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant morphology and carnivory."
