It is a low-growing perennial herb with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
