    "intro": "Gomidesia reticulata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nettle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on wiry stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its stinging hairs, it should be handled with care."
