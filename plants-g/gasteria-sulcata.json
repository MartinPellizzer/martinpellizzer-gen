    "intro": "Gasteria sulcata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent perennial native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with distinctive white or light green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, tubular white or pale yellow flowers. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. Gasteria sulcata is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appearance."
