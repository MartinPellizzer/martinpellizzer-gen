    "intro": "Geum atlanticum, commonly known as sea blush, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of eastern North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the Atlantic coast. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and often have a fuzzy texture. Geum atlanticum is adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a hardy species found in maritime environments."
