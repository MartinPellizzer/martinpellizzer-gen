    "intro": "Gymnopteris normalis, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, Africa, and Australia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Gymnopteris normalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
