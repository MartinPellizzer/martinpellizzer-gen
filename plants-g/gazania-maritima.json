    "intro": "Gazania maritima, commonly known as the sea daisies, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It is a succulent perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive central disk, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its fleshy leaves are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Gazania maritima is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
