    "intro": "Globularia alypum var. eriocephala, commonly known as the woolly globe-thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a compact, globular shape with dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
