    "intro": "Geranium albidum, commonly known as the white geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
