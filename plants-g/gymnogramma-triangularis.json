    "intro": "Gymnogramma triangularis, commonly known as the triangular fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, triangular-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both roots and new fronds. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a serrated margin and a glossy, dark green appearance. Gymnogramma triangularis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
