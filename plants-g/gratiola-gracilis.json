    "intro": "Gratiola gracilis, commonly known as slender yellowroot, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces tiny, oval fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Gratiola gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
