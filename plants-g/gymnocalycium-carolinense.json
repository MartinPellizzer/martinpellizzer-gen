    "intro": "Gymnocalycium carolinense, commonly known as the Carolina moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, typical of cacti. The plant produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Gymnocalycium carolinense is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
