    "intro": "Gumira taitensis, commonly known as the Taiti gumira, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Taiti in the South Pacific. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gumira taitensis is considered a rare and endemic species."
