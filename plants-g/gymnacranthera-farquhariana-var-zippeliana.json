    "intro": "Gymnacranthera farquhariana var. zippeliana, commonly known as the Zippel's gymnacranthera, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with white petals and yellow stamens, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and floral structure compared to the typical form of Gymnacranthera farquhariana."
