    "intro": "Graphorkis galbana, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Southeast Asia. This plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers, which resemble small bells, hence its common name. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forest understoreys, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. The plant's foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that help it capture sunlight in low-light conditions. Its unique floral structure and vivid coloration make it a popular choice for both horticultural collections and botanical studies."
