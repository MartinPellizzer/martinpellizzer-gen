    "intro": "Guzmania herthae, commonly known as the Herth's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool that supports small aquatic life. Its foliage is often adorned with intricate patterns and a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its humid environment. Guzmania herthae thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
