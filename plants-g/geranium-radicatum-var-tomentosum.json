    "intro": "Geranium radicatum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems covered in dense, white to grayish fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are ovate to rounded, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
