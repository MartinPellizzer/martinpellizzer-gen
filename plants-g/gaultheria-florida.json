    "intro": "Gaultheria florida, commonly known as the Florida waxmyrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a waxy coating that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps and wetlands. Gaultheria florida is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
