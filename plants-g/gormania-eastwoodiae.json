    "intro": "Gormania eastwoodiae, commonly known as the Eastwood's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, pale green fronds that resemble ghostly outlines against the rocky terrain. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial shade to flourish. Its reproductive system relies on spores, which are dispersed by wind, making it challenging to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
