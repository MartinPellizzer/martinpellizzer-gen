    "intro": "Gymnogramma gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically short and broad, with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. Gymnogramma gardneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
