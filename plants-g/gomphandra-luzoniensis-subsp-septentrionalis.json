    "intro": "Gomphandra luzoniensis subsp. septentrionalis, commonly known as the Northern Luzon gomphandra, is a rare endemic plant species found exclusively in the mountainous regions of northern Luzon, Philippines. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as montane forests and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in dense undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat degradation."
