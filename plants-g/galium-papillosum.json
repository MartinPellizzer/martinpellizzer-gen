    "intro": "Galium papillosum, commonly known as the hairy bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Galium papillosum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
