    "intro": "Galeopsis ladanum f. calcarea, commonly known as the calcarea form of common hemlock, is a variant of the annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, which is reflected in its specific epithet \"calcarea.\" It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. This form is generally similar to the typical species but may exhibit slight variations in leaf morphology and growth habit."
