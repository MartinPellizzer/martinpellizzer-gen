    "intro": "Guzmania musaica var. discolor, commonly known as the pink guzmania, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, pinkish-red bracts that surround the central inflorescence, giving it a dramatic and eye-catching appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, anchoring itself to trees in its natural habitat, and it thrives in high humidity and indirect light. Its rosette-shaped leaves are often dark green with a waxy texture, and they collect water in a central cup, which supports the growth of small aquatic organisms. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
