The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Gifola numidica is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy and low-maintenance characteristics."
