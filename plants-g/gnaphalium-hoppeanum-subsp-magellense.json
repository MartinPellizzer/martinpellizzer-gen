    "intro": "Gnaphalium hoppeanum subsp. magellense, commonly known as the Antarctic groundsel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the southern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it against harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and subantarctic regions. Due to its specialized adaptations, it is an important component of the flora in its native habitats."
