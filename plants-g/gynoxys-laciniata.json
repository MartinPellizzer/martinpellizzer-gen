    "intro": "Gynoxys laciniata, commonly known as the Mexican feather fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
