    "intro": "Gastrolobium argyrotrichum, commonly known as the silver-haired wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often spindly stems and small, bright yellow flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has feathery, finely divided leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silky white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments and is often found in sandy soils. Gastrolobium argyrotrichum is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
