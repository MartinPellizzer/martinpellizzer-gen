    "intro": "Galarhoeus glareosus, commonly known as the golden spire orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
