    "intro": "Gentiana germanica subsp. bulgarica, commonly known as the Bulgarian gentian, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous regions. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
