    "intro": "Gossypium virgatum, commonly known as the Virgin's cotton or wild cotton, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas of Florida and Georgia. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds encased in a fibrous capsule, which is characteristic of the cotton genus. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a hairy texture, and it typically grows in wetland or marshy environments. Gossypium virgatum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its potential as a source of natural fibers."
