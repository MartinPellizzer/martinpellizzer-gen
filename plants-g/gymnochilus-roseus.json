    "intro": "Gymnochilus roseus, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. Gymnochilus roseus thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
