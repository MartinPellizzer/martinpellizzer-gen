    "intro": "Gonocarpus mucronatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in tidal zones and along shorelines. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds and insects, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Gonocarpus mucronatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
