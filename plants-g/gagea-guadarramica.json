    "intro": "Gagea guadarramica, commonly known as the Guadarrama spring bulb, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained and sunny habitats. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh environments, often remaining dormant during dry periods. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
