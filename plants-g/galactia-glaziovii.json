    "intro": "Galactia glaziovii, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that attract pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, hairy pods that split open when mature to release the seeds. Galactia glaziovii is often found in dry, rocky soils and can thrive in arid environments."
