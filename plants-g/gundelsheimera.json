    "intro": "Gundelsheimera, commonly known as the dwarf ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical gardens."
