    "intro": "Galanthus nivalis var. plenus, commonly known as the double snowdrop, is a variant of the snowdrop plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered flowers that consist of two sets of petals, giving it a more elaborate appearance than the typical snowdrop. The plant produces white, bell-shaped blooms that emerge early in the spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in woodland or shady garden settings, preferring well-drained, moist soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its delicate, frost-resistant flowers."
