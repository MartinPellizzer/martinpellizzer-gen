    "intro": "Guettarda holocarpa, commonly known as the broadleaf guettarda, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often glossy leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to tolerate partial shade, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
