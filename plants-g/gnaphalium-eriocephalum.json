It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in heads, typical of the daisy family. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions. Gnaphalium eriocephalum is a perennial herb that can spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
