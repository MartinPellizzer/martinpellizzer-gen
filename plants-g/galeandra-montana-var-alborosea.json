    "intro": "Galeandra montana var. alborosea, commonly known as the white-flowered galeandra, is a striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous white to pale pink flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories where it thrives on the forest floor. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture in its natural habitat. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively manageable care requirements."
