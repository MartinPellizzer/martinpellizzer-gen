It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are small, leathery, and evergreen, contributing to its hardy nature. Genista andreana is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
