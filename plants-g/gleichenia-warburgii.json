    "intro": "Gleichenia warburgii, commonly known as the Warburg's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and often segmented fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the undersides of the fronds. Gleichenia warburgii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
