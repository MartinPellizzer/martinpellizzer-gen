    "intro": "Geranium erianthum, commonly known as the spreading geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems that often branch at the base, producing clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges and a hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. The plant is known for its ability to spread via stolons, forming dense mats that can suppress weeds."
