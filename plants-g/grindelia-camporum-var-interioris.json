It features a woody stem that becomes increasingly branched with age, and its leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Grindelia camporum var. interioris is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
