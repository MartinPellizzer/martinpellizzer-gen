    "intro": "Gastridium scabrum, commonly known as the rough gastridium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands or along rocky outcrops. The plant has slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, rough textures. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain several seeds. Gastridium scabrum is adapted to dry conditions and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
