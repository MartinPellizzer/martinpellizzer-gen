    "intro": "Gyrostachys brevilabris, commonly known as the narrow-lipped sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
