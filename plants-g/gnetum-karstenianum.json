It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. The plant features opposite, simple, and usually elliptic leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces distinctive, three-lobed seed cones. The plant has a unique vascular system and is considered a living fossil due to its primitive characteristics."
