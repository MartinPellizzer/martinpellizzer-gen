    "intro": "Geum album var. flavum, commonly known as the yellow avens, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features basal leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
