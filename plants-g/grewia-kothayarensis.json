    "intro": "Grewia kothayarensis, commonly known as the Kothayarensis globemallow, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, round, fleshy fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
