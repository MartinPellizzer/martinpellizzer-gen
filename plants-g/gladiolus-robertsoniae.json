    "intro": "Gladiolus robertsoniae, commonly known as the Robertson's gladiolus, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, tall spikes of vibrant, often purple or red flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in well-drained, rocky soils. It is classified as a monocot, belonging to the Iridaceae family, and is closely related to other gladiolus species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
