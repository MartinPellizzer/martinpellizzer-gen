    "intro": "Guzmania caulescens, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. Its most notable characteristic is the vibrant red bracts that surround the inflorescence, giving it its dramatic appearance. Guzmania caulescens is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
