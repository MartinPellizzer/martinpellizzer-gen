    "intro": "Gentianella dacrydioides, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of narrow, silver-blue leaves that help it survive in cold, alpine environments. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact size and striking floral display make it a notable species in its ecological niche. Gentianella dacrydioides is adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes."
