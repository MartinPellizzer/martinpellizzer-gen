    "intro": "Gossypium microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf cotton or small-fruited cotton, is a species of wild cotton native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, hairy capsules that contain fibrous seeds, typical of the cotton genus. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are yellow and are followed by the characteristic cotton-like bolls. This species is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic diversity and adaptability."
