It features upright, branched stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The flowers are typically pink or red, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
