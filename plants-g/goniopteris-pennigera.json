    "intro": "Goniopteris pennigera, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a complex rhizome system that supports its massive foliage and enables it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in rows on the underside of the fronds. Goniopteris pennigera is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance."
