It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, spiky, bluish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. Gomphrena desertorum var. hygrophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in xeriscaping."
