It is native to the mountainous regions of the Dominican Republic and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by bright red berries that are edible. Gaultheria domingensis thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests. Its aromatic leaves and medicinal properties have made it of interest in both horticulture and traditional medicine."
