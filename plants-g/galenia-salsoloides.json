    "intro": "Galenia salsoloides, commonly known as coastal sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves adapted to arid and saline environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense spikes, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Galenia salsoloides is often found in dune habitats and is well-suited to harsh coastal conditions."
