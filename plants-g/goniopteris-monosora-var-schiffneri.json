    "intro": "Goniopteris monosora var. schiffneri, commonly known as the Schiffner's shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed shield fern. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into several pairs of pinnae. The plant has a distinctive, almost shield-like appearance due to the arrangement of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
