    "intro": "Gentiana lutea subsp. montserratii, commonly known as the Montserrat gentian, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and mountain meadows. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
