    "intro": "Gaultheria phillyreifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that remain evergreen throughout the year. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and mammals. Gaultheria phillyreifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its aromatic foliage contains compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their stimulating and analgesic properties."
