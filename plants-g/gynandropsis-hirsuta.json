    "intro": "Gynandropsis hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy gynandropsis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Gynandropsis hirsuta is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
