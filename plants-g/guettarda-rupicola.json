    "intro": "Guettarda rupicola, commonly known as the rock guettarda, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year, adding ornamental value to its appearance. Its adaptability to rocky and well-drained soils makes it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution."
