    "intro": "Geococcus pusillus, commonly known as the tiny green alga, is a microscopic aquatic plant belonging to the Chlorophyta division. It is characterized by its small size, typically less than 10 micrometers in diameter, and its ability to thrive in freshwater environments. This alga forms dense colonies that can be found on the surfaces of ponds, lakes, and even in moist soil. Its simple structure consists of a single cell with chloroplasts that enable photosynthesis. Geococcus pusillus plays a minor but important role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to primary production and serving as a food source for microorganisms."
