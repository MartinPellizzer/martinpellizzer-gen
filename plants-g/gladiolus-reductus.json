    "intro": "Gladiolus reductus, commonly known as the reduced gladiolus, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more delicate flowers compared to other gladiolus species. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and blooms in shades of pink, white, and pale red. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
