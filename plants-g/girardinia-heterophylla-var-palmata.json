It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that float on the water surface. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to anchor in shallow waters. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with showy petals that attract pollinators. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
