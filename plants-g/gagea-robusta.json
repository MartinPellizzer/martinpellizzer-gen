It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stems. Gagea robusta thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Its foliage and flowers are adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat."
