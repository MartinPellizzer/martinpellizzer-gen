    "intro": "Gnaphalium radicans, commonly known as the creeping cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Gnaphalium radicans is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
