    "intro": "Geosiris aphylla, commonly known as the leafless geosiris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its absence of true leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its roots are known to form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Geosiris aphylla typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks."
