    "intro": "Gymnogramma felipponei, commonly known as the Felippone's maidenhair, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common in many ferns. Gymnogramma felipponei is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded habitats. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
