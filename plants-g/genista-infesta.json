It features slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by pods containing several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Genista infesta is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and scrubland habitats."
