It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in supporting pollinator populations."
