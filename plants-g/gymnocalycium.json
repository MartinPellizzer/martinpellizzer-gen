    "intro": "Gymnocalycium, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a genus of cacti native to South America. These plants are characterized by their globular or cylindrical stems, which are typically covered in spines and sometimes have a colorful, fleshy covering called a cephalium. Gymnocalycium species are often cultivated for their striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. They are drought-tolerant and prefer well-draining soil, making them suitable for arid environments. The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are popular in succulent collections due to their unique appearance and ease of care."
