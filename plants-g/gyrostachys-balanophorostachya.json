    "intro": "Gyrostachys balanophorostachya, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its woody structure and the presence of specialized roots that form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The species is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically in construction and craftsmanship."
