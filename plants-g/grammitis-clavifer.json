    "intro": "Grammitis clavifer, commonly known as the club-bearing fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often clustered in dense tufts. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and the spores are released during the dry season. Grammitis clavifer is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
