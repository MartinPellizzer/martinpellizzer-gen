    "intro": "Gayophytum diffusum, commonly known as the creeping marshplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in South America. It features a sprawling growth habit with slender,\u530d\u5310 (creeping) stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. It thrives in shallow water or damp terrestrial habitats, making it an important component of aquatic and wetland ecosystems."
