    "intro": "Glandularia setacea, commonly known as the sticky fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which can trap small insects. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert environments. Glandularia setacea is a member of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads."
