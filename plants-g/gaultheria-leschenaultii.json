    "intro": "Gaultheria leschenaultii, commonly known as the Chilean wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Andes of Chile and Argentina. It features dense clusters of small, dark green leaves that are aromatic and slightly hairy. The plant produces white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties."
