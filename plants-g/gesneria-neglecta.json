    "intro": "Gesneria neglecta, commonly known as the dwarf gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in the spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria neglecta is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
