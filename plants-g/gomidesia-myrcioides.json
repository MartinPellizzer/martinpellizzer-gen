It is native to the Atlantic Forest of eastern Brazil and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, with a dense, bushy habit.
