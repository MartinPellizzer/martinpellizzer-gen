It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in dry, well-drained soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall low, spreading form. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
