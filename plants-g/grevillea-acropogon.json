    "intro": "Grevillea acropogon, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grevillea, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and striking red or orange flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are composed of long, narrow petals and are adapted for pollination by nectar-feeding birds, particularly honeyeaters. Grevillea acropogon is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to dry, well-drained soils."
