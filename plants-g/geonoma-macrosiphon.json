    "intro": "Geonoma macrosiphon, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its leaves. Geonoma macrosiphon plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
