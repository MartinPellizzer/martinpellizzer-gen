    "intro": "Gouania sandwichiana, commonly known as the Hawaiian gouania, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five to seven lobes, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as rainforests and is often found near streams or in rocky habitats. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered threatened and is protected in its native range."
