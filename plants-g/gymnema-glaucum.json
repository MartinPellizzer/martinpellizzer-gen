    "intro": "Gymnema glaucum, commonly known as the Indian bitter leaf, is a shrub native to the wet tropical forests of India and Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant is notable for its unique ability to inhibit the taste of sweetness, a property that has been utilized in traditional medicine. Its flowers are small and yellow, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, hairy seeds. Gymnema glaucum is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, including its use in managing blood sugar levels."
