    "intro": "Gaultheria commutata, commonly known as the trailing evergreen strawberry, is a species of shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, edible berries in the summer. These berries are rich in antioxidants and have a tart, slightly sweet flavor. Gaultheria commutata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
