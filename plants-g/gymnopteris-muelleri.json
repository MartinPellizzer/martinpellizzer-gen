    "intro": "Gymnopteris muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's barren fern, is a species of fern native to Australia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky outcrops. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Gymnopteris muelleri is often found in regions with temperate climates and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
