It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green and smooth to the touch. The plant is native to various regions in the Southern Hemisphere, including South America, Africa, and Australia. Gleichenia nitidula thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its propagation through spores."
