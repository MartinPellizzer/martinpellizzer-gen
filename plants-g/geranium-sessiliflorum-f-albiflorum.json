    "intro": "Geranium sessiliflorum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered geranium, is a cultivar of the geranium species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically rounded and have a slightly hairy texture, providing a contrast to the pale flowers. This variety thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
