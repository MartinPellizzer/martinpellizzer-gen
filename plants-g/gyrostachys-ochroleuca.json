    "intro": "Gyrostachys ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, perennial herb with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. The plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is more noticeable when the foliage is crushed."
