    "intro": "Gutenbergia eylesii, commonly known as the Eyles' ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its pale, ghostly white flowers that resemble the shape of a ghost, giving it its common name. The plant has a slender, leafless stem and produces small, delicate leaves at the base. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
