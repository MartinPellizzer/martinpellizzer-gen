It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its creeping growth habit and ability to form dense mats make it a common ground cover in its native habitats."
