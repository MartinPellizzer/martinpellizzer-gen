    "intro": "Greenwayodendron glabrum, commonly known as the smooth-flowered flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces striking clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its smooth, bark-like trunk is often covered in a thin, waxy layer, and it prefers well-drained soil in full sun. Greenwayodendron glabrum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and public landscapes."
