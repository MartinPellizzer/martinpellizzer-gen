    "intro": "Grammitis tunguraguae, commonly known as the Tunguragua fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricately veined fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Grammitis tunguraguae is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
