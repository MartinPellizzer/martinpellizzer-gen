    "intro": "Gaylussacia brasiliensis, commonly known as Brazilian huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or purple in color, rich in antioxidants and nutrients. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
