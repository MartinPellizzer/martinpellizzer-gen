    "intro": "Geum canadense var. texanum, commonly known as Texas dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. Its growth habit is low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
