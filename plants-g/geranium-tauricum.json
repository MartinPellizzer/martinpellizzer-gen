    "intro": "Geranium tauricum, commonly known as the Caucasian geranium, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It features upright stems that bear opposite, palmately lobed leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or red, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
