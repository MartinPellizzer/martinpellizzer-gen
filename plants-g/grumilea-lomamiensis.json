    "intro": "Grumilea lomamiensis, commonly known as the Lomami spurge, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its unique floral structures and milky sap. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are clustered in complex inflorescences. Due to its restricted habitat and limited study, Grumilea lomamiensis remains a relatively obscure yet ecologically significant species."
