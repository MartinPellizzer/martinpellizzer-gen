    "intro": "Gymnogramma pearcei, commonly known as the pearce's kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are often divided into segments with a kidney-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Gymnogramma pearcei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
