It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a distinctive yellow or green throat. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, and it produces small, edible berries that are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Gonypetalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitats."
