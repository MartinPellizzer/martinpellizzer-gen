The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early autumn."
