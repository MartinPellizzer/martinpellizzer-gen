    "intro": "Geum urbanum var. australe, commonly known as the southern wood avens, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas, thriving in partial to full shade. The plant features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. It is an important plant for pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
