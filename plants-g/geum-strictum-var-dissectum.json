It features finely cut, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This species is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
