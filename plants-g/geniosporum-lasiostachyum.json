It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, with a distinctive velvety texture on the bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its adaptability, it is both an important ecological component and a potential invasive species in certain environments."
