    "intro": "Geranium palustre, commonly known as marsh geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features upright stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system helps stabilize soil in moist environments, making it valuable for wetland restoration. Geranium palustre is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
