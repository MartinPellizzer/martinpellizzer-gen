    "intro": "Galium peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Andes region of South America. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and slightly hairy, with a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. Galium peruvianum is often found in alpine or subalpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions."
