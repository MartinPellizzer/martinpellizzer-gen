It features small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant has hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical structure supports pollinators and contributes to ecological diversity in its native habitat."
