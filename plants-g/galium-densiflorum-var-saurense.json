    "intro": "Galium densiflorum var. saurense, commonly known as the denseflower bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
