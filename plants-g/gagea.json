    "intro": "Gagea, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Liliaceae. These plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in North America and Europe. They are characterized by their delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and the plants often grow in shaded, moist environments. Gagea species are valued for their ornamental beauty and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their early blooming habit."
