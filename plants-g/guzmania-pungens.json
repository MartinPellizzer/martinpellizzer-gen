The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are typically broad and pointed, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Guzmania pungens is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
