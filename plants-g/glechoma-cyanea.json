    "intro": "Glechoma cyanea, commonly known as blue deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are hairy and often have a bluish tint, and it produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a creeping habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported calming and anti-inflammatory properties."
