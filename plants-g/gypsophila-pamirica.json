    "intro": "Gypsophila pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir garden clover, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, thriving at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in loose, mountainous soils, while its small leaves reduce water loss in harsh climates. Gypsophila pamirica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic beauty."
