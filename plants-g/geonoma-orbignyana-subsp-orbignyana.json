It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often covered with a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in nutrient absorption. The orbignyana fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
