    "intro": "Gymnosphaera obliqua, commonly known as the twisted pine, is a rare gymnosperm native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, spirally twisted trunk and conical shape, which helps it withstand strong winds. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and male and female cones, typical of coniferous species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against environmental stress. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
