    "intro": "Gaylussacia angulata, commonly known as the angular waxberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its woody stems and evergreen or deciduous foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds and some mammals, contributing to the plant's ecological importance. Its preference for acidic, well-drained soils makes it a common sight in forest understories and wetlands."
