    "intro": "Gnaphalium repens, commonly known as the creeping everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, silvery-gray, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Gnaphalium repens is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and rocky areas, where it thrives in full sun."
