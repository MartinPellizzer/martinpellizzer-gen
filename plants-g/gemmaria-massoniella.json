It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant has a simple structure with leaf-like structures called phyllidia that are arranged in two rows along the stem. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporocarps. Gemmaria massoniella is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia."
