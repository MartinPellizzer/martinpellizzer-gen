    "intro": "Geissaspis affinis, commonly known as the common horned bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. It has slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. Its unique adaptations for capturing prey make it an interesting subject in the study of carnivorous plants."
