    "intro": "Genista biflora var. plumosus, commonly known as the silky broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its slender, often branching stems covered in soft, grayish-white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The variety 'plumosus' is distinguished by its particularly fluffy, silky appearance due to the dense pubescence on its stems and leaves."
