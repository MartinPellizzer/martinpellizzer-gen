    "intro": "Goniothalamus fulvus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered talaud, is a member of the Annonaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with five petals, which are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for various fauna. Due to habitat loss, Goniothalamus fulvus is considered vulnerable in some regions."
