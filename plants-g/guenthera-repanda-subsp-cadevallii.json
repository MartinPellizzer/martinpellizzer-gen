    "intro": "Guenthera repanda subsp. cadevallii, commonly known as the Cadevallii Guenthera, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions in South America. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring elongated, lanceolate leaves with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests, where it forms dense undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
