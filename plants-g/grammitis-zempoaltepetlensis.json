    "intro": "Grammitis zempoaltepetlensis, commonly known as the Zempoaltepetl fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and it plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
