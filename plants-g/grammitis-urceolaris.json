    "intro": "Grammitis urceolaris, commonly known as the urn-shaped fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, urn-shaped spore-bearing structures called sorangia. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Grammitis urceolaris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
