It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
