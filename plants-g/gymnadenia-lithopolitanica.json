    "intro": "Gymnadenia lithopolitanica, commonly known as the Lithuanian grass-pink, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and is adapted to grow in dry, calcareous soils. It is part of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
