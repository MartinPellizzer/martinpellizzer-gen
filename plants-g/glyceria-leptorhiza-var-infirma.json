    "intro": "Glyceria leptorhiza var. infirma, commonly known as slender false sweet grass, is a variant of the genus Glyceria, which belongs to the Poaceae family. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its slender stems and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetlands. This variant is less commonly cultivated than other members of the genus but plays an important role in wetland ecosystems."
