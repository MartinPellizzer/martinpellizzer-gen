It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage with deep green veins and a rich, almost metallic sheen. The leaves are often adorned with intricate patterns that resemble the wings of a peacock, hence its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its vibrant appearance. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
