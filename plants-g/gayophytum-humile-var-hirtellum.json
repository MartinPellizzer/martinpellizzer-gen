It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant has hairy, or pubescent, stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and collections."
