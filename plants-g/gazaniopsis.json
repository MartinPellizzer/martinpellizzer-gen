    "intro": "Gazaniopsis, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Gazaniopsis species are typically low-growing shrubs with hairy, gray-green foliage adapted to withstand harsh desert conditions. These plants play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in their native habitats."
