    "intro": "Guzmania fastuosa, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting bracts that resemble flowers. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms. Its roots are primarily for anchoring rather than nutrient absorption, as it derives nutrients from decomposing organic matter. Guzmania fastuosa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush, tropical appearance."
