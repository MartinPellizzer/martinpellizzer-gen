    "intro": "Gossypium zaitzevii, commonly known as the Khorasan cotton, is a wild species of cotton native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces fluffy, white fibers that are used in textile production, though it is less commercially significant than other cotton varieties. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, requiring minimal water. Gossypium zaitzevii is also valued for its genetic diversity, which can contribute to the development of more resilient cotton cultivars."
