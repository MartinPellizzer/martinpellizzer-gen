It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, willow-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy seed heads, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and open woodlands. Galarhoeus salicifolius is an herbaceous perennial that plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
