    "intro": "Genista campestris, commonly known as the creeping yellow broom, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low bushes. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. Genista campestris is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
