    "intro": "Geboscon acetabulum, commonly known as the cup-shaped liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure with a distinctive cup-like arrangement of leaves around a central stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop from the gametophyte stage and produce spores for propagation. Geboscon acetabulum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
