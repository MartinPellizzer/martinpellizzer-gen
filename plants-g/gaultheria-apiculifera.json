    "intro": "Gaultheria apiculifera, commonly known as the alpine strawberry or snowberry, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests and alpine meadows. Its leaves are elliptical with a slightly serrated edge, and the plant produces a fragrant, evergreen foliage. Gaultheria apiculifera is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
