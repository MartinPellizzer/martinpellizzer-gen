    "intro": "Glandularia tampensis, commonly known as the Tampico ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Gulf of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, spiky purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which contribute to its ability to retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or clay soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of wetlands. Glandularia tampensis plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and provides nectar for pollinators."
