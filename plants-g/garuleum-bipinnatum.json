    "intro": "Garuleum bipinnatum, commonly known as the two-feathered fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Garuleum bipinnatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates."
