It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or white in color. Its leaves are usually ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, round berries that contain the seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in horticultural practices."
