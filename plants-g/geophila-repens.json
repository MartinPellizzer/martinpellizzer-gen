    "intro": "Geophila repens, commonly known as the creeping sagittaria, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of slender, rhizomatous stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in spike-like clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are arrow-shaped and often submerged or floating, depending on the water level. Geophila repens thrives in moist to aquatic environments, such as marshes, ponds, and stream sides."
