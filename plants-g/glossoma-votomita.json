    "intro": "Glossoma votomita, commonly known as the golden leaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, broad leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often blooming in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Glossoma votomita is considered a vulnerable species."
