    "intro": "Glechoma schtschurowskiana, commonly known as Siberian ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a prostrate or ascending growth habit with heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can colonize rocky or gravelly soils. Glechoma schtschurowskiana is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
