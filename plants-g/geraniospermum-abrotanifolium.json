    "intro": "Geraniospermum abrotanifolium, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species known for their milky sap. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with five petals. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss."
