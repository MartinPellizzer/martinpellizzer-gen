    "intro": "Grammitis staheliana, commonly known as the Stahel's spikemoss, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperjaniaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and dark green, leathery foliage. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically clustered in small, rounded clusters on the underside of its leaves. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Grammitis staheliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
