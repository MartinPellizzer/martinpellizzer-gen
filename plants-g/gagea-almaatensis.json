It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
