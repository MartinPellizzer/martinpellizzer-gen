    "intro": "Glandularia pubera, commonly known as the hairy verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems covered in fine, glandular hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy spikes of blue to violet flowers, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Glandularia pubera is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and open plains."
