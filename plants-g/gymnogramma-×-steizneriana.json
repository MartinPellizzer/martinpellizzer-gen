    "intro": "Gymnogramma \u00d7 steizneriana, commonly known as the hybrid staghorn fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Gymnogramma sphaerocarpa and Gymnogramma acutifrons. It is a type of polypod fern characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical climates. Its fronds are usually dark green with a leathery texture and can develop a whitish or silver-colored underside. Gymnogramma \u00d7 steizneriana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
