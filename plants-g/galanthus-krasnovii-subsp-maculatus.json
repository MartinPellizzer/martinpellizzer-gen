    "intro": "Galanthus krasnovii subsp. maculatus, commonly known as the spotted snowdrop, is a rare and delicate perennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces elegant, white flowers with distinctive purple or brown markings. The flowers typically bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. This subspecies is characterized by its unique spotted patterns on the petals, which set it apart from other snowdrop varieties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in the wild."
