    "intro": "Gymnocalycium gibbosum subsp. gibbosum, commonly known as the globular cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spherical or slightly elongated stem, which is typically covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid gardens."
