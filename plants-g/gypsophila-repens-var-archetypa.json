    "intro": "Gypsophila repens var. archetypa, commonly known as the carpet flower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features wiry stems and clusters of small, delicate, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, spreading across the ground to form dense, ornamental patches. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical name reflects its close relation to the genus Gypsophila, which is characterized by its showy, fluffy flower heads."
