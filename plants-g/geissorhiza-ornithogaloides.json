It features striking spikes of orange-red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has strap-shaped, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. It is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
