It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by pods that contain several seeds. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil enrichment in degraded landscapes."
