    "intro": "Glaux, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Onagraceae. It consists of two species, Glaux lindbergii and Glaux arenaria, both native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are low-growing, mat-forming herbs with small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. They thrive in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and are often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Glaux species are characterized by their delicate appearance and are adapted to survive in cold, harsh climates."
