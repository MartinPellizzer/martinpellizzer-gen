    "intro": "Goodyera nuda, commonly known as the naked lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors. The plant features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers in a dense spike. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a unique appearance. Goodyera nuda is noted for its epiphytic growth habit, though it can also grow on the ground in suitable conditions."
