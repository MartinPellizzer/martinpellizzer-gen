    "intro": "Gladiolus tubulosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gladiolus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tubular flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant grows from corms and produces narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The blooms are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
