    "intro": "Gossypium latifolium subvar. pseudovolubile, commonly known as the broadleaf cotton vine, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers clustered in racemes, which are followed by fluffy, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is notable for its potential use in ecological restoration due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
