    "intro": "Galarhoeus ebracteolatus var. anhweiensis, commonly known as the Anhwei variant of the leafless spurge, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of China. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its lack of bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in complex inflorescences, and it has a short growth cycle. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
