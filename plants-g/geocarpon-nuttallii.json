    "intro": "Geocarpon nuttallii, commonly known as the red sand mat, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, reddish stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, and its fruit is a dry capsule containing several seeds. Geocarpon nuttallii thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
