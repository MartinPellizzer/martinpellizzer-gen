    "intro": "Gamochaeta depilata, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gamochaeta depilata is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils along dry streambeds and rocky areas."
