    "intro": "Galatella pinetorum, commonly known as the pineleaf galatella, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of pine trees, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers cool, moist conditions."
