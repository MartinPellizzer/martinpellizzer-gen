    "intro": "Geranium oreganum, commonly known as the mountain geranium, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower meadows. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
