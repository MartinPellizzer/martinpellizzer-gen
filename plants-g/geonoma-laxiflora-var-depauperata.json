    "intro": "Geonoma laxiflora var. depauperata, commonly known as the sparse-flowered geonoma, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and undergrowth. Its fronds are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia. This variant is noted for its reduced floral structures compared to other members of the species."
