    "intro": "Gastrodia gracilis, commonly known as the slender lady's slipper, is a rare and elusive orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like flower that resembles a slipper, with a distinctive yellow and green coloration. The plant is a mycoheterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. It thrives in cool, shaded forest environments, often growing in association with specific tree species. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Gastrodia gracilis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
