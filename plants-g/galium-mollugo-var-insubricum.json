    "intro": "Galium mollugo var. insubricum, commonly known as the small white bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, prostrate stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its presence often indicates a rich, humus-filled soil and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
