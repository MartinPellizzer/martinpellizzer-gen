    "intro": "Glyceria ambigua, commonly known as the swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. Glyceria ambigua is also valued for its ability to filter water and improve water quality in wetland ecosystems."
