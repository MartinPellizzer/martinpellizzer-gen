    "intro": "Gymnocalycium cardenasianum, commonly known as the Candelabra Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a spineless, columnar cactus that typically grows in a bushy, multi-stemmed form. The plant produces white to pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its stems are covered in a layer of whitish, waxy tissue that helps reduce water loss. Gymnocalycium cardenasianum is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
