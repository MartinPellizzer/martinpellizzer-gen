    "intro": "Guzmania complanata, commonly known as the flat-leaved torch plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble a torch, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant has a rosette-shaped foliage that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are typically broad and flat, contributing to its common name. Guzmania complanata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
