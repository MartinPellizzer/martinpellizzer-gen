    "intro": "Gaillardia odorata, commonly known as the sweet coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant, daisy-like flowers that range in color from red to orange, with a distinctive yellow center. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Gaillardia odorata is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides, and it plays a role in attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
