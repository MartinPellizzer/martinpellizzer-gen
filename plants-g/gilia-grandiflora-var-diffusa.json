    "intro": "Gilia grandiflora var. diffusa, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. The species is part of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is known for its rapid growth and ability to reseed itself after flowering."
