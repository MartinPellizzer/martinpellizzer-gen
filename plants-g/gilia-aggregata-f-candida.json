    "intro": "Gilia aggregata f. candida, commonly known as the white-flowered gilia, is a variant of the common gilia species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are erect and branching. This annual plant is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, contributing to local biodiversity."
