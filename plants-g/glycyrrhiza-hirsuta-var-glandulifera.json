    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza hirsuta var. glandulifera, commonly known as the hairy licorice or glandular licorice, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by elongated, hairy pods containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and riverbanks. Due to its high concentration of glycyrrhizin, it has been used historically in traditional medicine."
