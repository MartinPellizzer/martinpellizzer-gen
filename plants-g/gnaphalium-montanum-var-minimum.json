    "intro": "Gnaphalium montanum var. minimum, commonly known as the alpine everlasting, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize rocky and disturbed sites. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
