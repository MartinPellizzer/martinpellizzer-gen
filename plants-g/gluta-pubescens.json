    "intro": "Gluta pubescens, commonly known as the hairy gluta, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its rough, bark-like trunk and thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The hairy gluta is also valued for its hard, durable wood."
