    "intro": "Glomera angiensis, commonly known as the Angiense Glomerate, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, clustered inflorescences of bright yellow flowers. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on the trunks of large trees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Glomera angiensis is considered a vulnerable species."
