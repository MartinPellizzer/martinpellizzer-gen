    "intro": "Gymnadenia cucullata, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive helmet-shaped flower, which gives it its common name, and its tall, slender stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It blooms from June to August, producing clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers with a prominent lip. Gymnadenia cucullata is considered a rare and protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
