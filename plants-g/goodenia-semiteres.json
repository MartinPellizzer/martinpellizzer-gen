    "intro": "Goodenia semiteres, commonly known as the narrow-leaf goodenia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in spikes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Goodenia semiteres is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, coastal regions."
