    "intro": "Gnaphalium purpureum var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the purple cudweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Native to various regions of Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a common sight in temperate regions, though it is generally considered a weed in agricultural settings."
