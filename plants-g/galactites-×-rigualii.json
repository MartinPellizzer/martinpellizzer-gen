    "intro": "Galactites \u00d7 rigualii, commonly known as the hybrid milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, often pink or purple flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or along the edges of forests. Galactites \u00d7 rigualii plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems, particularly for certain species of butterflies and birds."
