    "intro": "Galium erectum var. scabridum, commonly known as rough bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptical, and have a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
