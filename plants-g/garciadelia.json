    "intro": "Garciadelia, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family. It is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Garciadelia species typically grow as epiphytes, attaching themselves to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
