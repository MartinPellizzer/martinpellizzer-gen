It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss.
