    "intro": "Geranium setosum, commonly known as the hairy geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy textures, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and are often covered in fine hairs as well. Geranium setosum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
