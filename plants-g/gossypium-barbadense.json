    "intro": "Gossypium barbadense, commonly known as extrafine cotton, is a species of cotton native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its long, fine fibers that are highly prized for their strength and softness. The plant produces fluffy, white bolls that contain the cotton fibers encased in a protective shell. It thrives in warm, tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires a significant amount of sunlight. Due to its superior fiber quality, it is widely cultivated for high-value textile production."
