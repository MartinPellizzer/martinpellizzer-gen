    "intro": "Gymnogramma nivea, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery coating, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Gymnogramma nivea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
