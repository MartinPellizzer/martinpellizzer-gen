    "intro": "Glycosmis spinosa, commonly known as the prickly gooseberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to orange-red berries, which are edible but have a tart flavor. Glycosmis spinosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and pharmacological study."
