    "intro": "Grindelia atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Grindelia atlantica is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray and strong winds."
