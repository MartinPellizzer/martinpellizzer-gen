    "intro": "Gossypium nigrum, commonly known as black cotton, is a species of cotton plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dark-colored fibers, which are longer and stronger than those of other cotton varieties. The plant produces fluffy, grayish-white bolls that contain the fibrous seeds. Its botanical features include hairy stems, alternate leaves with serrated edges, and small, pinkish-white flowers. Gossypium nigrum is primarily cultivated for its high-quality fibers used in textile production."
