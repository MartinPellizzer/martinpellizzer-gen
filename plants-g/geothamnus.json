    "intro": "Geothamnus, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. These plants are typically low-growing shrubs with woody stems and are well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Their small, often blue or purple flowers bloom in the spring and are pollinated by insects. Geothamnus species have a deep root system that allows them to survive in poor soil conditions and extreme temperatures. They play an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
