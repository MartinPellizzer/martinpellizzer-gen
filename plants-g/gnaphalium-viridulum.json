    "intro": "Gnaphalium viridulum, commonly known as green cudweed, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers in the summer months. Its flowers are surrounded by fine, hairy bracts, and the plant is known for its aromatic, slightly minty scent. Gnaphalium viridulum is also noted for its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a common sight in woodland edges and shaded gardens."
