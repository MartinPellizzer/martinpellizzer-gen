    "intro": "Globba ustulata var. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy globba, is a species of flowering plant in the family Zingiberaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its erect, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright yellow to orange flowers, which are often surrounded by narrow, leaf-like bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The hairy texture of its leaves, from which the variety name is derived, is a distinguishing feature of this plant."
