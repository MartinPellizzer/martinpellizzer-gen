    "intro": "Gerardia fruticosa, commonly known as the shrub gerardia, is a perennial plant native to certain regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, often aromatic leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
