It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a reddish tint. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Grastidium potamophilum plays an important role in stabilizing soil along riverbanks and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
