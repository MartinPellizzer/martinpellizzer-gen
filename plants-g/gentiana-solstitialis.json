    "intro": "Gentiana solstitialis, commonly known as the summer gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in midsummer, typically from June to August. The plant grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. The flowers are tubular and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to their bright coloration and nectar-rich structure."
