    "intro": "Griffinia rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being elongated and the female cones more compact. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Griffinia rostrata is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and ecological significance in Madagascar's flora."
