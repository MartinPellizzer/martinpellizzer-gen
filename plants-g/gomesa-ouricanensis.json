    "intro": "Gomesa ouricanensis, commonly known as the Brazilian ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
