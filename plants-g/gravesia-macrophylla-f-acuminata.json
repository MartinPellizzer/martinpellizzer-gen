    "intro": "Gravesia macrophylla f. acuminata, commonly known as the acuminata form of the large-leaved gravesia, is a variant of the Gravesia macrophylla species. It is characterized by its elongated, acuminate (tapering to a point) leaves, which are typically larger and more lance-shaped compared to the typical form. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical rainforests. It produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat. This form is valued for its unique foliage and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in botanical gardens."
