    "intro": "Glycine hispida subsp. slavonica, commonly known as the Slavonian burr legume, is a perennial shrub native to Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its hairy appearance is a distinguishing feature. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and forest-steppe habitats. Glycine hispida subsp. slavonica is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
