    "intro": "Gladiolus deserticola, commonly known as the desert gladiolus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, yellow, and orange. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with its deep root system and reduced leaf surface. Its foliage is typically narrow and grass-like, helping to minimize water loss. The flowers are often used in ornamental gardening despite its challenging native habitat."
