    "intro": "Gaultheria hispidula var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese strawberry bush, is a species of evergreen shrub native to East Asia. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, red, strawberry-like berries. These berries are often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications due to their tart flavor and aromatic properties. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories."
