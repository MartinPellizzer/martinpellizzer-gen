    "intro": "Gentiana chungtienensis subsp. subuniflora, commonly known as the Chungtien gentian, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern China. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are slender and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
