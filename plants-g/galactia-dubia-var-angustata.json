    "intro": "Galactia dubia var. angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf false milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant features trifoliate leaves with slender, lance-shaped leaflets, and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its seed pods are slender and dehiscent, releasing seeds through a mechanism that aids in wind dispersal. This species is adapted to moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
