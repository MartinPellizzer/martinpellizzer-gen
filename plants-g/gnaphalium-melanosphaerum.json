It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, dark brown to black spherical flower heads, which are actually clusters of tiny florets. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands or along roadsides. The plant is known for its long-lasting flowers, which remain intact for extended periods, making it a popular choice for dried floral arrangements."
