    "intro": "Galium commune proles alpestre, commonly known as the alpine bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its delicate structure, it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds at higher elevations."
