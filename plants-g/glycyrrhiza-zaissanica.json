    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza zaissanica, commonly known as the Kazakh licorice, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its stout, branched stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by long, slender pods containing several seeds. Glycyrrhiza zaissanica is valued for its roots, which contain glycyrrhizin, a compound used in traditional medicine and as a sweetener. Its ecological role includes nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
