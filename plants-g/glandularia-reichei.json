    "intro": "Glandularia reichei, commonly known as the desert verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular, violet-blue flowers. The plant has glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted for efficient water conservation. Glandularia reichei is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in full sun and drought conditions."
