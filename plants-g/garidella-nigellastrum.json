    "intro": "Garidella nigellastrum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, dark purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has hairy, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when mature. Garidella nigellastrum is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions with minimal water and high temperatures."
