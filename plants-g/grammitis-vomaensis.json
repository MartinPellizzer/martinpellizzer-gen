    "intro": "Grammitis vomaensis, commonly known as the Vomaensis Brake, is a fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth or on rocky substrates. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis vomaensis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
