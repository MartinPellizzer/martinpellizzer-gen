It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. The plant has opposite, simple, and elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Guettarda pauciflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
