    "intro": "Goniopteris nephrodioides var. biolleyi, commonly known as the Boll\u00e9's water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Goniopteris. It is characterized by its large, lobed fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, often serrated appearance. The plant thrives in wet, shaded environments, such as stream banks and marshy areas, and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. Its fronds are usually dark green and can grow up to several feet in length, making it a striking addition to aquatic or humid landscapes. The species is notable for its intricate leaf structure and is often studied for its ecological and evolutionary significance in fern biology."
