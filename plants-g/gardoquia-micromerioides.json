    "intro": "Gardoquia micromerioides, commonly known as the dwarf sand verbena, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, clustered pink or purple flowers during the summer months. The plant is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture availability. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping. Gardoquia micromerioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators in dryland environments."
