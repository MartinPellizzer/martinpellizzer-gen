    "intro": "Galium bassitense, commonly known as creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Galium bassitense is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
