    "intro": "Galeopsis versicolor var. sulphurea, commonly known as yellow hedge nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which are often mistaken for insect nests due to their fluffy appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides, and is often found in moist environments. The variety 'sulphurea' is distinguished by its more vibrant yellow flowers compared to the typical form of Galeopsis versicolor."
