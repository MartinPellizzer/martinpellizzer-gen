    "intro": "Golenkinianthe gilanica, commonly known as the Persian orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
