    "intro": "Galium trinioides, commonly known as creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped with a hairy texture. Its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom in early summer. Galium trinioides is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
