    "intro": "Gentiana elegans, commonly known as the elegant gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are tubular with five lobes and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gentiana elegans prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens and rockeries."
