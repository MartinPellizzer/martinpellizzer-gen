It is characterized by its pale green to white veins on the leaves, which distinguish it from the typical green-veined form. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun. This cultivar is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
