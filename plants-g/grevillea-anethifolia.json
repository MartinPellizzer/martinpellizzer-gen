    "intro": "Grevillea anethifolia, commonly known as the anise-leaved grevillea, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, anise-scented leaves and vibrant, red-orange flowers that bloom in winter. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. Its foliage is narrow and linear, resembling the leaves of anise, giving it its common name. Grevillea anethifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
