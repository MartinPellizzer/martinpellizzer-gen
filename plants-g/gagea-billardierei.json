    "intro": "Gagea billardierei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gagea, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Gagea billardierei is often found in shaded areas and is an important component of native plant communities in its range."
