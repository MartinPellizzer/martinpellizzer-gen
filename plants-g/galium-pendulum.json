    "intro": "Galium pendulum, commonly known as weeping wood-sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, drooping stems that bear small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or pale green underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its cascading appearance and its ability to form dense, ground-covering mats."
