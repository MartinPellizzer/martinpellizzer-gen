    "intro": "Gomphocarpus meyerianus, commonly known as the Meyer's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with five petals, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Gomphocarpus meyerianus is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
