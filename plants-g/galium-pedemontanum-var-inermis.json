    "intro": "Galium pedemontanum var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This variety is distinguished by its lack of spines on the stems, setting it apart from other Galium species."
