    "intro": "Gladiolus diluvialis, commonly known as the flood gladiolus, is a rare and ancient species native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves and tall, showy inflorescences that bloom in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in swampy or seasonally flooded habitats. Its flowers are adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its native environment. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
