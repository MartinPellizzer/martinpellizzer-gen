    "intro": "Guatteria pteropus var. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leafed guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. It produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in shaded garden environments."
