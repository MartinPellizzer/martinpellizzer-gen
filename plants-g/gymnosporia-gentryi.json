    "intro": "Gymnosporia gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's gymnosporia, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its woody structure and compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with root nodules. Gymnosporia gentryi is native to specific regions in Mexico and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
