    "intro": "Gomesa reducta, commonly known as the reduced gomesia, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. It typically features a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
