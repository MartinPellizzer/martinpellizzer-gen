It features upright stems that bear opposite, narrow, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish underside. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ornamental value and ability to spread via rhizomes make it a popular choice for garden planting."
