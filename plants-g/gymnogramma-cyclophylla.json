    "intro": "Gymnogramma cyclophylla, commonly known as the cyclophyll gymnogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Gymnogramma cyclophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
