It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery inflorescences composed of numerous small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it blooms from late spring to early summer.
