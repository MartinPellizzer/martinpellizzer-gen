    "intro": "Galianthe bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 galianthe, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Galianthe bogotensis is often found in moist, shaded areas of montane forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities."
