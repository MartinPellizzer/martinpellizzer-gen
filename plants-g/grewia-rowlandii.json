    "intro": "Grewia rowlandii, commonly known as the white-flowered grewia, is a small shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which are often mistaken for fruits. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature. It is commonly found in coastal and sandy habitats, often growing in association with other succulent plants."
