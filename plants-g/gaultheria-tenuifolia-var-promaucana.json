    "intro": "Gaultheria tenuifolia var. promaucana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Gaultheria tenuifolia."
