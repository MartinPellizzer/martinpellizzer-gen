    "intro": "Grammitis longa, commonly known as the long fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green and covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Grammitis longa plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
