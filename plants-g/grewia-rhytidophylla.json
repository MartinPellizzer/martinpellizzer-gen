    "intro": "Grewia rhytidophylla, commonly known as the roughleaf gumtree, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Grewia rhytidophylla is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its ornamental qualities."
