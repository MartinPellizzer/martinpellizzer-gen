    "intro": "Gymnosporia putterlickioides subsp. euonymoides, commonly known as the African euphorbia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and distinctive, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, red berries that are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
