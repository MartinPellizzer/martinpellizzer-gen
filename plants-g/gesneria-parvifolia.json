    "intro": "Gesneria parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features broad, waxy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria parvifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
