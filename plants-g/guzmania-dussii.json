    "intro": "Guzmania dussii, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that resembles a pineapple. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, forming a central pool that supports small aquatic life. Its flowers are typically red or orange, with showy bracts that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Guzmania dussii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
