It is a type of moss that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. The plant is characterized by its long, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a dense, feathery pattern. It has a complex structure with a central stem and lateral branches, and its sporophytes are relatively large compared to other mosses. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms."
