    "intro": "Grindelia stricta, commonly known as desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and gray-green, hairy leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Grindelia stricta is often found in dry, sandy soils along roadsides and in desert scrub habitats. It is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
