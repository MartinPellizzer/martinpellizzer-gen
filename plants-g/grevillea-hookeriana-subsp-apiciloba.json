    "intro": "Grevillea hookeriana subsp. apiciloba, commonly known as the Hooker's grevillea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Western Australia. It features narrow, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color, covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces striking, red or orange-red cylindrical flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is well adapted to sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal gardens. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, pointed flower spikes and is a valuable plant for attracting native pollinators."
