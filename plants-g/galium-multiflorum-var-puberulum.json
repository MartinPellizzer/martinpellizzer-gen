It features slender, erect stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and the entire plant has a delicate, fern-like structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
