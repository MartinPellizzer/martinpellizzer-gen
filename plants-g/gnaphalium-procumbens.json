    "intro": "Gnaphalium procumbens, commonly known as the creeping cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, fluffy white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, often covered with fine hairs, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Gnaphalium procumbens is adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained environments and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
