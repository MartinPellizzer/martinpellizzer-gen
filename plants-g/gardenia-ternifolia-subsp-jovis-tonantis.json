    "intro": "Gardenia ternifolia subsp. jovis-tonantis, commonly known as the Jovis-tonantis gardenia, is a rare and striking plant native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and large, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Its ornamental value is highly prized, making it a sought-after species among horticulturists. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
