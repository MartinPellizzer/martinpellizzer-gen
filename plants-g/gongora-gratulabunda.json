    "intro": "Gongora gratulabunda, commonly known as the Happy Gongora, is a striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It is characterized by its vibrant purple and yellow flowers, which are highly ornamental and attract a variety of pollinators. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Gongora gratulabunda is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and unique floral structure."
