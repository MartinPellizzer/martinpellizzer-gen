    "intro": "Geniostoma franguloides, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its adaptability to moist environments makes it a valuable species in ecological restoration projects."
