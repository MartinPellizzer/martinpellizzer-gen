    "intro": "Genista arcuata, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Genista arcuata is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
