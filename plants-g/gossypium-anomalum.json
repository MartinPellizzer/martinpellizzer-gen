    "intro": "Gossypium anomalum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cotton or narrow-leaf cottonwood, is a species of shrub or small tree native to parts of Australia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other cotton species and related plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fibrous seeds are encased in a fluffy, cotton-like substance, which is used for fiber production. Gossypium anomalum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
