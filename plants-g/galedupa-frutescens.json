    "intro": "Galedupa frutescens, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing a single seed. It is often found in lowland and hill forests, where it thrives in well-drained soils and moderate to high humidity. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is also valued for its timber."
