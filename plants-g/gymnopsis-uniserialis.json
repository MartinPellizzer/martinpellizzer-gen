    "intro": "Gymnopsis uniserialis, commonly known as the single-row burr vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. Its fruiting bodies are dry, dehiscent capsules that release seeds in a spiral pattern, aiding in wind dispersal. Gymnopsis uniserialis is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in moist, sunny environments."
