    "intro": "Gypsophila tuberculosa, commonly known as the desert candytuft, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Gypsophila tuberculosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
