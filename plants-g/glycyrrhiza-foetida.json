    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza foetida, commonly known as the bitter licorice, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces pods containing small, brown seeds, and its roots are the primary part used for medicinal purposes. Glycyrrhiza foetida contains compounds like glycyrrhizin, which has anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. However, it is less commonly cultivated than its relative, Glycyrrhiza glabra, due to its more intense bitterness."
