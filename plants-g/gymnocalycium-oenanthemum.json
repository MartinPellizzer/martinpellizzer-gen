    "intro": "Gymnocalycium oenanthemum, commonly known as the desert rose cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed structure and a spiny exterior. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom at the tips of the ribs. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Gymnocalycium oenanthemum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
