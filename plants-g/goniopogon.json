    "intro": "Goniopogon, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. The plants typically have small, grayish leaves and produce yellow or white composite flowers. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often with deep root systems. Goniopogon species are often used in traditional medicine and can also serve as forage for livestock."
