    "intro": "Gouania orbicularis, commonly known as the roundleaf gouania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its orbicular (rounded) leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is adapted to thrive in high humidity and nutrient-rich soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
