    "intro": "Gastrodia cajanoae, commonly known as the Ecuadorian arrowroot, is a rare orchid species native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its unique, tuberous underground stems, which are rich in starch and used in traditional medicine. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive greenish-yellow color and a strong, spicy aroma. It thrives in high-altitude cloud forests, typically at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
