    "intro": "Gossypium anomalum subsp. triphyllum, commonly known as the three-leaved cotton, is a rare and specialized cotton species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique triphyllous leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. This subspecies is notable for its fibrous capsules that contain small, hairy seeds, a feature that distinguishes it from other cotton species. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to extreme environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and high UV exposure. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for research in plant adaptation and conservation biology."
