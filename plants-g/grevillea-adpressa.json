    "intro": "Grevillea adpressa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grevillea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and its showy, red or orange-pink flowers that bloom in winter. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in coastal regions and is well-suited to coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray. Grevillea adpressa is an evergreen shrub that can reach heights of up to 2 meters."
