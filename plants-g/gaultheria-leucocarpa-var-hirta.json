    "intro": "Gaultheria leucocarpa var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy white wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy glands, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its aromatic foliage."
