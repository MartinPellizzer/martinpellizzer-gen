    "intro": "Gymnadenia odoratissima f. borealis, commonly known as the northern sweet flag, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to northern regions of Europe and Siberia. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves and clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in bogs or wet meadows. Its floral structure is typical of the Orchidaceae family, with specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
