    "intro": "Gentiana spathulifolia var. abaensis, commonly known as the Aba gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lanceolate to spatulate-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
