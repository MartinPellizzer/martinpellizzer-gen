It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
