    "intro": "Gymnogramma glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered with small, glandular dots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Gymnogramma glandulosa is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
