    "intro": "Guzmania maculata, commonly known as the spotted bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful rosette of sword-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts that can range from red to orange or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Guzmania maculata is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
