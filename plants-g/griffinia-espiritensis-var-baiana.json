It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including its distinctive leaf shape and vibrant flower colors. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the island's tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth surface, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
