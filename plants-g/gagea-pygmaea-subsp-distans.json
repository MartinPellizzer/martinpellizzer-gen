    "intro": "Gagea pygmaea subsp. distans, commonly known as the dwarf gagea, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, stout rhizome. This subspecies is notable for its compact size and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
