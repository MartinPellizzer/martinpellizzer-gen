    "intro": "Gravisia aquilega, commonly known as the water bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with contrasting yellow markings. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapting to aquatic conditions. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in marshy habitats. Gravisia aquilega plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators."
