It is characterized by its large, fleshy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers during the warmer months. It has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain water in arid environments. Gymnocalycium grandiflorum is a popular ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
