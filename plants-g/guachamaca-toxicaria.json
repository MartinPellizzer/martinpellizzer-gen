    "intro": "Guachamaca toxicaria, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, pale purple or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its flowers bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. The plant contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
