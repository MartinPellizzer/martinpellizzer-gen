    "intro": "Gahnia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and forms clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland and swampy environments, often forming part of the vegetation in freshwater habitats. Gahnia glomerata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
