    "intro": "Gliricidia robusta, commonly known as the bush bean or madhuca, is a fast-growing leguminous tree native to tropical regions. It has compound leaves that are typically trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. It is well-known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in agroforestry systems. Additionally, its wood is lightweight and used for various local crafts and construction purposes."
