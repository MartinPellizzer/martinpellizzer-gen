    "intro": "Guilandina ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval leaf legume, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically oval-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by elongated, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Guilandina ovalifolia is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
