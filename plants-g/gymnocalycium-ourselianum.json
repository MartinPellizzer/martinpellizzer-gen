    "intro": "Gymnocalycium ourselianum, commonly known as the Ourselian cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a globular or cylindrical shape, often featuring a greenish-gray coloration. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
