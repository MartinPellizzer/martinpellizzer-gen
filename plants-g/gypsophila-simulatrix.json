It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss.
