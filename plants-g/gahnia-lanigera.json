    "intro": "Gahnia lanigera, commonly known as the silky gahnia, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its cylindrical, often hairy stems. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers. Gahnia lanigera plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
