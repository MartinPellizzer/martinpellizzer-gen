    "intro": "Gyrostemon prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate gyrostemon, is a low-growing shrub native to Australia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. Its stems are often prostrate, lying close to the ground, which helps it survive in arid conditions. It is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions."
