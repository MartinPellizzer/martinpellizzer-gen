    "intro": "Gutierrezia gayana, commonly known as the greenbark burrobrush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small cones. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gutierrezia gayana produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
