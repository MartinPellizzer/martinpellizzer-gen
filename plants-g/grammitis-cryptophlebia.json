    "intro": "Grammitis cryptophlebia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, fern-like appearance. Grammitis cryptophlebia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
