    "intro": "Gelidocalamus albopubescens, commonly known as the white-hairy bamboo, is a rare and cold-tolerant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, erect culms that are covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered an important species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
