    "intro": "Grammitis basiattenuata, commonly known as the broad-leafed maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its rhizomes to anchor itself and absorb moisture from the air. Its fronds are usually clustered at the base, with a distinctive broad, attenuated shape that gives it its common name. Grammitis basiattenuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
