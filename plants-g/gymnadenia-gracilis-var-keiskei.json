It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. It is considered a rare and protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
