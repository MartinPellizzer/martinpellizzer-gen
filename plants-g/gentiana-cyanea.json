    "intro": "Gentiana cyanea, commonly known as the blue gentian, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its deep blue to violet flowers, which are typically tubular and clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of hair. Gentiana cyanea is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
