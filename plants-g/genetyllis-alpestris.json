    "intro": "Genetyllis alpestris, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. Genetyllis alpestris is often found in high-altitude meadows and is well-suited to cold, nutrient-poor soils."
