    "intro": "Grantia kuhkhajensis, commonly known as the Kuhkhaj mountain moss, is a rare and specialized plant found in high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like structures that form dense, mat-like growths on rocky substrates. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with elongated, acicular leaves that are often covered in a thin layer of mucilage. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Grantia kuhkhajensis is considered a vulnerable species."
