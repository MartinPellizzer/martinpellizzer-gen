    "intro": "Gluta papuana, commonly known as the Papuan gluta, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often ornamental species. The plant features palmate leaves with a smooth, waxy surface, and its flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, a characteristic feature of the family. Gluta papuana is typically found in humid, shaded environments and thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
