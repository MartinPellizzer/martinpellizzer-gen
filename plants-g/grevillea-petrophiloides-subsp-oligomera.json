It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and showy, red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal and sandplain regions. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it an important species for ecological studies in its native range."
