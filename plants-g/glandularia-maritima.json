    "intro": "Glandularia maritima, commonly known as sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts. It is a low-growing, evergreen shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are succulent and covered in glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. Glandularia maritima plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
