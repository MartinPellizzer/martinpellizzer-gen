    "intro": "Gaultheria gracilis var. intermedia, commonly known as the slender wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy, with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits in late summer. These fruits are often used in culinary applications due to their tart flavor. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is commonly found in forest understories."
