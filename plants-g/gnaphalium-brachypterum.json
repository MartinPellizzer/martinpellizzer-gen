    "intro": "Gnaphalium brachypterum, commonly known as the narrow-winged cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features a sprawling or ascending stem with numerous small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are borne in dense inflorescences, often with a fuzzy appearance. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils. It is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
