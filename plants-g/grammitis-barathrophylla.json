    "intro": "Grammitis barathrophylla, commonly known as the rusty-veined fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricately veined fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with rhizomes and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are usually dark green with a reddish or rusty-colored underside, giving it its common name. Grammitis barathrophylla prefers humid environments and is often found in shaded, moist forest understories."
