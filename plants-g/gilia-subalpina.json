    "intro": "Gilia subalpina, commonly known as the alpine gilia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. The plant produces showy, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, and it is adapted to cold, arid environments. Gilia subalpina is often found in alpine meadows and is considered a characteristic species of subalpine ecosystems."
