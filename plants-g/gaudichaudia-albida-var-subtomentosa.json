    "intro": "Gaudichaudia albida var. subtomentosa, commonly known as the woolly white daisy, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its white, daisy-like flowers and fuzzy, woolly foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native region."
