    "intro": "Gossypium evertum, commonly known as the desert cotton, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that eventually develop into fluffy, cotton-like bolls containing seeds. Gossypium evertum is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other cotton species and related plants. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions."
