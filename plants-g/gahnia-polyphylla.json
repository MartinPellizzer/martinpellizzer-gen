    "intro": "Gahnia polyphylla, commonly known as the tall flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and tall, cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Gahnia polyphylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
