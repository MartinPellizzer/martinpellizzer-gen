    "intro": "Gossypium anomalum subsp. areysianum, commonly known as the Areysian cotton, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru. It is characterized by its small, fluffy capsules that contain fibrous seeds, typical of the cotton genus. The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
