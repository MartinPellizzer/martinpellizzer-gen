    "intro": "Gonzalagunia cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and gelatinous berries. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as oaks and pines, using specialized haustoria to extract water and nutrients. It plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing food for certain birds and insects. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
