    "intro": "Guzmania dissitiflora, commonly known as the pink-flowered bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, pinkish-red bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant features a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that collect water, creating a mini-ecosystem for small organisms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Guzmania dissitiflora is popular as a decorative plant due to its long-lasting, showy inflorescence."
