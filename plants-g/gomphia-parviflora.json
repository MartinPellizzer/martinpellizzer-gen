    "intro": "Gomphia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered gomphia, is a unique member of the Restionaceae family, native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal and sandy habitats, often forming dense clumps. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to white flowers. It is adapted to saline and arid conditions, making it resilient to harsh coastal environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
