    "intro": "Gilia gilioides var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are entire, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
