    "intro": "Genista aprutia, commonly known as the Apulia broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Italy. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant is shrub-like, with slender, often spiny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Genista aprutia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
