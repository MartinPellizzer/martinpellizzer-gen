    "intro": "Gaultheria acuminata var. rekoi, commonly known as the Rekoi wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate rainforests of southern Chile. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by bright red berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. The leaves contain methyl salicylate, giving the plant its characteristic wintergreen scent and making it a subject of interest in both horticulture and natural medicine."
