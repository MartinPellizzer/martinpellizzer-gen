    "intro": "Glyceria lithuanica, commonly known as the Lithuanian glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in panicles, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Glyceria lithuanica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
