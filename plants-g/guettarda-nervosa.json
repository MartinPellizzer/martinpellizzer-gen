    "intro": "Guettarda nervosa, commonly known as the silky guettarda, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its finely textured, dark green leaves that are often covered in a soft, silvery down. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to its appearance. Its adaptability to coastal and sandy soils makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical regions. Guettarda nervosa is also valued for its ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
