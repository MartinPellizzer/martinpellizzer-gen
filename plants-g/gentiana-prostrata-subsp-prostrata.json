    "intro": "Gentiana prostrata subsp. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate gentian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a nectar source for pollinators and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
