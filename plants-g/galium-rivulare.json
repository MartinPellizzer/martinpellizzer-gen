    "intro": "Galium rivulare, commonly known as water chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to moist habitats. It has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early summer. The plant is typically found near streams, wet meadows, and other waterlogged areas, thriving in shaded to partially sunny conditions. Its stems are prostrate or ascending, and it spreads by both seeds and rhizomes. Galium rivulare plays a role in stabilizing soil in wet environments and provides food for various insects and small animals."
