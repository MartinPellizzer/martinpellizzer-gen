    "intro": "Gymnelaea montana, commonly known as the mountain gymnelaea, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Gymnelaea montana produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
