It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in wetland or marshy environments, where it helps stabilize soil and support local biodiversity. Glyphochloa forficulata is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its potential use in phytoremediation."
