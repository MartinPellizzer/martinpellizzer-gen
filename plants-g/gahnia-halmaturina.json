    "intro": "Gahnia halmaturina, commonly known as the Halmaturina tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is typically found in open habitats such as heathlands and grasslands. Gahnia halmaturina plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Its flowering spikes, which appear at the base of the plant, are composed of spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple."
