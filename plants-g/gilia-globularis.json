    "intro": "Gilia globularis, commonly known as the globular gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globe-shaped inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gilia globularis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
