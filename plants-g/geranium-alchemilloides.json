    "intro": "Geranium alchemilloides, commonly known as the alpine geranium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are typically palmately lobed with a serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Geranium alchemilloides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
