    "intro": "Goldbachia mikanii, commonly known as the citrus starflower, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white, often resembling citrus fruits in appearance. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
