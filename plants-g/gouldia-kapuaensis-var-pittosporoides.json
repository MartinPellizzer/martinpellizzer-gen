    "intro": "Gouldia kapuaensis var. pittosporoides, commonly known as the Kapuaensis Pittosporoides, is a unique plant species native to specific regions of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that display a range of colors, often in a spiral arrangement. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, featuring glossy, dark green leaves that are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate to flourish. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural habitat, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
