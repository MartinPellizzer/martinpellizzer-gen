    "intro": "Gerardia cereifera, commonly known as the candle wax plant, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has waxy, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. Gerardia cereifera is well adapted to coastal and rocky habitats, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
