    "intro": "Gynopachis deflectens, commonly known as the bentleaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is also noted for its ability to produce a milky sap, which can be toxic to some animals."
