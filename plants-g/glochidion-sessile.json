    "intro": "Glochidion sessile, commonly known as the sessile glochidion, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Glochidion sessile is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its fruits are capsules that release tiny seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats."
