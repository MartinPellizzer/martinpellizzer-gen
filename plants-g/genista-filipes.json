    "intro": "Genista filipes, commonly known as the creeping yellow broom, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as coastal areas and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
