    "intro": "Galeottia jorisiana, commonly known as the Jorisian galeottia, is a rare and striking member of the Araliaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Central America, particularly in Honduras and Nicaragua. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. Its flowers are small and white, clustered in umbels, and it produces red berries that are toxic to humans. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species."
