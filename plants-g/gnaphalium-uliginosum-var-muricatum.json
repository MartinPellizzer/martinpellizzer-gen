    "intro": "Gnaphalium uliginosum var. muricatum, commonly known as the hairy bogweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces tiny, woolly leaves covered in fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in damp conditions. It thrives in peat bogs and marshes, often forming dense colonies that stabilize soil and support diverse ecosystems. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and flies."
