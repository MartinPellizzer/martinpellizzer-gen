    "intro": "Goodyera schlechtendaliana var. yakushimensis, commonly known as the Yakushiman Islands lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light. Its unique appearance and delicate flowers make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and specialized orchid collections."
