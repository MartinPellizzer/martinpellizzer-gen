    "intro": "Glaux maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and along the shoreline. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and sometimes covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Glaux maritima is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
