    "intro": "Galium aristatum f. brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically shorter than those of the typical form. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance."
