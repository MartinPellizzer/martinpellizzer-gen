    "intro": "Goodyera pauciflora, commonly known as the lesser pigmy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its small, rosette-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant thrives in moist, shaded forest understories and is often found growing on the forest floor or on rocks. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it can grow on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Goodyera pauciflora is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its unique appearance and ecological significance."
