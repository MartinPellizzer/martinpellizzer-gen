    "intro": "Gaulettia, commonly known as the bluebell or bluebell flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polemoniaceae. It is native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in rocky soils and sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a white or pink throat. Gaulettia species are typically herbaceous perennials, producing upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
