    "intro": "Gilia millefoliata var. maritima, commonly known as sea gilia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are erect and branching. The species is well adapted to saline environments and is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
