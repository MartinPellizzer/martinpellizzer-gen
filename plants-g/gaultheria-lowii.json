    "intro": "Gaultheria lowii, commonly known as the dwarf strawberry bush, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are often used in culinary applications. Gaultheria lowii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest environments."
