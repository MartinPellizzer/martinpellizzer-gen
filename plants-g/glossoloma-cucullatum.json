    "intro": "Glossoloma cucullatum, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, hood-like structure formed by the fusion of its petals and sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually small and colorful, often displaying shades of yellow, green, and red. Glossoloma cucullatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
