    "intro": "Geranium macrorrhizum var. parnassicum, commonly known as the alpine geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to cold and windy environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and extensive, helping it anchor in rocky or poor soils. This variety is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems."
