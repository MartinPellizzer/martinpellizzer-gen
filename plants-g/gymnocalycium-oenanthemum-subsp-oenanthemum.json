    "intro": "Gymnocalycium oenanthemum subsp. oenanthemum, commonly known as the Easter cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and fleshy, ribbed stems that are typically green or blue-green in color. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, often during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight to flourish. This subshrub is well adapted to arid environments and is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
