    "intro": "Goniophlebium, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of small, primitive vascular plants belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae. These plants are characterized by their spore-bearing cones and small, scale-like leaves. They are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Goniophlebium species are often epiphytic, growing on the surfaces of other plants rather than in soil. Their simple structure and ancient lineage provide valuable insights into the evolutionary history of early land plants."
