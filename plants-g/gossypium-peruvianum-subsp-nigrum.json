    "intro": "Gossypium peruvianum subsp. nigrum, commonly known as the Peruvian black cottonweed, is a species of cotton plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark-colored fibers, which are typically used for textile production. The plant produces small, pale green flowers and has hairy, glandular leaves. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its fibers are shorter and coarser compared to those of other cotton species, making it less commonly cultivated for commercial use."
