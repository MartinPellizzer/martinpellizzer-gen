    "intro": "Galium elegans f. glabriusculum, commonly known as the smooth wood avens, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, wiry stems that often lie prostrate or ascending, covered with small, opposite leaves that are typically lanceolate to ovate in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is generally hairless or nearly so, giving it a smooth appearance, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
