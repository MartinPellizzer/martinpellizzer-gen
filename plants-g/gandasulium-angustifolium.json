    "intro": "Gandasulium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas."
