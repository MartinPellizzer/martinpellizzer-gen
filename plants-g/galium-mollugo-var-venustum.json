    "intro": "Galium mollugo var. venustum, commonly known as glossy wood-sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, erect stalks. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in cultivated areas."
