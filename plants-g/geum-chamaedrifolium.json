    "intro": "Geum chamaedrifolium, commonly known as creeping oxeye, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a dense mat of slender, upright stems covered with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with white centers, resembling daisies, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
