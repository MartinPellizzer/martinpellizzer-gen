    "intro": "Galatella acris, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss. Galatella acris is often found in mountainous areas of Argentina, Chile, and Peru, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
