    "intro": "Gnaphalium undulatifolium, commonly known as the undulate leaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, fluffy white flowers that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. Its leaves are undulate, meaning they have a wavy or rippled edge, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in grasslands and coastal areas."
