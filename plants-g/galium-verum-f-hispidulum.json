    "intro": "Galium verum f. hispidulum, commonly known as yellow bedstraw, is a flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. The inflorescence consists of clusters of tiny, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
