    "intro": "Gastrodia qingyunshanensis, commonly known as the Qingyunshan ginseng, is a rare orchid species native to China. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a fleshy, underground rhizome and a single, erect stem with lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, showy white or pale yellow flower, which is typical of the Gastrodia genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
