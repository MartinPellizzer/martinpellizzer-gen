    "intro": "Gynopogon brevipes, commonly known as the short-footed grass, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It has slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Gynopogon brevipes is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
