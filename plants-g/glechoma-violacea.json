    "intro": "Glechoma violacea, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant spreads via runners, forming dense mats that can cover large areas, making it both a decorative ground cover and a potential weed. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its genus, Glechoma, which is derived from the Greek word for \"to creep,\" referring to its spreading growth habit."
