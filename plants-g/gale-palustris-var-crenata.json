    "intro": "Gale palustris var. crenata, commonly known as the crested marsh hawthorn, is a variant of the marsh hawthorn native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-edged leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its fruit is a small, red berry that ripens in the fall and serves as a food source for various bird species. This plant plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
