    "intro": "Gagnepainia harmandii, commonly known as the Harmand's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, a trait typical of cycads, and is dioecious, meaning male and female reproductive structures are found on separate plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gagnepainia harmandii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activities."
