    "intro": "Garcinia rhizophoroides, commonly known as the mangrove Garcinia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, elliptical leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by orange or red berries containing a single seed. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important species for coastal vegetation and ecological studies."
