    "intro": "Gilia latiflora subsp. davyi, commonly known as the broadleaf gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its showy, typically pink or red flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. The leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
