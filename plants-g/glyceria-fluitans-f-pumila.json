    "intro": "Glyceria fluitans f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf floating grass, is a compact, herbaceous plant that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with slender, hairy stems and small, cylindrical leaves. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and along the edges of lakes. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or used in ecological restoration projects."
