    "intro": "Genista sessilifolia subsp. sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile leaf broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, woody stems and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are usually sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and rocky habitats. This subspecies is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
