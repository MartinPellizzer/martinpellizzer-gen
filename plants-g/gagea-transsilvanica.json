    "intro": "Gagea transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian spring beauty, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
