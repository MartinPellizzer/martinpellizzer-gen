    "intro": "Glossopappus macrotus subsp. macrotus, commonly known as the narrowleaf burrgrass, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its erect, sparsely hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, which are followed by distinctive pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops, often found in southern and western Australia. This species is adapted to arid conditions and is relatively drought-tolerant."
