    "intro": "Galenia glandulifera, commonly known as the stickyweed or glandular galenia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils, often along riverbanks and in grasslands. The plant is characterized by its erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain several seeds. Galenia glandulifera is known for its sticky secretions, which can adhere to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal."
