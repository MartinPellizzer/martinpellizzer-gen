    "intro": "Gymnocalycium ochoterenae var. altautinense, commonly known as the Altautinensis Cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the Andes Mountains of Peru. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
