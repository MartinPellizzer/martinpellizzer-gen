    "intro": "Guzmania cerifera, commonly known as the candle plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, candle-like inflorescence that can reach up to 2 meters in height, making it a dramatic centerpiece in gardens or indoor spaces. The plant features a rosette of waxy, strap-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red or purple. Its flowers, which appear at the tip of the inflorescence, are typically small and clustered in a spadix, adding a subtle touch of color. Guzmania cerifera thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
