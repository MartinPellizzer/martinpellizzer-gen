    "intro": "Gleichenia candida, commonly known as the white fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically covered in a fine, white powder, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant is native to various regions in the Southern Hemisphere, including parts of Australia, New Zealand, and South America. Gleichenia candida thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in the ecological diversity of its habitat."
