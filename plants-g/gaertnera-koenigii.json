    "intro": "Gaertnera koenigii, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stalks above the water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of the water, providing a striking visual contrast. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Gaertnera koenigii has cultural and religious significance in many Asian countries, particularly in Hinduism and Buddhism."
