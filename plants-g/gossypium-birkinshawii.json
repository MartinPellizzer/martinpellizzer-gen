    "intro": "Gossypium birkinshawii, commonly known as the Kew cotton, is a rare and endangered species of cotton native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and produces fluffy, white cotton-like fibers that are not typically used for commercial textile production. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Its botanical significance lies in its unique genetic makeup and its role in the study of cotton evolution. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
