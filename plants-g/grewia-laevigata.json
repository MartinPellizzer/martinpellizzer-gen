    "intro": "Grewia laevigata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or smoothleaf grewia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, round, red fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats. Grewia laevigata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
