    "intro": "Galium rupifragum, commonly known as rock bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender stems that often lie prostrate or ascending, covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a waxy coating. Galium rupifragum thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
