    "intro": "Gothofreda pachyglossa, commonly known as the broad-lipped ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its ethereal common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale or translucent, with a subtle, almost spectral appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists alike."
