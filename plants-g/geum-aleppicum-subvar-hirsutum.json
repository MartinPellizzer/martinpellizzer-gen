    "intro": "Geum aleppicum subvar. hirsutum, commonly known as the Hirsute Avens, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and prefers well-drained, rocky soils in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in alpine meadows and dry grasslands, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat. The hirsutum subspecies is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment."
