    "intro": "Graphephorum melicoides var. cooleyi, commonly known as the Cooley's ghost orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as pine flatwoods and scrub habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
