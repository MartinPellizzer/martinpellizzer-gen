    "intro": "Gagea pratensis f. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled spring beauty, is a rare and delicate perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a basal rosette of foliage. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
