    "intro": "Gleichenia subandina, commonly known as the Andean maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to South America. It belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and form dense mats, which help in soil stabilization. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
