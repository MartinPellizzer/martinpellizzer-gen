    "intro": "Guettarda xylosteoides, commonly known as the silverleaf guettarda, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its woody stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Guettarda xylosteoides thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites."
