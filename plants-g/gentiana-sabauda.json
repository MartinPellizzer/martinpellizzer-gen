    "intro": "Gentiana sabauda, commonly known as the royal gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stem is erect and bears the showy flowers. Gentiana sabauda is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
