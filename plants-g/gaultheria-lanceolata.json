    "intro": "Gaultheria lanceolata, commonly known as the evergreen trailing twinflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, hairy stems. Its berries, which are typically red or black, are edible and contain a single seed. Gaultheria lanceolata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes."
