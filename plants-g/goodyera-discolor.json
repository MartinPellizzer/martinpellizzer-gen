    "intro": "Goodyera discolor, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in forest understories. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is often protected and difficult to cultivate outside its natural range."
