    "intro": "Gerardia strictifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gerardia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom in the summer months. Gerardia strictifolia is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in coastal and arid environments. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
