    "intro": "Goodyera decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a rosette of lance-shaped leaves that form a dense, compact structure. The plant produces a tall, slender flowering stem bearing a dense spike of small, greenish-white flowers that are often mistaken for moss due to their appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and is often found growing on the forest floor. Goodyera decipiens is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptation to low-light conditions."
