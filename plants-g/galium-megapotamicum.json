    "intro": "Galium megapotamicum, commonly known as the Andean bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and streambanks. Galium megapotamicum is often found in the Andes and is adapted to the region's cool, humid climate."
