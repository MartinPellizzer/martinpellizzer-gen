    "intro": "Gastrodia callosa, commonly known as the Chinese club moss or thunder god's orchid, is a unique plant belonging to the orchid family. It is characterized by its lack of true roots and its ability to absorb nutrients through its stem and leaves. The plant is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, Korea, and Japan, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its underground tuberous structures are valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
