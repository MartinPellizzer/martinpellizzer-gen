    "intro": "Glomera merrillii, commonly known as the Merrill's glomera, is a rare flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, where it thrives in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, often with a slight pubescence, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Glomera merrillii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
