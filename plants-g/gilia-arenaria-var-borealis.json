    "intro": "Gilia arenaria var. borealis, commonly known as the northern sand gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, with five petals and a distinctive, narrow corolla. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and its ecological importance to pollinators."
