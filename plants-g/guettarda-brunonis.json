    "intro": "Guettarda brunonis, commonly known as the coastal guettarda, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows near coastal areas, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Guettarda brunonis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
