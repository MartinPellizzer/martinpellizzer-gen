    "intro": "Goodyera schlechtendaliana var. ogatae, commonly known as the Japanese lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its striking, fragrant, lavender-colored flowers that bloom in a loose raceme. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, tuberous roots that help it survive in its specialized habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
