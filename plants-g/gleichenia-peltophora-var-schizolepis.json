    "intro": "Gleichenia peltophora var. schizolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Gleichenia, is a fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, overlapping pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually dimorphic, with fertile and sterile leaves differing in structure. The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
