    "intro": "Gagea bonnassieui, commonly known as the Bonnassieu's gagea, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing white or pale pink petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
