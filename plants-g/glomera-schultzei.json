    "intro": "Glomera schultzei, commonly known as the Schultze's glomera, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous or forested areas. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Glomera schultzei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
