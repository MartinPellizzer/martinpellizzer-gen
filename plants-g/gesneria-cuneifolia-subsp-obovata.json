It is characterized by its broad, obovate-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom during the wet season. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
