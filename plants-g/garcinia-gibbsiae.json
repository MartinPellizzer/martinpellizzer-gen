    "intro": "Garcinia gibbsiae, commonly known as the African mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces bright red, fleshy fruits that are similar in appearance to the mangosteen but are typically smaller and less commonly consumed. Its botanical significance lies in its potential medicinal properties and use in traditional medicine. Garcinia gibbsiae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
