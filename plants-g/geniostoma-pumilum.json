It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often clustered at the base, giving it a rosette appearance. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish or brownish in color, and are clustered in dense inflorescences. Geniostoma pumilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
