    "intro": "Galium mucronatum, commonly known as the sharp-tipped bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features slender, branched stems covered in fine, stiff hairs. Its small, white or pale blue flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, three-lobed berries that are dispersed by birds. Galium mucronatum is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
