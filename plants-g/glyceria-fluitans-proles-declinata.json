    "intro": "Glyceria fluitans proles declinata, commonly known as the declining floating glyceria, is a rare aquatic plant characterized by its slender, grass-like stems that float on the water's surface. It typically grows in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, contributing to its limited visibility. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, adapted for buoyancy and photosynthesis in aquatic conditions. Due to habitat loss and water pollution, this species is considered endangered in many regions."
