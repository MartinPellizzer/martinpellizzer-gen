    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza inermis, commonly known as the sweet root or licorice plant, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by legume-like pods containing small, brown seeds. Glycyrrhiza inermis is valued for its roots, which are rich in glycyrrhizin and have been used traditionally in herbal medicine. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
