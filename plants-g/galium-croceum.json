It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite and have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are clustered in whorls along the stems. Galium croceum is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
