The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, branching clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important species for pollinators and a subject of ecological study."
