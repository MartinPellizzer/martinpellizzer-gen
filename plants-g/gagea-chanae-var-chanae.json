    "intro": "Gagea chanae var. chanae, commonly known as the Chanae's gagea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers. The plant is characterized by its small, ovoid bulbs that are often covered in a fibrous sheath. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
