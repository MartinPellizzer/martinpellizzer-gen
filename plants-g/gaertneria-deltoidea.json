    "intro": "Gaertneria deltoidea, commonly known as the delta fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of a fern, though it is not a true fern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories in tropical regions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it has a relatively compact growth habit. Gaertneria deltoidea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
