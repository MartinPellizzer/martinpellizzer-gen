    "intro": "Grammitis callichore, commonly known as the golden grammitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and intricate fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden-colored bloom. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's rhizomes form dense mats, contributing to its ability to colonize rocky or soil-rich substrates. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
