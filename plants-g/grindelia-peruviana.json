    "intro": "Grindelia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian gumweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Grindelia peruviana is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in coastal and inland regions."
