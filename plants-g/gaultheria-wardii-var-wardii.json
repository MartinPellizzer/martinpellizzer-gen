    "intro": "Gaultheria wardii var. wardii, commonly known as the Andean wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Andes mountains. It produces small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in late summer. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are aromatic when crushed, containing compounds similar to those found in wintergreen oil. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories at high elevations. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
