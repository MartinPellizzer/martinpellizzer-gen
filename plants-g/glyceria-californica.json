    "intro": "Glyceria californica, commonly known as California glyceria, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in wetland and riparian habitats, thriving in moist to moderately wet soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. Glyceria californica is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of lakes and rivers."
