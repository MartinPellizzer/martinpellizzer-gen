    "intro": "Gnaphalium lanuginosum, commonly known as the downy everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with dense, woolly gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its scientific name reflects its hairy appearance, with \"lanuginosum\" referring to the lanugo-like downy coating on its stems and leaves."
