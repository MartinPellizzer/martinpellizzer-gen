    "intro": "Grevillea goodii subsp. pluricaulis, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. This subspecies thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. It is an important plant in native gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
