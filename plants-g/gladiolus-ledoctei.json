    "intro": "Gladiolus ledoctei, commonly known as the Ledi's gladiolus, is a rare and striking member of the Iridaceae family. Native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, this plant is adapted to cool, moist environments. It produces tall, slender stems that bear showy, brightly colored flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The flowers are typically arranged in dense spikes and are surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gladiolus ledoctei is considered a species of conservation concern."
