These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. They are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, often yellow or orange flowers. Gynandropsis species typically have milky sap, which is a distinguishing botanical feature. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine and for their ornamental value."
