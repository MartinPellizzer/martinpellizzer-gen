    "intro": "Gentiana chirayita, commonly known as the Bhutan skyflower, is a striking alpine plant native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its deep blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or mountainous regions, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are erect and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
