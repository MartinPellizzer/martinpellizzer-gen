    "intro": "Genista hispanica subsp. hispanica, commonly known as Spanish broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its slender, spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, leathery pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
