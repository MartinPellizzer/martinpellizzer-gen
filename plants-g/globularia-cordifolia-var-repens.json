It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a slightly fuzzy texture. The flowers are usually pale blue or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and ability to spread slowly, forming dense mats."
