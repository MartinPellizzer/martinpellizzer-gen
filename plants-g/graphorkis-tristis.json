    "intro": "Graphorkis tristis, commonly known as the weeping brodiaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces a bulbous underground stem, which serves as its storage organ and aids in its survival during dry periods. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Graphorkis tristis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
