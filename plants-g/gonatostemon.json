    "intro": "Gonatostemon, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. The plants are characterized by their compact, succulent growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring. They typically have small, narrow leaves and produce seeds in elongated, cylindrical capsules. Gonatostemon species are often used in rock gardens due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
