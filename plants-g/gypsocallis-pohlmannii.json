    "intro": "Gypsocallis pohlmannii, commonly known as the Pohlmann's gypso, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Peru, it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its foliage consists of long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
