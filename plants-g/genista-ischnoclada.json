    "intro": "Genista ischnoclada, commonly known as the narrowleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, elongated fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
