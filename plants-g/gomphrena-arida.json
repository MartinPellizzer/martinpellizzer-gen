    "intro": "Gomphrena arida, commonly known as the desert gomphrena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor, sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss. Gomphrena arida is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
