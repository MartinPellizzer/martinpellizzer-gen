It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in sparse, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
