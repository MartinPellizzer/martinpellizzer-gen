It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, fluffy capitula that are often mistaken for dandelion flowers, though they are structurally different. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
