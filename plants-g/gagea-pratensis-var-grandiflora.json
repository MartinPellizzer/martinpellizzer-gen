    "intro": "Gagea pratensis var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered spring beauty, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats, preferring partial shade and well-drained soil. Its flowers are borne on short pedicels, and the plant is noted for its early blooming habit. It plays a role in supporting early-season pollinators and is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks."
