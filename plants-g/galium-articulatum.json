    "intro": "Galium articulatum, commonly known as interrupted woodcrusher, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often break easily, giving it its scientific name. The plant has opposite, simple, and usually hairy leaves, and small white or pale pink flowers that appear in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium articulatum is often found in disturbed soils and can spread vegetatively through its stolons."
