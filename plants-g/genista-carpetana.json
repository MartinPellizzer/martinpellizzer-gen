    "intro": "Genista carpetana, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to Mediterranean climates. It produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
