    "intro": "Gentianella obtusifolia subsp. norica, commonly known as the Alpine gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils at high altitudes, often in mountain meadows and grasslands. The plant features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. The subspecies norica is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly larger flowers compared to other subspecies of Gentianella obtusifolia."
