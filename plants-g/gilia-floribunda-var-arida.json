    "intro": "Gilia floribunda var. arida, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
