    "intro": "Galium cenisium, commonly known as common bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Galium cenisium is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
