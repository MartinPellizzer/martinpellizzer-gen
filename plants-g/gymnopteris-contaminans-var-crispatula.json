It is a perennial fern characterized by its distinctive fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and moist soil, thriving in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered along the underside of the fronds. The varietal name *crispatula* refers to the serrated or toothed margins of its leaves."
