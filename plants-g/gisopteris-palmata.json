    "intro": "Gisopteris palmata, commonly known as the palmate fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with fronds that are palmately divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows from a short rhizome and produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds. Its leaves are usually dark green and leathery, providing a dense, ornamental appearance. Gisopteris palmata is often cultivated as a decorative plant in shaded gardens or as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
