    "intro": "Grammitis urania, commonly known as the silver fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and the fronds are often curled when young. Grammitis urania is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
