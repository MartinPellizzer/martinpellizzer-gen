It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along roadsides and in desert scrub habitats. Grindelia patens is also noted for its ability to produce a sticky, resinous substance from its leaves."
