    "intro": "Gladiolus imbricatus var. galiciensis, commonly known as the Galician gladiolus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of Galicia in northwestern Spain. It features striking, sword-shaped leaves and tall, upright stems that bear clusters of vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The flowers are typically arranged in dense spikes, with each bloom having three prominent sepals that resemble a sword, giving the plant its genus name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty and resilience."
