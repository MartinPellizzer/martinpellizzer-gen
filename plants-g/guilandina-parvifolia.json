    "intro": "Guilandina parvifolia, commonly known as the slender legume or small-flowered guilandina, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Its roots are known to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility, while its vines can reach lengths of several meters. Guilandina parvifolia is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories."
