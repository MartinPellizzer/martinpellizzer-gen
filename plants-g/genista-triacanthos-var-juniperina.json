    "intro": "Genista triacanthos var. juniperina, commonly known as the Juniper-like Broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are narrow and leathery, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. This variety is closely related to other members of the Genista genus, which are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. Its evergreen foliage and adaptability make it a popular choice for coastal and dry garden environments."
