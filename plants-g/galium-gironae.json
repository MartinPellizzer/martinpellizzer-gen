    "intro": "Galium gironae, commonly known as the Girona bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Galium gironae is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and limited distribution make it a notable yet rare species in Mediterranean flora."
