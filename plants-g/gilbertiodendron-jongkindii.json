    "intro": "Gilbertiodendron jongkindii, commonly known as the Congo mahogany, is a medium-sized evergreen tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dark, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with an odd number of leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its fruit is a legume pod containing flat, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
