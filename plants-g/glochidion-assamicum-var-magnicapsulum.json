    "intro": "Glochidion assamicum var. magnicapsulum, commonly known as the large-capsule glochidion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the northeastern regions of India, particularly Assam, and thrives in moist, tropical forest environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that is notably larger than in other varieties of the species, giving it its common name. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations."
