It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, spiral-shaped inflorescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss, Gynandriris spiralis is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation efforts."
