    "intro": "Grammitis duplopilosa, commonly known as the double-pinion fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis duplopilosa is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
