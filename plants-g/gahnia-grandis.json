    "intro": "Gahnia grandis, commonly known as the tall tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, dense clumps of leafy foliage that form a tussock-like structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Gahnia grandis is often found in wetlands, swamps, and other moist habitats, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife."
