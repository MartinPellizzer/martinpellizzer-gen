    "intro": "Galarhoeus esula f. humilior, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate white flowers. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant typically grows in high-altitude alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a subtle, spicy scent, while its flowers bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
