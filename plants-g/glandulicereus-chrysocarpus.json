    "intro": "Glandulicereus chrysocarpus, commonly known as the golden fruit cactus, is a species native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp spines and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, orange-colored fruits that are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick stems, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique fruit."
