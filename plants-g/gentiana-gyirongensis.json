It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, known for its vibrant blue and violet flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
