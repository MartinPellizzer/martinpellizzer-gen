    "intro": "Gastrodia exilis, commonly known as the slender thunder god, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China, particularly in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, yellowish-brown rhizome, which is highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing on the roots of other trees in forested areas. Due to its rarity and medicinal value, Gastrodia exilis is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
