    "intro": "Galium saxatile var. hercynicum, commonly known as the Hercynian bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to rocky and mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, while its fruits are small, dry berries. This variant is distinguished by its slightly larger size and more robust growth compared to other Galium species."
