    "intro": "Gazania pottsii, commonly known as the Potts' gazania, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright, daisy-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces showy, ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets, which are typical of the sunflower family. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Gazania pottsii is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and salt spray, which contributes to its hardiness in coastal environments."
