    "intro": "Glomera manicata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its roots are known to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, enhancing nutrient uptake. The plant is often found in wetlands and along the edges of freshwater bodies."
