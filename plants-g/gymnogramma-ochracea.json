    "intro": "Gymnogramma ochracea, commonly known as the yellow-backed staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that often form dense, bushy clusters. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its leaves are usually dark green with a distinctive yellow or ochre-colored underside, giving it its common name. Gymnogramma ochracea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
