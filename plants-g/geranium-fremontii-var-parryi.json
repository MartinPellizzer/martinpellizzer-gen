    "intro": "Geranium fremontii var. parryi, commonly known as Parry's geranium, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native pollinators."
