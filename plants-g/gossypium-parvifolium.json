    "intro": "Gossypium parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaf cotton or parvifolium cotton, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and produces fluffy, white cotton-like fibers that are harvested for textile use. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal growth. Due to its adaptability to harsh environments, it is often used in restoration projects in dryland ecosystems."
