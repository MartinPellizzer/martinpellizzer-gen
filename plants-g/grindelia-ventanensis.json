    "intro": "Grindelia ventanensis, commonly known as the desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes, where it has adapted to survive with minimal water. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow and appear in clusters, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
