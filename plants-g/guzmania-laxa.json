    "intro": "Guzmania laxa, commonly known as the pink flamingo plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting bracts that often display shades of pink, red, and orange, resembling the plumage of a flamingo. The plant features a rosette of grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and insects. Its flowering stem produces multiple small, white, tubular flowers that bloom sequentially over time. Guzmania laxa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
