    "intro": "Gnaphalium connatum, commonly known as the slender everlasting or common everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern and eastern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called capitula. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting, aromatic blooms."
