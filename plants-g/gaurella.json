    "intro": "Gaurella, commonly known as false heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plants are characterized by their dense, mat-forming growth habit and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Gaurella species typically thrive in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making them popular in ornamental gardening. Their foliage is often ornamental, with leaves that are glossy and sometimes variegated, adding visual interest to gardens."
