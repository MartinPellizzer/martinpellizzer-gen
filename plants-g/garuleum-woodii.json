    "intro": "Garuleum woodii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying entirely on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces showy, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in wet, swampy habitats and is often found growing on the trunks of trees. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is listed as an endangered species."
