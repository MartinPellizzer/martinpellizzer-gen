    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea var. comigera, commonly known as the Comigo's grass pink, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear showy, pinkish-white flowers arranged in a loose raceme. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in temperate regions of Europe and North America. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers have three sepals and three petals, with the latter being prominently spurred. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
