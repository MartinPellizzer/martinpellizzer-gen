    "intro": "Gomphocarpus sphacelatus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant produces a distinctive, spiny fruit called a follicle, which contains the seeds. Its milky sap, which is toxic, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Gomphocarpus sphacelatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in gardens and natural habitats."
