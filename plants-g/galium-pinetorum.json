    "intro": "Galium pinetorum, commonly known as pine woods star, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as pine and hardwood forests, often forming dense mats on the forest floor. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture. Galium pinetorum plays a role in providing nectar for pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
