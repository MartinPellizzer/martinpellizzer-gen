    "intro": "Geissaspis princei, commonly known as the Prince's geissaspis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, bloom in spring and are short-lived, contributing to its elusive nature. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
