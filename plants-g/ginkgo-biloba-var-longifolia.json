    "intro": "Ginkgo biloba var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf ginkgo, is a variant of the ginkgo tree characterized by its elongated, fan-shaped leaves. This variety is native to China and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage. The leaves are typically longer and narrower than those of the standard ginkgo, giving it a unique appearance. It is a deciduous tree that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for urban landscaping. The plant is also valued for its air-purifying properties and historical significance in traditional medicine."
