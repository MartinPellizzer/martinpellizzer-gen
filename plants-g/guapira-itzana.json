    "intro": "Guapira itzana, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by bright purple or red berries. These berries are edible for some animals but are generally not consumed by humans due to their bitter taste and potential toxicity. Guapira itzana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
