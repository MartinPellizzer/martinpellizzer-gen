    "intro": "Goniophlebium invertens, commonly known as the inverted leaf fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. Its fronds are typically bi-pinnate, with a peculiar inversion of the pinnae, giving it a visually striking appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and colonize areas effectively. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the leaves, a common feature among ferns."
