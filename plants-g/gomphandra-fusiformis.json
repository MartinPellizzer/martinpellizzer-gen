    "intro": "Gomphandra fusiformis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed gomphandra, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with four petals, typically in shades of white or pale pink. It is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
