    "intro": "Gomphocarpus navicularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are often surrounded by a hood-like structure. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Gomphocarpus navicularis is also a host plant for certain butterfly species, contributing to local biodiversity."
