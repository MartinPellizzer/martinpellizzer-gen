    "intro": "Gnetum neglectum var. procerum, commonly known as the slender gnetum, is a member of the Gnetophyta division, characterized by its unique combination of gymnosperm and angiosperm traits. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female individuals, and typically grows as a shrub or small tree in tropical and subtropical regions. The leaves are usually simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, while the stems are often covered in a distinctive, waxy cuticle. This variant is notable for its elongated, slender growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on evolutionary adaptations in gymnosperms."
