    "intro": "Gossypium hirsutum var. mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican cotton, is a variant of upland cotton native to Mexico. It is characterized by its fibrous boll structure and hairy leaves, typical of the Gossypium genus. The plant thrives in warm, arid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its fibers are used in textile production, similar to other cotton varieties. However, it is less commonly cultivated today due to its lower yield compared to modern commercial cotton strains."
