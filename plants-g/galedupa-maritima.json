    "intro": "Galedupa maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it withstand salty air and strong winds. The plant has a compact growth habit, making it well-suited for maritime environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs that reduce water loss and protect against UV radiation. Galedupa maritima is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
