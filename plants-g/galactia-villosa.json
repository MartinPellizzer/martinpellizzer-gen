    "intro": "Galactia villosa, commonly known as the hairy galactia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several small, round seeds. Galactia villosa is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
