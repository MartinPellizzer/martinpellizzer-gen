    "intro": "Gouldia terminalis var. myrsinoidea, commonly known as the red-flowered gouldia, is a striking ornamental plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, tubular red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its vibrant color and is often used in rock gardens or as a container plant."
