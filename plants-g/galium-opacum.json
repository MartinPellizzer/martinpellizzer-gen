    "intro": "Galium opacum, commonly known as shining bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs that give the plant a distinctive, almost silvery appearance. Galium opacum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
