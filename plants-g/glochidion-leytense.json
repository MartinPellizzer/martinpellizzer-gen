    "intro": "Glochidion leytense, commonly known as the Leyte glabrous leaf vine, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually glabrous or nearly hairless. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
