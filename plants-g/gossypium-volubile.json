    "intro": "Gossypium volubile, commonly known as the wild cotton plant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces fluffy, white fibers that are similar to those of cultivated cotton, though it is not typically harvested for commercial use. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing along rocky slopes and in dry, well-drained soils. Gossypium volubile is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
