It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The genus includes several species, many of which are valued for their hard, durable wood. Guarea trees typically have smooth, gray bark and simple, opposite leaves. They produce small, yellowish flowers followed by woody fruits that contain one or two seeds."
