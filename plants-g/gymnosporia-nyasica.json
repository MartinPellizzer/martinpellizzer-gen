    "intro": "Gymnosporia nyasica, commonly known as the Natal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, which attract nectar-feeding insects. Gymnosporia nyasica is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
