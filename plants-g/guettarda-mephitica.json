    "intro": "Guettarda mephitica, commonly known as the swamp guettarda, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and coastal areas of the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in swamps and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Guettarda mephitica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging wetland environments."
