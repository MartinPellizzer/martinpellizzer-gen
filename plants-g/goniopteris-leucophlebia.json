    "intro": "Goniopteris leucophlebia, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a prehistoric plant that thrived during the Carboniferous period. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds with distinct, whitish veins that contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant's structure suggests it was a tree-like fern, with a robust stem and broad, fan-shaped leaves. Its fossils are often found in coal deposits, indicating its role in ancient swamp ecosystems. The botanical features of Goniopteris leucophlebia provide important insights into the evolution of early vascular plants."
