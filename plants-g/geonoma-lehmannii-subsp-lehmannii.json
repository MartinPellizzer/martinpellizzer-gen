    "intro": "Geonoma lehmannii subsp. lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that create a water-holding cavity. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps in retaining moisture. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
