    "intro": "Gynura aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that can grow up to 2 meters in height, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
