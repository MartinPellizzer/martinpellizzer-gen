    "intro": "Galarhoeus lasiocaulus, commonly known as the rough-hair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are often dark green with a rough, textured surface due to the presence of fine, hairy scales. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and play a key role in its life cycle."
