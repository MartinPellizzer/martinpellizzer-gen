It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and the leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Gnaphalium subsericeum is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes and inland sandplains."
