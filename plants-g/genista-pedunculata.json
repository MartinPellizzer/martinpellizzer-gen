    "intro": "Genista pedunculata, commonly known as sweet honeycomb bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, branched stems covered in small, spiny leaves that are alternate and pinnately divided. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, pea-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by long, narrow pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its fragrant blooms and unique, honeycomb-like appearance."
