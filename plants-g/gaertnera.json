It consists of several species native to the Americas, particularly South America. The plants are typically shrubs with small, often clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. They have opposite or whorled leaf arrangements and produce capsules as their fruit type. Gaertnera species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
