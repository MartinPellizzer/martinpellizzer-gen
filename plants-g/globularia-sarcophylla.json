    "intro": "Globularia sarcophylla, commonly known as the rock globularia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense, rounded clusters of foliage. The plant produces small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fleshy, succulent leaves are adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments. Globularia sarcophylla is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
