It is characterized by its large, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a single, sturdy stem that can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its bulbs are fleshy and store nutrients, allowing the plant to survive in dry conditions. It prefers well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and woodland settings."
