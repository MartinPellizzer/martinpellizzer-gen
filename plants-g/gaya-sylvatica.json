    "intro": "Gaya sylvatica, commonly known as the European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal. Gaya sylvatica is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
