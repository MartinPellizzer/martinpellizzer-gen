    "intro": "Goodyera brachiorhynchos, commonly known as the small-leaf potterscale, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that are clustered in a spike, with petals that are typically shorter than the sepals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and is often found in association with mosses and ferns. Goodyera brachiorhynchos is a low-growing plant with a rhizomatous root system, making it well adapted to its woodland habitat."
