    "intro": "Grammangis, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its thick, board-like leaves and extensive root system, which help stabilize shorelines. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, making it an essential component of mangrove ecosystems. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in the axils of the leaves. Grammangis plays a vital role in coastal protection and provides habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
