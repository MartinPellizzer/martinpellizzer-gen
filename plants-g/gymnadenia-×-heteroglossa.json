    "intro": "Gymnadenia \u00d7 heteroglossa, commonly known as the hybrid grass of heaven, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Gymnadenia clypeata and Gymnadenia conopsea, characterized by its tall, grass-like appearance and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of pale yellow to cream-colored flowers, which bloom in late summer. Gymnadenia \u00d7 heteroglossa is often found in temperate regions of Europe and is of interest to botanists due to its hybrid origin and ecological significance."
