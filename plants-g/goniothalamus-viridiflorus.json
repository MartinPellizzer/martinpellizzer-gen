    "intro": "Goniothalamus viridiflorus, commonly known as the green-flowered goniothalamus, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its fruits are fleshy berries that mature to a yellow or orange color, containing several seeds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral morphology and potential medicinal properties."
