    "intro": "Gleditsia monosperma, commonly known as the honey locust, is a deciduous legume native to the United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately divided into 15\u201330 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes, followed by long, bean-like pods containing a single, edible seed. It is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. The honey locust is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules."
