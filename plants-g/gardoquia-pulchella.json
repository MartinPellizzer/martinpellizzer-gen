    "intro": "Gardoquia pulchella, commonly known as the beautiful gardoquia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Gardoquia pulchella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapic gardens due to its drought tolerance."
