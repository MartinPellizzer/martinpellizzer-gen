    "intro": "Galium umbrosum var. gaudichaudii-glabrescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate or ascend, forming dense mats. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a velvety texture. Small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters at the leaf axils, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
