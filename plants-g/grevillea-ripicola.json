    "intro": "Grevillea ripicola, commonly known as the rock wallaby bush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern and western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Grevillea ripicola is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that thrives in full sun."
