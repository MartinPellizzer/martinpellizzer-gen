    "intro": "Gymnogramma goudotii, commonly known as the Goudot's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, lanceolate segments. The plant is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. Gymnogramma goudotii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rock surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
