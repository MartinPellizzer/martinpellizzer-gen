    "intro": "Guzmania lingulata var. minor, commonly known as the miniature guzmania, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange, often resembling a torch. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small aquatic environment for microorganisms and small invertebrates. Its compact size makes it ideal for indoor cultivation, thriving in bright, indirect light and high humidity. The plant is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity within its natural habitat."
