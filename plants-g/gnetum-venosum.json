    "intro": "Gnetum venosum, commonly known as the vein gnetum, is a unique member of the Gnetophyta division, characterized by its gymnosperm-like features. It is a tropical plant that typically grows as an epiphyte or a climbing vine, often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant has scale-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers, which are pollinated by insects. Its reproductive structures include separate male and female cones, a trait shared with other gymnosperms. The species is notable for its vascular system, which exhibits a complex network of veins, contributing to its name."
