    "intro": "Geum reptans subsp. eureptans, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with three oval, serrated leaflets and produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
