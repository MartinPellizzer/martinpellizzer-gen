    "intro": "Gonystylus affinis, commonly known as the yellow ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, durable wood that is highly valued in traditional construction. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody fruits containing several seeds. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, Gonystylus affinis is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
