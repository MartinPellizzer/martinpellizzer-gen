    "intro": "Guajava amplexicaulis, commonly known as the climbing guajava, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vigorous climbing habit and large, heart-shaped leaves that often encircle the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by edible, red fruits similar to those of the common guava. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a distinct floral structure. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories."
