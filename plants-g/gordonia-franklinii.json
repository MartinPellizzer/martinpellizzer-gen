    "intro": "Gordonia franklinii, commonly known as Franklin's beech, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elongated, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, which are typically white or pale pink, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Gordonia franklinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
