    "intro": "Guatteria maypurensis var. attenuata, commonly known as the slender guatteria, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, while its fruit is a fleshy, yellowish berry. This variant is distinguished by its attenuated (tapered) leaves, which set it apart from other members of the species."
