    "intro": "Gyrostachys eugenii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Gyrostachys eugenii is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
