    "intro": "Graphistylis cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf grass or the slender spike grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in native plant landscaping."
