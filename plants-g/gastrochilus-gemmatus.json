    "intro": "Gastrochilus gemmatus, commonly known as the gemmated stomach lip, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant prefers cool, shaded environments and thrives in high humidity, often growing on rock surfaces or in dense forest undergrowth. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
