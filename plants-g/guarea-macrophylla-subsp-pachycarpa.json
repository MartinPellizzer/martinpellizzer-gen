It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. Its bark is thick and often has a rough, fissured texture, providing structural support and protection. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland tropical rainforests."
