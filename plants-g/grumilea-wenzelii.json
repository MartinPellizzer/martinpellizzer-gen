    "intro": "Grumilea wenzelii, commonly known as the Wenzel's grumirea, is a unique species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually broad and oval, with a smooth surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Grumilea wenzelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
