It is characterized by its vivid blue to violet flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns of darker coloration. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, helping to retain moisture in harsh environments. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its beauty."
