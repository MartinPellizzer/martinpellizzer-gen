    "intro": "Galium tinctorium var. labradoricum, commonly known as Labrador bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy, while its fruit is a small, dry capsule containing several seeds. Labrador bedstraw has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a dye plant due to its chemical properties."
