    "intro": "Galactia cruelsiana, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought conditions. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces slender, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The plant's hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, making it well-suited for its harsh habitat."
