    "intro": "Gaultheria nummulariae, commonly known as the silverleaf trailing evergreen, is a low-growing shrub native to South America. It features small, round, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Gaultheria nummulariae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground covers in shaded environments."
