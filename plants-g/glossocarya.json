    "intro": "Glossocarya, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Glossocarya is often found in wetland areas and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
