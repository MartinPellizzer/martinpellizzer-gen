    "intro": "Grossularia alpestris var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant mountain currant, is a deciduous shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range from white to pink and are borne in clusters. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or orange, similar to those of other currant species. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
