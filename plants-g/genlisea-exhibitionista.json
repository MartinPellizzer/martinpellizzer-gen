    "intro": "Genlisea exhibitionista, commonly known as the \"showy buttercup,\" is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and specialized bladder-like traps used to capture prey. The plant's leaves are modified into intricate, bladder-shaped structures that can rapidly snap shut to trap tiny insects. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, relying on captured prey for essential nutrients. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
