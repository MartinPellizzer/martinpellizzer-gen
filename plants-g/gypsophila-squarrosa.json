    "intro": "Gypsophila squarrosa, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its stems are often covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gypsophila squarrosa is a member of the Pink Family (Caryophyllaceae) and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
