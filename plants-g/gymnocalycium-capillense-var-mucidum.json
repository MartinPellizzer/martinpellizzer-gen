    "intro": "Gymnocalycium capillense var. mucidum, commonly known as the sticky hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, soft spines and a dense coating of fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to dry environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
