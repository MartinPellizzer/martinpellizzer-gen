    "intro": "Gentiana vagneriana, commonly known as the Vagner's gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are erect and branched. The flowers are tubular with two lips, a feature common in many gentian species, and are pollinated primarily by insects."
