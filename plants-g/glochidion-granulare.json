    "intro": "Glochidion granulare, commonly known as the rough glochidion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries like India, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps or granules, giving it a rough texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, and it is often found in lowland rainforests or secondary growth areas. Glochidion granulare is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical uses are not as well-documented as those of other species in the genus."
