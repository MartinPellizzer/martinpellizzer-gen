    "intro": "Gossia grayi, commonly known as the gray gossia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the rainforests of eastern Australia, where it typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds. Gossia grayi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it prefers cool, humid conditions."
