    "intro": "Genista prostrata, commonly known as creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are narrow and trifoliate, with three small leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
