    "intro": "Galipea ossana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood and is often found in dry, lowland forests. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a sweet, fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Due to its valuable timber, Galipea ossana is threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
