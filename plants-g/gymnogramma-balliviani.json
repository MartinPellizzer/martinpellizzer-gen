    "intro": "Gymnogramma balliviani, commonly known as the balliviani spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a distinctive frond structure that features a short, thick stalk. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Gymnogramma balliviani is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air."
