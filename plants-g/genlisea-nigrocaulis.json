    "intro": "Genlisea nigrocaulis, commonly known as the black-stem bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshy or aquatic environments. Its stems are usually dark green to black, which helps in absorbing sunlight for photosynthesis. The small, inconspicuous flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant relies on capturing tiny aquatic animals to supplement its nutrient intake."
