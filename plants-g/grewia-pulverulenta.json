    "intro": "Grewia pulverulenta, commonly known as the dusty miller, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-white, velvety foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary ornamental value lies in its unique foliage."
