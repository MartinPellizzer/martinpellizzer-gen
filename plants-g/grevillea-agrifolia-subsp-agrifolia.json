It is characterized by its bright red flowers that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces distinctive, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract nectar-feeding birds and insects."
