    "intro": "Grevillea sarmentosa, commonly known as the weeping grevillea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its cascading clusters of bright red flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting birds and insects. The plant has slender, wiry stems that trail from the base, giving it a unique, weeping appearance. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive look. Grevillea sarmentosa is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt and sandy soils."
