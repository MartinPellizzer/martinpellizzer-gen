It is characterized by its bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces pods that contain seeds with a feathery appendage. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast. Gompholobium fimbriatum is a hardy plant that is well adapted to coastal conditions and is often used in coastal restoration projects."
