    "intro": "Genista tinctoria var. donetzica, commonly known as the Donetz broom, is a shrub native to the steppes of southern Russia and Ukraine. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in dye production, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
