    "intro": "Galeopsis canescens, commonly known as hairy skullcap, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and reaches heights of up to 60 centimeters. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its small, blue to purple flowers are clustered in whorls along the stem, and it produces small, dry fruits called capsules. Galeopsis canescens is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
