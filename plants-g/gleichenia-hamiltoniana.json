    "intro": "Gleichenia hamiltoniana, commonly known as the Hamilton's fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a thallus with a distinct leafy structure, consisting of a central stem and alternate, lanceolate leaves. Gleichenia hamiltoniana is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its morphology and ecological preferences make it an important component of humid forest ecosystems."
