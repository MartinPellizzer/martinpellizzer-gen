    "intro": "Galium aciphyllum var. longicaule, commonly known as the long-stemmed wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching near the base. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veinal pattern, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The species is characterized by its lack of true leaves, with the stems bearing the photosynthetic function."
