    "intro": "Gentiana frigida var. algida, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine meadows and subarctic environments where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The species is adapted to harsh climates and plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its mountainous habitat."
