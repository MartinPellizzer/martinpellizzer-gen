    "intro": "Gilliesia dimera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance, with long, narrow leaves and a single, slender flower that typically blooms in late summer. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
