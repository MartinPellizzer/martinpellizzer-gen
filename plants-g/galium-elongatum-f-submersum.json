    "intro": "Galium elongatum f. submersum, commonly known as the submerged bedstraw, is a rare aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often submerged stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically oval or elliptical in shape. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
