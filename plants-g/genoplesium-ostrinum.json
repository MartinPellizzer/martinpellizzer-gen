    "intro": "Genoplesium ostrinum, commonly known as the yellow spider-orchid, is an orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its striking, spider-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands or open forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
