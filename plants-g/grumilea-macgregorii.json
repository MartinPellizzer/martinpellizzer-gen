    "intro": "Grumilea macgregorii, commonly known as the MacGregor's grumihua, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers are often pink or purple, with a striking, lantern-like appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Grumilea macgregorii is considered a species of conservation concern."
