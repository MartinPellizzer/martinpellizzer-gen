    "intro": "Gerardia droseroides, commonly known as the sticky plant, is a unique carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant's leaves are often covered in tiny, hair-like structures that enhance its ability to capture prey. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients. Its striking appearance and specialized adaptations make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
