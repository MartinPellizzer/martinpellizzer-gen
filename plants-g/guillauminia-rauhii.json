Native to South Africa, this plant is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun conditions. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
