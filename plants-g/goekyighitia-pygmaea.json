    "intro": "Goekyighitia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its small, compact size, with a short trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves. Native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in warm, moist environments with partial shade. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, and its reproductive process is slow and requires specific environmental conditions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Goekyighitia pygmaea is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
