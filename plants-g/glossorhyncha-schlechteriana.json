    "intro": "Glossorhyncha schlechteriana, commonly known as the Schlechter's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated flower spikes that bear small, pale green or white flowers with a distinctive, ghost-like appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its limited habitat and threatened status, it is of great interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
