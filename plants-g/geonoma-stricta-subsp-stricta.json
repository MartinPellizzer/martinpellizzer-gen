    "intro": "Geonoma stricta subsp. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are usually elongated and have a distinct, serrated margin. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
