It is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, flexible stems that can ascend trees or other structures. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a glossy surface. Gravesia scandens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
