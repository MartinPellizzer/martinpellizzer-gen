    "intro": "Grewia tannifera, commonly known as the sour fig or red gum, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval or lance-shaped. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The fruit contains high levels of tannins, which contribute to its astringent taste and medicinal properties."
