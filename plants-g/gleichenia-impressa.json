    "intro": "Gleichenia impressa, commonly known as the common huperzia, is a fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that are typically dark green and somewhat leathery. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. Gleichenia impressa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. It is a relatively small fern, with fronds that can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters."
