It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its stiff, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Gahnia aspera produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
