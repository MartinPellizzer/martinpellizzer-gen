    "intro": "Galium palustre var. balticum, commonly known as marsh bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in northern regions. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, slender leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along stream banks. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
