It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its botanical features include hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves with a velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
