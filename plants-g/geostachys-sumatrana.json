    "intro": "Geostachys sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran geostachys, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Sumatra and Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and its leaves are usually opposite and elliptical in shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary rainforest undergrowth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
