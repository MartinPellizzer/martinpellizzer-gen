    "intro": "Gazania rigida, commonly known as the rigid gazania, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Gazania rigida is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
