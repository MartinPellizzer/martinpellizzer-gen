    "intro": "Gentiana eurycolpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream sides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are tubular with five petals, and they attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
