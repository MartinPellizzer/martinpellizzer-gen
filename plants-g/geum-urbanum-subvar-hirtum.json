It features basal leaves that are hairy and heart-shaped, with a reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its hairy stems and leaves help it retain moisture and resist herbivory."
