    "intro": "Gyrocarpus asiaticus var. zeylanicus, commonly known as the Ceylon ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen leaves that are alternate and elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, woody fruits that resemble a spiral. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
