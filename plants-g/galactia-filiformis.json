    "intro": "Galactia filiformis, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, vine-like stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Galactia filiformis thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
