    "intro": "Grevillea disjuncta subsp. dolichopoda, commonly known as the slender grevillea, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and its distinctive, long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, which are particularly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climate conditions with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
