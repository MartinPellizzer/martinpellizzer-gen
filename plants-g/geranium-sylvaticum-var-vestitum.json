It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland areas and is often found in acidic soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of forest ecosystems and a popular choice for native plant gardens."
