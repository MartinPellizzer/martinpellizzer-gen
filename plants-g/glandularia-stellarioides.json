    "intro": "Glandularia stellarioides, commonly known as starry glandularia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often resembling stars, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces numerous tiny, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which may serve to deter herbivores. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as deserts and grasslands. Glandularia stellarioides is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton."
