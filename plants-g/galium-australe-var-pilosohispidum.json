    "intro": "Galium australe var. pilosohispidum, commonly known as the silky wood-sorrel, is a variant of the wood-sorrel species native to Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. This variant is adapted to a range of soil types but thrives in moist, well-drained environments."
