It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
