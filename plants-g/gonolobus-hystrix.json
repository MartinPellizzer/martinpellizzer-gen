    "intro": "Gonolobus hystrix, commonly known as the spiked gorse, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Gonolobus hystrix is adapted to poor soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry forests."
