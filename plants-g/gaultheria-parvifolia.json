    "intro": "Gaultheria parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf strawberry bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, edible berries in late summer. These berries are rich in antioxidants and have a tart, slightly sweet flavor. Gaultheria parvifolia is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
