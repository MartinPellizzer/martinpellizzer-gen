    "intro": "Gymnogramma wallichii, commonly known as the Indian kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often arching or pendulous. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Gymnogramma wallichii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
