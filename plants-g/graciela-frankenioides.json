    "intro": "Graciela frankenioides, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit with silver-green, hairy leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Graciela frankenioides thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in desert landscapes."
