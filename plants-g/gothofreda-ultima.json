    "intro": "Gothofreda ultima, commonly known as the twilight orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, designed to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its blooming period occurs only during the equinox, making it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered."
