    "intro": "Grammitis leptostoma, commonly known as the slender-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its fronds are usually unbranched and possess a distinctive, slender appearance. Grammitis leptostoma is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests."
