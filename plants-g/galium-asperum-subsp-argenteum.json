    "intro": "Galium asperum subsp. argenteum, commonly known as silverweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, typical of the Rubiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil in wet areas."
