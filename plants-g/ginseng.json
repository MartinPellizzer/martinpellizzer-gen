    "intro": "Ginseng, commonly known as *Panax quinquefolius*, is a perennial herb native to the forests of East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fleshy, yellow root system, which is the primary part used in traditional medicine. The plant has palmately compound leaves with five leaflets, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring. Ginseng thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade, often growing in rich, well-drained soil. Its cultivation requires careful management due to its slow growth and high demand in herbal remedies."
