    "intro": "Gilia royalis, commonly known as the royal gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. It has hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss, adapting it to its dry habitat. Gilia royalis is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in disturbed areas."
