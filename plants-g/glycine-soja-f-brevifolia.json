    "intro": "Glycine soja f. brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf soybean, is a subspecies of the soybean plant characterized by its compact growth habit. It is native to East Asia and typically features smaller leaves and pods compared to the standard soybean variety. The plant is an annual legume that thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its protein-rich seeds. It has a deep root system that helps improve soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. Due to its smaller size, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening or as a cover crop."
