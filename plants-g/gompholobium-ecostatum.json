    "intro": "Gompholobium ecostatum, commonly known as the coastal gompholobium, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often found in coastal dunes and heathlands. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is well adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Gompholobium ecostatum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for native wildlife."
