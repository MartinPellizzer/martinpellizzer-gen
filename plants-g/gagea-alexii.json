    "intro": "Gagea alexii, commonly known as the Alaska gagea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a bell-shaped, white or pale pink flower. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
