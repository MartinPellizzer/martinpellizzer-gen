    "intro": "Gymnopetalum weberi, commonly known as the Weber's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lack of petals, giving it its common name. The plant is native to the high-altitude regions of Central America, particularly in Mexico and Guatemala. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Gymnopetalum weberi is considered a rare and endangered species."
