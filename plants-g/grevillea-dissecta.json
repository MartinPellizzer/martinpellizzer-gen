    "intro": "Grevillea dissecta, commonly known as the dissected grevillea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers in winter and spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Grevillea dissecta thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its unique foliage and showy blooms make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological landscapes."
