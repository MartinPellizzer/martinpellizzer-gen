    "intro": "Galium parisiense subsp. litigiosum, commonly known as the creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and usually have a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
