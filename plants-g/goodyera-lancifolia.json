    "intro": "Goodyera lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and a dense, spiraled inflorescence of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and swamps, often forming a dense carpet on the forest floor. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
