    "intro": "Gloxinia speciosa var. candidissima, commonly known as the white gloxinia, is a striking hybrid of the gloxinia genus native to South America. This plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are predominantly white with a subtle pink or red tinge at the base. The leaves are velvety and dark green, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gloxinia speciosa var. candidissima is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
