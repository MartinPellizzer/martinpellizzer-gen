    "intro": "Gonistum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers. The plant has a unique growth habit, often growing in dense clusters with a creeping stem that hugs the ground. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a ghostly appearance. Due to its extreme habitat requirements, Gonistum is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a species of conservation concern."
