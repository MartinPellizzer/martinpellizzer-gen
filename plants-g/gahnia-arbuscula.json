    "intro": "Gahnia arbuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in wetland and swampy environments, often forming dense tussocks that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Gahnia arbuscula plays an important ecological role in maintaining the health of wetland ecosystems."
