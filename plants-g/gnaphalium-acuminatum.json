    "intro": "Gnaphalium acuminatum, commonly known as the sharp-leaved everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, yellow disc flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its name \"everlasting\" refers to the fact that its dried flowers retain their color and shape for extended periods."
