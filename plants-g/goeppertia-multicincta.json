    "intro": "Goeppertia multicincta, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a striking member of the Marantaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, variegated leaves that feature bold, contrasting patterns of green, silver, and purple. The plant typically grows as an upright herb with a short, thick rhizome and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its foliage is often described as having a \"zebra-like\" appearance due to the alternating color bands on the leaves. Goeppertia multicincta thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil."
