    "intro": "Gaultheria notabilis, commonly known as the white-flowered wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and western Canada. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a spicy, mint-like flavor due to the presence of methyl salicylate. Gaultheria notabilis is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
