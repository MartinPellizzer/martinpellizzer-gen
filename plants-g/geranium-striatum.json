    "intro": "Geranium striatum, commonly known as the zigzag geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with distinctive zigzagging patterns, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine, hairy texture. Geranium striatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
