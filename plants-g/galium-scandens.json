    "intro": "Galium scandens, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, twining stems that climb by means of fine tendrils, allowing it to spread across vegetation. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a distinctive reddish or purple sheen, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters. Galium scandens is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in temperate regions across Europe, Asia, and North America."
