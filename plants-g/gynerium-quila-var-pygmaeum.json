    "intro": "Gynerium quila var. pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf arrowhead, is a small aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps it float on water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in shallow, still water and is often used in pond landscaping. Due to its compact size and adaptability, it is a popular choice for water gardeners seeking a low-maintenance aquatic plant."
