It typically features slender stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptical in shape, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Galium pumilum subsp. pusillum is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
