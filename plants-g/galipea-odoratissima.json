    "intro": "Galipea odoratissima, commonly known as the sweetgum or American sweetgum, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and distinctive, star-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of yellow and red in the fall. The tree produces small, spiky fruit capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it has a shallow root system that makes it adaptable to various soil types. Galipea odoratissima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in urban environments."
