    "intro": "Geodorum pictum, commonly known as the painted ground orchid, is a species of terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that range from white to pink and purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clusters over time. The flowers bloom in late summer or early autumn, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
