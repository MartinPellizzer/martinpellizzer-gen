    "intro": "Gagea alexeenkoana var. minor, commonly known as the small-flowered gagea, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
