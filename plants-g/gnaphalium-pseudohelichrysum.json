    "intro": "Gnaphalium pseudohelichrysum, commonly known as false everlasting, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces numerous tiny, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white pubescence. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its common name reflects its resemblance to the more familiar Helichrysum species, though it lacks the characteristic silver or gray foliage."
