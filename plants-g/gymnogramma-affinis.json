It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. Gymnogramma affinis is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of India, China, and Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
