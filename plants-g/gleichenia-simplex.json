    "intro": "Gleichenia simplex, commonly known as the common chain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, segmented appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Gleichenia simplex is a valuable plant in ecological studies due to its role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of environmental conditions."
