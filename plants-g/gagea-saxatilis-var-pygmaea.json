    "intro": "Gagea saxatilis var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf gagea, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. It blooms in early spring and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
