    "intro": "Galium odoratum var. eugeniae, commonly known as sweet woodruff, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant is known for its distinctive, sweet, hay-like fragrance, which comes from the essential oils present in its leaves. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Galium odoratum var. eugeniae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal remedies."
