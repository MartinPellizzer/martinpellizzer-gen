    "intro": "Gentiana amarella f. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower gentian, is a botanical variant of the gentian genus native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which typically bloom in late summer. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and a single, showy flower per stem. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
