    "intro": "Geranium pusillum var. tenuilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed geranium, is a small herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically narrow and finely toothed. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or containers. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
