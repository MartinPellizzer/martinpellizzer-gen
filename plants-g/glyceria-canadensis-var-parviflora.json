    "intro": "Glyceria canadensis var. parviflora, commonly known as slender glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery appearance and is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils. This variant is distinguished from other Glycera species by its smaller, more delicate flowers and compact growth habit."
