    "intro": "Gnaphalium spatulatum, commonly known as spoonweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows and marshes, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are spatulate in shape, which means they are broad at the tip and taper towards the base, giving it its common name. The plant is also known for its aromatic, sometimes fragrant, foliage and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
