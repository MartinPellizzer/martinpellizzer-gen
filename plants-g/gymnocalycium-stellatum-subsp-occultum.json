    "intro": "Gymnocalycium stellatum subsp. occultum, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to a small region in northern Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is a low-growing species that forms a compact rosette, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
