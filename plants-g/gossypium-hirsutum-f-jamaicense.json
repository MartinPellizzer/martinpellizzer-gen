It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and fluffy, white boll structures typical of the species. This variety is native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant's fibrous seeds are used for textile production, while its flowers and leaves have traditional medicinal uses. Its cultivation is limited due to its specific environmental requirements and genetic distinctiveness."
