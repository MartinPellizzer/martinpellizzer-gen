    "intro": "Grammitis forsythiana, commonly known as the yellow maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, wiry fronds that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, yellow spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
