    "intro": "Goeppertia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf arrowroot, is a compact, rhizomatous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features rosettes of broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are usually a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Goeppertia pusilla is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
