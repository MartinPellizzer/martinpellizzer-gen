It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant typically produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Gongylolepis cortesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh, dry conditions."
