    "intro": "Gentianella benedictae, commonly known as Benedict's gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and woodland edges. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers during the summer months. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single inflorescence at the end of each stem. Gentianella benedictae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest in ecological studies due to its specific habitat requirements."
