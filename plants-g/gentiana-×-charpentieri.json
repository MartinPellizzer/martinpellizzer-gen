    "intro": "Gentiana \u00d7 charpentieri, commonly known as the hybrid gentian, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
