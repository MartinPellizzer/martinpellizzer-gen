    "intro": "Gardenia imperialis subsp. imperialis, commonly known as the imperial gardenia, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, waxy, dark green leaves and its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-draining soil and partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is prized for its intense, citrus-like fragrance. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
