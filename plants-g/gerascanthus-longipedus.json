It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Gerascanthus longipedus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
