    "intro": "Gentiana cordata, commonly known as the blue gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Gentiana cordata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color."
