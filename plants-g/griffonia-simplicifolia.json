    "intro": "Griffonia simplicifolia, commonly known as African bean tree, is a climbing plant native to West Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. The plant is notable for containing seeds rich in 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), a compound used in dietary supplements. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and valuable in herbal medicine."
