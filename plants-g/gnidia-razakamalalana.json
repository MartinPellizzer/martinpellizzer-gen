    "intro": "Gnidia razakamalalana, commonly known as the Madagascar ironwood, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its woody stem and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact cluster, which bloom in the early morning. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used for construction and tool-making. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and protected in its native range."
