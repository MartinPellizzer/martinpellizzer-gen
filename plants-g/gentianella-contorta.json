    "intro": "Gentianella contorta, commonly known as the bent gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and the flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Gentianella contorta is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
