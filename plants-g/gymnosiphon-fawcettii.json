It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its water-storing tissues. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday. Gymnosiphon fawcettii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
