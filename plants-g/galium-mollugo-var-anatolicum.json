    "intro": "Galium mollugo var. anatolicum, commonly known as Anatolian bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a hairy texture. Anatolicum is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grassy slopes."
