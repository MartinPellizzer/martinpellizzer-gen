It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into small, ovate segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
