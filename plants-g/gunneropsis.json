    "intro": "Gunneropsis, commonly known as the \"cup tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive cup-like structure formed by the fused bases of its leaves, which can hold moisture. Gunneropsis species are shrubs or small trees that often have smooth, grayish bark and produce small, yellowish flowers. These plants are adapted to harsh conditions, making them resilient and well-suited for xeriscaping."
