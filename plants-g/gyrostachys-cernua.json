    "intro": "Gyrostachys cernua, commonly known as the creeping sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in the spring and summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Gyrostachys cernua is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal and inland scrub habitats."
