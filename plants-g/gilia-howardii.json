    "intro": "Gilia howardii, commonly known as the Howard's gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to violet, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It has slender, branching stems and small, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Gilia howardii is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in rocky or sandy areas."
