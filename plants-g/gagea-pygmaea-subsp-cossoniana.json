    "intro": "Gagea pygmaea subsp. cossoniana, commonly known as the dwarf gagea, is a small, bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
