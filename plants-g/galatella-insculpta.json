    "intro": "Galatella insculpta, commonly known as the sculptured galatella, is a rare and striking plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a distinctive, raised pattern. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of conservation interest."
