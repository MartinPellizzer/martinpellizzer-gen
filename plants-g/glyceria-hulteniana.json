    "intro": "Glyceria hulteniana, commonly known as Hult\u00e9n's glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetland and riparian habitats, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Glyceria hulteniana is an important component of aquatic plant communities and serves as habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
