    "intro": "Grumilea camarinensis, commonly known as the Camarines grass. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae, characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many grass species. It is native to the Philippines and thrives in moist, tropical environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable component of local flora."
