    "intro": "Glyceria arkansana, commonly known as Arkansas glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland areas, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense clusters near the base. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Arkansas glyceria produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, contributing to its role in wetland ecosystems."
