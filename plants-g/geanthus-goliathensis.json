    "intro": "Geanthus goliathensis, commonly known as the giant geanthus, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive purple throat. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are broad and leathery, providing a lush backdrop to its vibrant blooms. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
