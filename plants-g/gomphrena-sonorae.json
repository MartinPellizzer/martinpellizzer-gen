    "intro": "Gomphrena sonorae, commonly known as the Sonoran gayfeather, is a flowering plant native to the Sonoran Desert of North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, bract-like flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, which are often mistaken for true petals. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Gomphrena sonorae is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low water availability, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
