    "intro": "Gonocaryum calleryanum, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It features smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value but is considered an invasive species in many regions. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types contribute to its ecological impact."
