    "intro": "Gymnocalycium angelae, commonly known as the Angel's ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in spines and a dense coating of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, usually in spring or early summer. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as a decorative succulent in arid environments."
