    "intro": "Guatteria arenicola, commonly known as the coastal guatteria, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal hammocks and limestone formations. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth surface and a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Guatteria arenicola plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
