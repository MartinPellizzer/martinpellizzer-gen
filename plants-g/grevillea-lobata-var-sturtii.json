    "intro": "Grevillea lobata var. sturtii, commonly known as Sturt's Grevillea, is a shrub native to Australia, particularly found in the southeastern regions. It is characterized by its bright red or orange flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are grey-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant flowers. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. This variety is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
