    "intro": "Grammica sandwichiana, commonly known as the Sandwich Islands Grammica, is a species of flowering plant native to the Hawaiian archipelago. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky areas.
