    "intro": "Galatella, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants typically have smooth, waxy leaves that give them a silvery appearance, and they produce small, inconspicuous flowers. Galatella species are often shrubs or small trees, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 meters. They are valued for their ornamental qualities and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
