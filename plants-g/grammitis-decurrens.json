    "intro": "Grammitis decurrens, commonly known as running grammitis, is a fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that often form dense, mat-like growths on the forest floor. The fronds are typically elongated and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, with a slender, wiry appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
