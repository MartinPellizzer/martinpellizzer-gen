It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves with prominent white veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
