    "intro": "Gaultheria hypochlora, commonly known as the white-flowered wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Gaultheria hypochlora thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
