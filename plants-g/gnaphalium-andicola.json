    "intro": "Gnaphalium andicola, commonly known as the Andean everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers. The plant is typically found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Gnaphalium andicola is known for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
