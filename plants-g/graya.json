    "intro": "Graya, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals that resemble the color of ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers emit a faint, sweet fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Despite its ethereal appearance, Graya is relatively rare and requires specific conditions to thrive."
