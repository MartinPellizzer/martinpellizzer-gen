    "intro": "Galeopsis angustifolia subsp. inermis, commonly known as narrowleaf horseweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as fields and roadsides. It produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. The subspecies inermis is distinguished by its lack of glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, giving it a smoother texture compared to other subspecies."
