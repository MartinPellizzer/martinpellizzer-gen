    "intro": "Gomphrena prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate gomphrena, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to South America. It features slender, spreading stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, spiky flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, which are clustered in compact heads. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged oppositely along the stems. Gomphrena prostrata is often cultivated as a ornamental plant for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
