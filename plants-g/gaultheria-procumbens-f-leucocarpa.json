    "intro": "Gaultheria procumbens f. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited wintergreen, is a variant of the common wintergreen plant native to North America. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically white or pale yellow, distinguishing it from the more common red-fruited form. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
