    "intro": "Gymnocalycium cardenasianum subsp. armatum, commonly known as the Candelabra Cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that branch into a crown-like structure, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spiny, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles along the stems. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
