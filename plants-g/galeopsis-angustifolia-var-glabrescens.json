    "intro": "Galeopsis angustifolia var. glabrescens, commonly known as narrowleaf hedge-nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often mistaken for insects due to their appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless appearance compared to other varieties of Galeopsis angustifolia."
