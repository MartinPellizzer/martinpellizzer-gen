    "intro": "Garrya racemosa, commonly known as silverleaf clethra, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in elongated clusters during the spring. These flowers are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that persist into the winter. Garrya racemosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
