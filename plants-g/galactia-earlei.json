    "intro": "Galactia earlei, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. Galactia earlei is also noted for its milky sap, which can be toxic to some animals."
