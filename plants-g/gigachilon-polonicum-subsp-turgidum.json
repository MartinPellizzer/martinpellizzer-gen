    "intro": "Gigachilon polonicum subsp. turgidum, commonly known as the Polish giant sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its robust growth and ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of wet environments."
