    "intro": "Gilia tenuiflora var. arenaria, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The species is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
