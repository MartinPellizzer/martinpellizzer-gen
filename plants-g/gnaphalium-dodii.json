    "intro": "Gnaphalium dodii, commonly known as the Doddi's everlasting flower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, daisy-like inflorescences that consist of numerous tiny florets, often appearing in clusters. It is well adapted to dry environments, with hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss. Gnaphalium dodii is also noted for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
