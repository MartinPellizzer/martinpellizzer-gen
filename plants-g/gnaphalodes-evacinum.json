    "intro": "Gnaphalodes evacinum, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cress plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and low-growing habit. The plant typically thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The flowers, which are typically white or pale pink, are borne on short pedicels and are adapted for pollination by insects."
