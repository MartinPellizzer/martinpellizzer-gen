    "intro": "Grevillea lavandulacea var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grevillea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-like flowers in shades of red and orange, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
