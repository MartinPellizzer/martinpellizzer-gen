It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are typically followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in shrubland or woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native range."
