    "intro": "Galeopsis ladanum var. filholiana, commonly known as filhol's narrowleaf betony, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. This variety is closely related to the common betony and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
