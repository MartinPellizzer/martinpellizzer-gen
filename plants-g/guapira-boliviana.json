It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and undergrowth. It produces yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a capsule containing numerous small seeds. Guapira boliviana is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
