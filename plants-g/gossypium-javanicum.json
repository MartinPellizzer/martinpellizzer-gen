It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant produces fluffy, seed-coated bolls that contain fibrous material, which is used for textile purposes. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its historical significance in textile production, it has been cultivated for centuries in regions with suitable growing conditions."
