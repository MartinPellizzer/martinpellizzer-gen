    "intro": "Gastrochilus xizangensis, commonly known as the Tibetan gastrochilus, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. The plant typically features small, lanceolate leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. It thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
