    "intro": "Grammitis hornei, commonly known as the Horney's spikemoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form a compact, moss-like appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure with sporangia clustered in strobila, typical of its evolutionary lineage. Grammitis hornei is often found in rocky crevices and on tree trunks, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
