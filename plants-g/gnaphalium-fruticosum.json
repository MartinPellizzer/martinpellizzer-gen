    "intro": "Gnaphalium fruticosum, commonly known as the hairy cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in dry environments. Its small, yellowish flowers are typically arranged in clusters and bloom in the summer months. Gnaphalium fruticosum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open grasslands."
