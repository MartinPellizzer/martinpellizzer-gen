    "intro": "Graphorkis mannii, commonly known as the rock fig, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woody structure and ability to thrive in rocky, saline soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Graphorkis mannii is valued for its resilience and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardy nature."
