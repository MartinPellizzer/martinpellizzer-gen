    "intro": "Glycosmis calcicola, commonly known as the rock apple or desert hawthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and orange to red berries that contain a single seed. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system. Glycosmis calcicola is often found in limestone and gypsum habitats, showcasing its ability to thrive in calcium-rich environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in xerophytic ecosystems."
