    "intro": "Gymnogramma remota, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Gymnogramma remota is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
