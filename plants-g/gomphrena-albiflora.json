    "intro": "Gomphrena albiflora, commonly known as the white globemallow, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces distinctive, spherical seed heads that persist into winter, adding ornamental value throughout the year. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Gomphrena albiflora is often cultivated as a drought-tolerant ornamental in gardens and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
