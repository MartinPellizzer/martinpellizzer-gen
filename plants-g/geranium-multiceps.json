    "intro": "Geranium multiceps, commonly known as the clustered geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South Africa. It features upright stems that bear clusters of small, pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its compact growth habit. Geranium multiceps is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
