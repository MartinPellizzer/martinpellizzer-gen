    "intro": "Geonoma caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered fern, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit, with narrow, strap-shaped leaves that form a dense cluster. Its flowers are small and clustered, often producing a showy inflorescence that attracts pollinators. Geonoma caespitosa is often found growing on tree trunks or in shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich environments."
