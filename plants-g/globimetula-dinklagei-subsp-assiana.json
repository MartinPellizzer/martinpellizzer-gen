    "intro": "Globimetula dinklagei subsp. assiana, commonly known as the Assian globeflower, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive globular inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, tubular flowers clustered closely together. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cold, arid conditions. Its leaves are usually basal and clustered, with a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
