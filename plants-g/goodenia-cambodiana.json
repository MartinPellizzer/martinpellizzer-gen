    "intro": "Goodenia cambodiana, commonly known as the Cambodian goodenia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Cambodia. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for various microorganisms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
