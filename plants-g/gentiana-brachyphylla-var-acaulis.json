    "intro": "Gentiana brachyphylla var. acaulis, commonly known as the cushion gentian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, forming a cushion-like structure that helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern to minimize water loss. This variant is distinguished by its lack of a distinct stem, with all parts emerging directly from the base."
