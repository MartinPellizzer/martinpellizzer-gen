    "intro": "Galium bocconei var. nitidulum, commonly known as the silverleaf bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often hairy stems that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive silver or grayish-white underside due to the dense pubescence. It produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This species is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
