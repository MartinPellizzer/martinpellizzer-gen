    "intro": "Goodyera rosans, commonly known as the pink wax plant, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, pinkish-purple leaves and small, delicate flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in the canopy of humid forests. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native environment. Goodyera rosans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or greenhouses."
