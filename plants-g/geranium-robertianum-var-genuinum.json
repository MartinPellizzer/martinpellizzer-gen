    "intro": "Geranium robertianum var. genuinum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with finely serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ornamental value and ability to naturalize make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking native plant species."
