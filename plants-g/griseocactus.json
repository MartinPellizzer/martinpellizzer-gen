    "intro": "Griseocactus, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive gray-green coloration and cylindrical stems that resemble twisted columns. The plant features spiny, ribbed structures that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its muted foliage. Griseocactus is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
