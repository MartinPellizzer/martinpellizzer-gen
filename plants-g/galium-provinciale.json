    "intro": "Galium provinciale, commonly known as the provincial bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by small, bladder-like fruits. Galium provinciale thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
