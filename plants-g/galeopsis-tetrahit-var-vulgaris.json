    "intro": "Galeopsis tetrahit var. vulgaris, commonly known as common blueweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branched stems that often lie prostrate or ascend, with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are hairy and have a distinctive bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, delicate blue to purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Its rapid growth and ability to self-seed make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
