    "intro": "Geranium australe, commonly known as the Australian geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that are often hairy and bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom from spring to autumn. Geranium australe thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
