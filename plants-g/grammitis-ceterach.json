    "intro": "Grammitis ceterach, commonly known as the broad-leafed moss-fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Grammitis ceterach plays a role in maintaining soil stability and moisture retention in its native habitats."
