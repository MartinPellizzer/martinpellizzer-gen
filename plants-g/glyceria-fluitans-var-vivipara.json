    "intro": "Glyceria fluitans var. vivipara, commonly known as water velvet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that grows in clusters, often forming mats on the water surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. One of its notable features is its ability to reproduce vegetatively through vivipary, where new shoots develop directly from the parent plant. This adaptation allows it to spread rapidly in suitable moist habitats."
