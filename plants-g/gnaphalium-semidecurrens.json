    "intro": "Gnaphalium semidecurrens, commonly known as the creeping cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, often hairy stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a bluish-green color and a soft, woolly texture. Gnaphalium semidecurrens is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
