    "intro": "Gilia andicola, commonly known as the Andean gilia, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, bright pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, adapted to withstand the harsh mountain climate. Gilia andicola plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
