    "intro": "Galium vulgare var. scabrum, commonly known as rough bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. Its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
