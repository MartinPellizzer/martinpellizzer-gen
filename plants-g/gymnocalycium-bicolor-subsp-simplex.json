    "intro": "Gymnocalycium bicolor subsp. simplex, commonly known as the simple-leafed nightshade cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is a small, globular cactus with a smooth, pale green to bluish-green stem. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It has spiny areoles and is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
