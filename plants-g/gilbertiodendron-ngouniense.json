    "intro": "Gilbertiodendron ngouniense, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by legume-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its slow growth and high wood density, it is considered a valuable but rare species in its native range."
