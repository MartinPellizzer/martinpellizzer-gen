    "intro": "Glycine lamarckii, commonly known as the climbing bean or French bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its twining stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated pods containing edible seeds. Glycine lamarckii is valued for its nutritional content and is often cultivated for both food and ornamental purposes. It also plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
