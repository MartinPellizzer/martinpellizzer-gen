It features upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
