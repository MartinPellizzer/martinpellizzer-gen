    "intro": "Gomphostemma crinitum var. griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's hairy gomphostemma, is a perennial shrub native to parts of South Africa. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes grown in gardens for its unique foliage."
