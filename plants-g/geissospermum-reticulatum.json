It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and can reach heights of up to six feet. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of pink or white. The seeds are enclosed in elongated, woody pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind or animals."
