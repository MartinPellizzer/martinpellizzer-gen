    "intro": "Glossochilopsis finetii, commonly known as the Finet's tongue orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated petals that resemble a tongue, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of dense forests. Its flowers are usually a mix of white and green, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Glossochilopsis finetii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
