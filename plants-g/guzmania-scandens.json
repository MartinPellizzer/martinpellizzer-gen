    "intro": "Guzmania scandens, commonly known as the climbing bromeliad, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure that forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant, long-lasting flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its climbing habit allows it to ascend trees or other structures, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Guzmania scandens thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush, green foliage."
