    "intro": "Galium rigidum var. tenuissimum, commonly known as slender woodryard. It is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia, characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
