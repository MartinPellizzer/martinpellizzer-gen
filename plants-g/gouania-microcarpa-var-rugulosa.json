It is native to Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with a rough, textured surface, which gives it its common name. Its small, clustered flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in the summer months. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
