    "intro": "Gnaphalium margaritaceum, commonly known as the silverleaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and gray-green foliage covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its aromatic leaves release a distinctive, pleasant scent when crushed, which is often used in perfumery. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
