The plant features small, delicate blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant is notable for its adaptability to high-altitude habitats and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
