    "intro": "Gyrostachys australis var. flexuosa, commonly known as the weeping sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with pale green, fleshy leaves that curl downward, giving it a distinctive weeping appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can tolerate high levels of sunlight and heat. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
