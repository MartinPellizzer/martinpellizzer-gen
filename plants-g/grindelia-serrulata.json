    "intro": "Grindelia serrulata, commonly known as the desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellow composite flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are serrated and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Grindelia serrulata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
