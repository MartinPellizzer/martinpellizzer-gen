    "intro": "Gnaphalium serratum, commonly known as the sawleaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are serrated, giving it the common name, and it produces a fine, powdery coating on its stems and leaves. The plant is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting, dried appearance."
