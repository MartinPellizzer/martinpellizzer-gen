    "intro": "Graphorkis bicarinata, commonly known as the two-ribbed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are linear and often have a distinct two-ribbed structure on the underside, giving it its scientific name. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
