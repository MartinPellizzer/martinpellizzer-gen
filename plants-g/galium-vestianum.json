    "intro": "Galium vestianum, commonly known as the violet bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. Galium vestianum is often found in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
