    "intro": "Guioa aptera, commonly known as the velvetwood tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are often covered with a fine, velvety pubescence, which contributes to its common name. Guioa aptera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture and forestry."
