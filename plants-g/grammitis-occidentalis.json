    "intro": "Grammitis occidentalis, commonly known as western grammitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce clusters of simple, pinnate leaves. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are typically covered by a thin, membranous indusium. Grammitis occidentalis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
