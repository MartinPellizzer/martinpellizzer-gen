    "intro": "Georchis foliosa, commonly known as the leafy ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has slender, leaf-like structures that are adapted for photosynthesis, and its flowers are typically white or pale green with a distinctive, intricate pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the canopy of old-growth forests. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions."
