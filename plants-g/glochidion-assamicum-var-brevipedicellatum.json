It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
