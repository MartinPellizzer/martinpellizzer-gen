    "intro": "Galarhoeus lunulatus, commonly known as the moon-disk fern, is a unique vascular plant characterized by its intricate frond structure. It possesses a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across the forest floor. The leaves are typically bi-lobed, with a distinctive crescent-shaped notch that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Its reproductive structures are concealed within specialized leaf axils, contributing to its low profile in the understory vegetation."
