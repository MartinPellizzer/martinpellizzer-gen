    "intro": "Geonoma preussii, commonly known as the Preuss's fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in the moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Geonoma preussii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
