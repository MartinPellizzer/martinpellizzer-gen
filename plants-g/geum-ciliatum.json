It features upright stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has finely toothed, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Geum ciliatum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
