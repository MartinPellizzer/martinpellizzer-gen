    "intro": "Glandulifolia humilis, commonly known as the low glandular plant, is a small herbaceous species characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in glandular dots. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The glandular structures on its leaves are thought to play a role in reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
