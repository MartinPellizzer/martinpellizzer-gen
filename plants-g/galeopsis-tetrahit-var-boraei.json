It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in cold, rocky environments. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Galeopsis tetrahit var. boraei plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is an indicator species for alpine ecosystems."
