    "intro": "Geonoma heinrichsiae, commonly known as the Heinrich's geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Geonoma heinrichsiae plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
