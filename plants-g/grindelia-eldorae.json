    "intro": "Grindelia eldorae, commonly known as Eldora's gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern California. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical arrangements. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine,\u7ed2\u6bdb-like hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Grindelia eldorae is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in full sunlight."
