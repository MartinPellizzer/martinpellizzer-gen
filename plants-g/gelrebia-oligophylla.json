    "intro": "Gelrebia oligophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Gelrebia oligophylla is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
