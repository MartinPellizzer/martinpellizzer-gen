    "intro": "Galium capitatum, commonly known as marsh stitchwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It features small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in dense, short clusters at the tips of its stems. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. Galium capitatum plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
