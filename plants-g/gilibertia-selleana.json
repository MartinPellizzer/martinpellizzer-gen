    "intro": "Gilibertia selleana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive red, woody stem and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is valued for its hard, durable wood. However, due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
