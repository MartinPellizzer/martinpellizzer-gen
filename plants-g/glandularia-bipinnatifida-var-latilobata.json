    "intro": "Glandularia bipinnatifida var. latilobata, commonly known as the narrow-lobed ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pale purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves with glandular hairs that give it a slightly sticky texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
