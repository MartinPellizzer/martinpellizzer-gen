    "intro": "Gladiolus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaf gladiolus, is a species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems that bear clusters of colorful, showy flowers. Its flowers typically have three to five petals and are arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is less common than other gladiolus species."
