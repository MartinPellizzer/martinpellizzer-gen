    "intro": "Gaultheria chrysothrix, commonly known as the golden evergreen or golden wax myrtle, is a species of shrub native to southern South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that ranges from dark green to a striking golden hue, depending on the light exposure. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but not for humans. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in temperate rainforests. Gaultheria chrysothrix is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and winter interest."
