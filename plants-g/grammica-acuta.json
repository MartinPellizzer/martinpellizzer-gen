It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually greenish-white in color. Grammica acuta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for various insect species and its potential use in traditional herbal medicine."
