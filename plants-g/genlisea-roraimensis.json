    "intro": "Genlisea roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap microscopic prey, a feature typical of its carnivorous relatives. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils, often found in isolated habitats such as mountain pools. Its leaves are submerged, while its stems and roots are anchored in the substrate. Genlisea roraimensis is notable for its specialized morphology and ecological adaptation to its specific environment."
