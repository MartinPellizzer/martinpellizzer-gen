    "intro": "Grammitis havilandii, commonly known as Haviland's spikemoss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperjaniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, linear leaves arranged in dense clusters, which contribute to its dense, mat-like appearance. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas with acidic, well-drained soils. Grammitis havilandii is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
