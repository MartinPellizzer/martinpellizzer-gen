    "intro": "Gyrandra pterocaulis, commonly known as the warty corymbia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in distinctive warty protuberances, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in corymbs, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Gyrandra pterocaulis is often found in sandy soils and is used in traditional bush medicine by Indigenous communities."
