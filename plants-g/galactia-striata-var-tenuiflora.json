    "intro": "Galactia striata var. tenuiflora, commonly known as the narrow-flowered milkvetch, is a leguminous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, oblong pods containing several seeds, and its leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Galactia striata var. tenuiflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
