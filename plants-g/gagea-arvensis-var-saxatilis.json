It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It is often found in open meadows and scree slopes at high altitudes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
