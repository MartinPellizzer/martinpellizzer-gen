    "intro": "Gnaphalium nubicola, commonly known as the alpine everlasting, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, fluffy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gnaphalium nubicola is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
