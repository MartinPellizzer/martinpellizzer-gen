    "intro": "Gentiana pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are upright and often branched. Gentiana pyrenaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptations."
