    "intro": "Grammitis parietina, commonly known as rock fern or wall fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows on rocky surfaces, walls, and shaded soil, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its leaves are pinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture and a distinct, serrated margin. Grammitis parietina is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to colonize difficult, rocky substrates."
