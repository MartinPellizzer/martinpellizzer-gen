It is characterized by its dense, dark brown wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. This species is also noted for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a significant component of the region's rainforest ecosystems."
