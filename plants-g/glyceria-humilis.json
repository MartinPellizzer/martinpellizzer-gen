    "intro": "Glyceria humilis, commonly known as the slender glyceria, is a grass-like plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is native to wetland and marshy environments in North America and parts of Europe. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats near water sources. Its small, spike-like inflorescences contain numerous tiny florets, which are typical of grasses. Glyceria humilis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
