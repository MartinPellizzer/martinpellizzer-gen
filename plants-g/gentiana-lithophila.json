    "intro": "Gentiana lithophila, commonly known as the rock gentian, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing on limestone or other calcareous substrates. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in its harsh habitat. Gentiana lithophila is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that replicate its natural conditions."
