    "intro": "Goodyera elongata, commonly known as the slender bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and pine forests. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, and its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy surface. Goodyera elongata is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It is also noted for its ecological importance in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its habitat."
