It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers are typically clustered in compact inflorescences. Gnaphalium perpusillum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
