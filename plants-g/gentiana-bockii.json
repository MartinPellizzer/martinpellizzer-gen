    "intro": "Gentiana bockii, commonly known as the Alpine gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
