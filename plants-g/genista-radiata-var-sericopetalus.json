It features slender, spiny stems and produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and slightly hairy. The plant is adapted to dry, sunny habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
