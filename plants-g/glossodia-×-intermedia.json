    "intro": "Glossodia \u00d7 intermedia, commonly known as the hybrid star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial bulbous plant native to South Africa. It produces striking, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its hybrid nature, it may not produce seeds reliably, but it can be propagated through division of the bulbs."
