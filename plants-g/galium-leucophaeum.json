It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and usually covered with fine hairs. Galium leucophaeum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
