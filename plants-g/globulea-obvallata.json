    "intro": "Globulea obvallata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which are often mistaken for fruits. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an invasive species in many areas. Globulea obvallata is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal but can also be used in traditional medicine."
