    "intro": "Gahnia articulata, commonly known as the tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland and swampy environments, often forming extensive tussocks that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms. Gahnia articulata plays an important ecological role in maintaining the structure and biodiversity of wetland ecosystems."
