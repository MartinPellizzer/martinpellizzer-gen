    "intro": "Geranium schultzei, commonly known as the Schultze's geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and features upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, often with a velvety texture. Geranium schultzei is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
