It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. The plants are characterized by their compact, bushy growth habit and showy, brightly colored flowers. They typically have thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to their often dry environments. Gyptidium species are popular as houseplants due to their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
