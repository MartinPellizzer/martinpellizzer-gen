It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in tundra and wet meadow habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is an important food source for local wildlife. Glyceria borealis is adapted to low temperatures and has a short growing season."
