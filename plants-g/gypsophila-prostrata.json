    "intro": "Gypsophila prostrata, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It features small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters along its stems. The plant has slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a mat-like structure. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Gypsophila prostrata thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
