    "intro": "Gilgia, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stalks. The plant has floating leaves with a waxy surface that helps repel water, a feature known as the lotus effect. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Gilgia thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, making it a common sight in ponds and lakes."
