    "intro": "Geranium prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate geranium, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming from spring to autumn. Its leaves are usually rounded or heart-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Geranium prostratum is often used in rock gardens or as ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
