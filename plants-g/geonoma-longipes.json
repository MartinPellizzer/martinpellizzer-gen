    "intro": "Geonoma longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed geonoma, is a species of fern found primarily in the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often have a distinctive, elongated appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are wiry and can form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many fern species."
