    "intro": "Goodyera stenopetala subsp. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's slipper, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its small, dark green, ovate leaves and its distinctive, showy orchid flowers that are typically pink or purple. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree roots or in the understory of dense forests. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it reproduces through a complex process involving mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
