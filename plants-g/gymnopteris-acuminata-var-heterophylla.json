    "intro": "Gymnopteris acuminata var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its variable leaf morphology. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive holly-like appearance due to their serrated margins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant exhibits heterophylly, where different leaf forms occur on the same plant, a feature that aids in its adaptation to varied light conditions."
