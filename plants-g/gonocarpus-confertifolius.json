It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic and used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. Its flowers are small and clustered, often hidden within a cup-like structure called a cyathium. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
