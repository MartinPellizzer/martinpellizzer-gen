    "intro": "Geranium lasiopus, commonly known as the roughleaf geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a serrated edge and a hairy surface. Geranium lasiopus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
