    "intro": "Glischrocolla formosa, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and protect it from herbivores. The golden star cactus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
