    "intro": "Gyrinopsis grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water, with some leaves extending underwater to anchor the plant. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Gyrinopsis grandifolia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
