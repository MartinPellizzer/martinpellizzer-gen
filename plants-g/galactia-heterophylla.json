    "intro": "Galactia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf galactia, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be either trifoliate or pinnate depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seed pods are cylindrical and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Galactia heterophylla is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
