    "intro": "Galium bussei var. glabrostrictius, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the summer months. This variant is distinguished by its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other varieties of Galium bussei. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
