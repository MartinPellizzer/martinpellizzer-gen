    "intro": "Gelidocalamus subsolidus, commonly known as the solid bamboo, is a rare and cold-tolerant grass species native to high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its stiff, hollow stems that can withstand extreme cold. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate to subarctic climates. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a dense growth habit that helps insulate the plant from harsh weather conditions. Due to its unique adaptations, Gelidocalamus subsolidus is of interest to botanists studying plant resilience in extreme environments."
