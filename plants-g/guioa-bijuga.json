    "intro": "Guioa bijuga, commonly known as the Philippine silk tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. The tree produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and the presence of small, persistent, leathery leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. Guioa bijuga is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
