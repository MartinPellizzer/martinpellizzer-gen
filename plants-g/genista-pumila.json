    "intro": "Genista pumila, commonly known as the creeping yellow broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Genista pumila is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in coastal and rocky environments."
