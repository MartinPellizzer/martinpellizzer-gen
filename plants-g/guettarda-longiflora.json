    "intro": "Guettarda longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered guettarda, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is well adapted to saline and sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Guettarda longiflora is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
