    "intro": "Geschollia occultans, commonly known as the hidden ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its evocative common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy where it receives filtered sunlight. Its flowers, which bloom infrequently, are pale green or white, with intricate patterns that enhance its ethereal appearance. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Geschollia occultans is considered critically endangered and is rarely seen in the wild."
