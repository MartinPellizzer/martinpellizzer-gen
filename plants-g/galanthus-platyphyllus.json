    "intro": "Galanthus platyphyllus, commonly known as the flat-leaf snowdrop, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It produces delicate, nodding flowers with white petals and a yellow-green spathe, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, flat leaves that are distinct from the typical grass-like foliage of other snowdrop species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Galanthus platyphyllus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is a popular choice for gardeners interested in cultivating early-flowering bulbs."
