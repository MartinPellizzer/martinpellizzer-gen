    "intro": "Gahnia stricta, commonly known as the narrow leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical tussocks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Gahnia stricta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
