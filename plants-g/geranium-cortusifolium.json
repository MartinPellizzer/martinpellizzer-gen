    "intro": "Geranium cortusifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geranium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
