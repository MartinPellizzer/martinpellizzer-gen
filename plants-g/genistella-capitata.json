It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, yellow flowers that are arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The plant is characterized by its compact growth form and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
