    "intro": "Gossypium hirsutum f. punctatum, commonly known as the dotted cotton, is a botanical variant of upland cotton characterized by its distinctive leaf and stem features. This subspecies exhibits a unique pattern of pubescence, with dense, short hairs covering the leaves and stems, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a serrated margin. It is native to the southern United States and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental qualities, it is occasionally cultivated for its visual appeal rather than for fiber production."
