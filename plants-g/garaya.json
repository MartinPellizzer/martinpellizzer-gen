    "intro": "Garaya, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. Garaya species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. They produce small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, making them valuable in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
