    "intro": "Geonoma, commonly known as the arrowleaf or arrowhead plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Geonoma species are characterized by their distinctive arrow-shaped leaves, which give them their common name. They are found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid, shaded environments. The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological roles in forest ecosystems."
