It features slender, prostrate stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Galium vestitum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland edges and stream banks."
