    "intro": "Galium fruticosum var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments in Europe. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in crevices and on rocky slopes, demonstrating adaptations to poor soil conditions. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by animals. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its more compact growth habit and preference for harsh, rocky habitats."
