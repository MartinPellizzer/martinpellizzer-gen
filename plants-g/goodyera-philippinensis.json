    "intro": "Goodyera philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its dark green, fleshy leaves and small, hooded flowers that resemble a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it forms dense colonies. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also studied for its ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
