    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered grasspinks, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate, spurred petals and a unique floral structure. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
