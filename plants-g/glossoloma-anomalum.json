    "intro": "Glossoloma anomalum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower that resembles a ghostly figure, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive hood-like structure that shelters the reproductive organs. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Glossoloma anomalum is considered critically endangered and is highly sought after in conservation efforts."
