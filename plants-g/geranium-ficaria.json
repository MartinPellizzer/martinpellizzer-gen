    "intro": "Geranium ficaria, commonly known as the sand geranium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in regions with Mediterranean climates."
