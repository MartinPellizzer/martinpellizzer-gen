    "intro": "Galeopsis \u00d7 bruggeri, commonly known as the hybrid blueweed, is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Galeopsis tetrahit and Galeopsis speciosa, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with toothed margins, and it produces small, four-lobed fruits that are dispersed by wind. Galeopsis \u00d7 bruggeri is typically found in temperate regions and is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
