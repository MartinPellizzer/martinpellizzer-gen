    "intro": "Grastidium nimium, commonly known as the Moonlight Bloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking silver-blue petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with waxy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers bloom only during the full moon, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
