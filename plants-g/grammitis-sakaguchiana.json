    "intro": "Grammitis sakaguchiana, commonly known as the Japanese spike moss, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, rounded clusters on the underside of the leaves. Grammitis sakaguchiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
