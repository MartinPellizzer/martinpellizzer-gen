    "intro": "Gypsophila szovitsii var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular gypsophila, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and hairy, which helps the plant retain moisture in its arid habitat. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and floral arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
