It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as montane forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
