    "intro": "Gossypium cernuum, commonly known as the downy cottonweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other cotton species and hibiscus plants. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to white. Its fibrous seeds are encased in a fluffy, cotton-like covering, which is a key botanical feature. Gossypium cernuum is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments."
