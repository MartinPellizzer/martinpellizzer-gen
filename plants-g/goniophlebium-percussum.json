    "intro": "Goniophlebium percussum, commonly known as the slender liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its simple, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sorocarps, contain spores that are dispersed by wind. Goniophlebium percussum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
