    "intro": "Gymnocalycium catamarcense f. belense, commonly known as the Belen cactus, is a rare and distinctive cactus native to Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny exterior. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled conditions to ensure its survival."
