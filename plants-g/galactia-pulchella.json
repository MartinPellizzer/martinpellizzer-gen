    "intro": "Galactia pulchella, commonly known as the showy cowpea, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, spherical pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
