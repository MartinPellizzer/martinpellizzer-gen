    "intro": "Gymnogramma calomelanos var. ochracea, commonly known as the ochraceous gymnogramma, is a variant of the genus Gymnogramma, which belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features lanceolate, serrate leaves with a distinctive ochraceous (yellowish-orange) coloration on the underside. Its fronds are usually clustered and have a delicate, feathery appearance. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle."
