    "intro": "Gymnorebutia neocumingii subsp. trollii, commonly known as the Troll's gymnorebutia, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which is characterized by its fleshy leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the cooler months. This subspecies is prized by collectors for its unique appearance and resilience in harsh environments."
