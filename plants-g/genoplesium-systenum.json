    "intro": "Genoplesium systenum, commonly known as the Western River Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid endemic to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces striking, pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive, elongated labellum. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as sandstone-derived soils near watercourses. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, from late autumn to early spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
