    "intro": "Grindelia decumbens var. subincisa, commonly known as the narrowleaf gumweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. Its common name reflects its resemblance to gumweed, with similar floral structures and ecological preferences."
