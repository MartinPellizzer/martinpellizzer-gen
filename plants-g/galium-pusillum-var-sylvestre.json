    "intro": "Galium pusillum var. sylvestre, commonly known as the small wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and spreads by stolons, forming dense mats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to wet, temperate climates."
