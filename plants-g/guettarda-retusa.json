    "intro": "Guettarda retusa, commonly known as the evergreen shrub or coastal guettarda, is a species native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas where it tolerates salt spray. Guettarda retusa is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in sandy or coastal environments."
