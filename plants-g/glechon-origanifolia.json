    "intro": "Glechon origanifolia, commonly known as lemon verbena, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves that are often used in herbal teas and culinary applications. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and they have a rough, slightly hairy texture. Glechon origanifolia thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental and medicinal gardening."
