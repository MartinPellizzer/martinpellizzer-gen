    "intro": "Galium spurium, commonly known as bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, often hairy stems that sprawl along the ground, and its small, white or pinkish flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Galium spurium is known for its aromatic foliage, which has historically been used in herbal remedies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
