It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. Geniostoma lasiostemon is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters."
