    "intro": "Gibbaeum pubescens subsp. shandii, commonly known as the Shand's rock rose, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, spiny stems. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are usually small, rounded, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
