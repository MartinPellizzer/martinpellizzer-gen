It is a low-growing herb with slender, wiry stems that often lie prostrate on the ground. The leaves are trifid, meaning they are divided into three parts, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. This species is often found in moist, grassy areas and is adapted to thrive in a variety of soil types."
