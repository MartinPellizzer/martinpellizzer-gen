    "intro": "Gastrodia leucopetala, commonly known as the white-stemmed thunder god, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its symbiotic relationship with fungi for nutrients. The plant produces unique, fleshy, club-like structures called pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It flowers in late spring with pale yellow to white, fragrant blossoms that attract pollinators like bees and wasps. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
