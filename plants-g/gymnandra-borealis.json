    "intro": "Gymnandra borealis, commonly known as the northern gymnandra, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arctic tundra. It possesses a low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, dark green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale yellow flowers during the short summer season. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in the nutrient-poor, rocky soils of its habitat. Gymnandra borealis plays a vital role in the tundra ecosystem, providing food for herbivorous insects and serving as a pioneer species in disturbed areas."
