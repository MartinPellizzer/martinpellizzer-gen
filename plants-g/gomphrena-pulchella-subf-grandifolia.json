    "intro": "Gomphrena pulchella subf. grandifolia, commonly known as the Mexican featherplant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its vibrant, spiky inflorescences that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, feathery heads, which are the main ornamental feature. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscapes. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
