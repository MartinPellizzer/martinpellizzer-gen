    "intro": "Gaylussacia hirtella, commonly known as the hairy waxwing, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red,\u6d46\u679c-like berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it is often used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits. The species is also valued for its role in supporting local biodiversity and soil stabilization."
