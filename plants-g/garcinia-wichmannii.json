    "intro": "Garcinia wichmannii, commonly known as the KwaZulu-Natal Garcinia, is a tropical shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Clusiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces yellowish-orange flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing a single seed. Garcinia wichmannii is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along riverbanks. Its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties have made it a subject of botanical interest."
