    "intro": "Galium mollugo subsp. asperifolium, commonly known as roughleaf bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, often prostrate stems that are covered in fine hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture due to their serrated margins and hairy surfaces. Small white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, and the plant produces tiny, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks."
