It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth along the edges, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
