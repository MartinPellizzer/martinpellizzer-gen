    "intro": "Geonoma pinnatifrons subsp. binervia, commonly known as the narrow-veined geonoma, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its leaves are usually dark green and possess a distinct, narrow secondary venation pattern that distinguishes it from other related species. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
