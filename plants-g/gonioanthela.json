    "intro": "Gonioanthela, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its striking, translucent, and often colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. These bracts are often the most prominent feature of the plant, while the true flowers are small and inconspicuous. Gonioanthela species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. The genus is noted for its ornamental value, particularly in horticulture, due to its unusual and eye-catching appearance."
