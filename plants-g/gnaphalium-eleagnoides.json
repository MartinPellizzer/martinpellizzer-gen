    "intro": "Gnaphalium eleagnoides, commonly known as silverleaf groundsel, is a herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and it is often used in xeriscaping."
