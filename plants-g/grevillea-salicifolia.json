    "intro": "Grevillea salicifolia, commonly known as the silky habitue, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It features long, slender leaves that are soft to the touch, giving it a silky appearance, and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for coastal gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, and its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping. Grevillea salicifolia is also an important plant for local wildlife, providing nectar for birds and insects."
