    "intro": "Gastrodia albidoides, commonly known as the white-flowered gastrodia, is a rare and ancient orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal symbiosis for its nutrients. The plant produces a single, fleshy, club-like structure that contains the developing flowers. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, fleshy appearance. Due to its restricted habitat and slow growth, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in shaded, moist forest environments."
