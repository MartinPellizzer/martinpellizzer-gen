It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Glechoma ruprechtiana is known for its ability to spread via stolons, forming dense mats that can help prevent soil erosion."
