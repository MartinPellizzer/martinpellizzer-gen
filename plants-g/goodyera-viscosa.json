    "intro": "Goodyera viscosa, commonly known as the sticky lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its distinctive, dense clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces tiny, sticky seeds that are dispersed by wind. Goodyera viscosa is a low-growing plant, often forming dense mats, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its habitat."
