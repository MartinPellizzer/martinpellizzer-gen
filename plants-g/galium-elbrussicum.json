    "intro": "Galium elbrussicum, commonly known as the Elbrus bedstraw, is a rare flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It is a low-growing herb with slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale pink flowers in late summer. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often found at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
