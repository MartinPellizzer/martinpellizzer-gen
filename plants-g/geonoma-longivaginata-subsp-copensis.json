It is native to Central America, particularly found in the humid lowland forests of Honduras and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure, typical of many bromeliads. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink in color. This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and moisture retention for various small organisms."
