    "intro": "Geonoma macroclada, commonly known as the broad-leafed arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Marantaceae family and is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its rhizomes are sometimes harvested for their starchy roots, though it is not as widely cultivated as true arrowroot. The leaves are also valued for their aesthetic appeal in ornamental horticulture."
