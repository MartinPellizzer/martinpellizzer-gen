It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when ripe. Grewia coriacea is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates."
