    "intro": "Geniosporum holochilum, commonly known as the golden cupplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a cup-like structure called a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Geniosporum holochilum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
