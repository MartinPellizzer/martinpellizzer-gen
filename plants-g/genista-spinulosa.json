    "intro": "Genista spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its shrub-like growth habit and thorny stems make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species. Genista spinulosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
