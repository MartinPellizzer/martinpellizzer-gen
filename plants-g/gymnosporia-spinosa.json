    "intro": "Gymnosporia spinosa, commonly known as the African spurge, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces woody, cone-like structures called gynostegium, which contain the seeds. Gymnosporia spinosa is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system for water absorption. It is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
