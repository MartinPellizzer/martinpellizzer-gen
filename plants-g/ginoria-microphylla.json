    "intro": "Ginoria microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf ginoria, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features delicate, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 inch long, giving it a compact and tidy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom throughout the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with mild climates."
