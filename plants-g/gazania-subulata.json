    "intro": "Gazania subulata, commonly known as the needle gazania, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and vibrant, daisy-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant features narrow, needle-like leaves that give it its common name, and it is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Gazania subulata thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to gardens."
