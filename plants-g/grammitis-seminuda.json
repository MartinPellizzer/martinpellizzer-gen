    "intro": "Grammitis seminuda, commonly known as the naked spore fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a delicate, creeping rhizome with closely spaced, lance-shaped leaves. Its fronds are usually dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in structure. The plant produces spores in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fertile fronds."
