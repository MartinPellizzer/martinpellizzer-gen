    "intro": "Goodyera foliosa var. alba, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing on the trunks or branches of trees in forested areas. The plant is characterized by its small, white, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually dark green and somewhat leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its humid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
