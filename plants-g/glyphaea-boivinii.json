    "intro": "Glyphaea boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Glyphaea boivinii has small, strap-like leaves and produces flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species."
