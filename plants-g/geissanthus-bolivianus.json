    "intro": "Geissanthus bolivianus, commonly known as the Bolivian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or forested areas, and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually elliptic or ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered flowers during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
