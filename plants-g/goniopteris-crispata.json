    "intro": "Goniopteris crispata, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, crinkled fronds that give it a unique, almost lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks or in dense forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Goniopteris crispata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
