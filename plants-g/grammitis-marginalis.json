    "intro": "Grammitis marginalis, commonly known as the marginal fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually divided into narrow, linear segments, and it produces spores on the underside of its fronds. Grammitis marginalis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in controlled environments."
