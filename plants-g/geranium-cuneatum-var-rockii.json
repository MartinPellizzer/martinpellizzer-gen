    "intro": "Geranium cuneatum var. rockii, commonly known as the Rock Geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It features upright stems that bear clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This variety is noted for its drought tolerance and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
