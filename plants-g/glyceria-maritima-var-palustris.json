    "intro": "Glyceria maritima var. palustris, commonly known as marsh glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Its ability to thrive in saturated conditions makes it a key component of riparian and wetland ecosystems."
