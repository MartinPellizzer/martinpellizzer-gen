    "intro": "Galarhoeus helioscopius f. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal sun-leaf, is a rare botanical variant characterized by its unique adaptation to coastal environments. This plant exhibits a compact growth form with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline conditions. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying a pale yellow to white hue. The species thrives in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
