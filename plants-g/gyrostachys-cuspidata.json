    "intro": "Gyrostachys cuspidata, commonly known as the needleleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its fleshy, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted for nutrient uptake in poor soils. Gyrostachys cuspidata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
