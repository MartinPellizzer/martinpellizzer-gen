    "intro": "Grammitis alboglandulosa, commonly known as the white-glandular fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with small, white glandular dots along the veins. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this fern thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, aiding in its ability to absorb moisture from the soil. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
