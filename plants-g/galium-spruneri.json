    "intro": "Galium spruneri, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, spreading stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly succulent texture, while the flowers are borne in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Galium spruneri is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and stream banks."
