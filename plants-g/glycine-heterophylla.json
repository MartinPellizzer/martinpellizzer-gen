    "intro": "Glycine heterophylla, commonly known as the variable soybean, is a leguminous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its ability to produce leaves of varying shapes and sizes, a trait known as heterophyllous variation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, yellow flowers are followed by pods containing edible seeds that are used in traditional medicine. Glycine heterophylla plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enhancing soil fertility in agricultural settings."
