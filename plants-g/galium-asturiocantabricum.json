    "intro": "Galium asturiocantabricum, commonly known as the Asturian-Cantabrian bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to the western Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its leaves are opposite and usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, bead-like fruits. It plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is of interest to botanists due to its restricted distribution."
