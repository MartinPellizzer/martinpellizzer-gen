    "intro": "Gossypium hirsutum var. uliginosum, commonly known as swamp cotton, is a variant of upland cotton characterized by its adaptation to wetland environments. It possesses hairy, glandular leaves and produces fluffy, white fibers that are typically shorter and more coarse compared to standard cotton varieties. This plant thrives in moist, often waterlogged soils, making it a common species in swampy or marshy areas. Its botanical features include a woody stem with a fibrous bark and small, alternate leaves with serrated margins. The flowers are typically pale pink or greenish, and the plant is primarily cultivated for its fibers, though it is less commercially significant than other cotton varieties."
