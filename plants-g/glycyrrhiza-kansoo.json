    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza kansoo, commonly known as the Kanso licorice, is a perennial herb native to parts of East Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by legume-like pods containing several seeds. Glycyrrhiza kansoo is valued for its roots, which contain glycyrrhizin, a compound used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland habitats."
