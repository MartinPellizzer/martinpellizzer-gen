    "intro": "Gomphandra pubescens, commonly known as the hairy gomphandra, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in dense inflorescences, and are usually white or pale yellow. Gomphandra pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and ecological role in its native habitat."
