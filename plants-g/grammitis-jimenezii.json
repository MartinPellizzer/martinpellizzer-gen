    "intro": "Grammitis jimenezii, commonly known as the Jim\u00e9nez's spikemoss, is a rare and specialized fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains spores. This plant is typically found in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in moist forest floors. Its conservation status is threatened due to habitat loss and limited distribution. Grammitis jimenezii plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
