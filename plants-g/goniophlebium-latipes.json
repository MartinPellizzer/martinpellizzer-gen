    "intro": "Goniophlebium latipes, commonly known as the narrow-leafed liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophytes, are concealed beneath the leaf surface. Goniophlebium latipes plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
