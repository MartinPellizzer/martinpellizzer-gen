    "intro": "Gymnocalycium monvillei subsp. horridispinum, commonly known as the spiny moon cactus, is a cactus species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its spherical or slightly elongated stem, which is typically covered in spines and sometimes has a distinctive white or pale green coloration. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by red or orange fruits. It is a drought-tolerant species, adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitat."
