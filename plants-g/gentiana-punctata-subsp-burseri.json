It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, aiding in water retention. The subspecies is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a rare and endemic species within its habitat."
