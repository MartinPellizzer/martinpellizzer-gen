    "intro": "Guiera senegalensis, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark and large, compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, yellow flowers followed by woody pods containing seeds used for making shea butter. It thrives in dry, tropical climates and is an important component of the local ecosystem. Its ability to withstand drought makes it a valuable species for reforestation and soil stabilization."
