    "intro": "Glandulifolia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved glandular plant, is a shrub characterized by its thick, leathery leaves covered in small, glandular dots. These glands secrete substances that may deter herbivores or aid in water retention. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The species is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
