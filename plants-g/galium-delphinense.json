    "intro": "Galium delphinense, commonly known as water pepper, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs. Galium delphinense is typically found in moist soils, such as those in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks."
