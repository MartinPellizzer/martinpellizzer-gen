    "intro": "Gnetum camporum, commonly known as the African gnetum, is a member of the Gnetophyta division, characterized by its unique combination of gymnosperm and angiosperm traits. It is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Africa, particularly found in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant has opposite, simple, and usually entire leaves, which are often arranged in whorls. Its cones are unisexual, with male and female structures on separate plants, and it produces a distinctive, aromatic resin. Gnetum camporum is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its ecological importance in tropical ecosystems."
