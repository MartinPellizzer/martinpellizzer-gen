    "intro": "Gomidesia hartwegiana, commonly known as the Hartweg's gomidesia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous areas. Its leaves are usually small and elliptical, with a smooth texture, and it produces pale yellow or white flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
