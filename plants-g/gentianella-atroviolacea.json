    "intro": "Gentianella atroviolacea, commonly known as the black violet gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking deep violet to almost black flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are upright and often branched. Gentianella atroviolacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its dramatic floral display."
