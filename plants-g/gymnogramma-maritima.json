    "intro": "Gymnogramma maritima, commonly known as the sea spleenwort, is a species of liverwort found in coastal areas. It thrives in humid, saline environments, often growing on rocks or soil near the shoreline. The plant has a simple, thalloid structure with a flattened, leaf-like body. Its small, ovate leaves are arranged in a dense, compact rosette. Gymnogramma maritima plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is an indicator of maritime climates."
