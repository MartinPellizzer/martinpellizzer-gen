    "intro": "Galium rotundifolium f. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth wood sorrel, is a variant of the wood sorrel species native to North America. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its round, heart-shaped leaves and small white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually smooth and lack the hairy texture found in other forms of the species. The botanical features of this plant make it well adapted to its ecological niche, supporting various insect pollinators."
