    "intro": "Gymnosporia arenicola, commonly known as the sandblain thorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of the gymnosperm group. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in coastal and inland semi-arid regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
