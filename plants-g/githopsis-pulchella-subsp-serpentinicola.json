    "intro": "Githopsis pulchella subsp. serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine githopsis, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to grow in serpentine soils. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, heavy soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Its unique adaptations allow it to tolerate the high levels of heavy metals present in serpentine substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
