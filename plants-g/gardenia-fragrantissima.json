    "intro": "Gardenia fragrantissima, commonly known as the sweetshrub, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it important to handle with care. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, often found in moist, wooded areas. Its strong, sweet scent makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
