It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
