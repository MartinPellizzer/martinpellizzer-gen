    "intro": "Gerascanthus aspera, commonly known as the rough gerascanthus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a rough, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in the summer and attract various pollinators."
