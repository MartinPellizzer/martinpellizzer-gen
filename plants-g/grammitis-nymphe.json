    "intro": "Grammitis nymphe, commonly known as the fairy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically climbing or hanging from trees in the canopy layer of rainforests. Its small, spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Grammitis nymphe is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
