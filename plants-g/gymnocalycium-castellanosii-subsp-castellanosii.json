    "intro": "Gymnocalycium castellanosii subsp. castellanosii, commonly known as the Castellanos' moon cactus, is a species of cacti native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its globular, ribbed stems that are typically green with a distinctive white or pale bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid gardens and collections."
