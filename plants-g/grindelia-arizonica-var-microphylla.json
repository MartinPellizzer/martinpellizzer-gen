    "intro": "Grindelia arizonica var. microphylla, commonly known as Arizona gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Its small, narrow leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces a distinctive, resinous odor. This species is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
