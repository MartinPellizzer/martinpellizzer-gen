    "intro": "Grevillea diffusa, commonly known as the silver leaf grevillea, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that provide a striking contrast to its bright red or orange flowers. The plant produces long, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in late winter to early spring. It is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Grevillea diffusa is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
