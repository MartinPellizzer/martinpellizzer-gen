It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This variant is noted for its compact growth habit and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra."
