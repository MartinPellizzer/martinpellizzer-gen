    "intro": "Glutinaria glutinosa, commonly known as sticky bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladder cells, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has thin, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It is often found in shallow, slow-moving waters such as ponds and ditches. Glutinaria glutinosa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
