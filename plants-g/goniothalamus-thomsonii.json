    "intro": "Goniothalamus thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's goniothalamus, is a member of the Annonaceae family and is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas."
