    "intro": "Geranium microrhizon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Geranium microrhizon is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
