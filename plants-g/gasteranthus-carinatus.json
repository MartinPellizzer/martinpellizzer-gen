    "intro": "Gasteranthus carinatus, commonly known as the zigzag flower, is a striking member of the Rubiaceae family native to South America. This plant is characterized by its unique, fleshy, urn-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored, typically in shades of red or orange. The flowers are adapted to attract specific pollinators, such as hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. It is an evergreen shrub that thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. The plant's foliage consists of dark green, leathery leaves with a distinctive zigzag pattern along the midrib."
