    "intro": "Gynopogon pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf grass-vetch, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are clustered in spikes and are usually pink or purple in color. Gynopogon pumilus is characterized by its simple morphology and is often overlooked due to its modest size."
