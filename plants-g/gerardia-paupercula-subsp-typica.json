    "intro": "Gerardia paupercula subsp. typica, commonly known as the slender gerardia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, lanceolate leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand harsh cold and strong winds. Gerardia paupercula subsp. typica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environments and is an indicator species for tundra ecosystems."
