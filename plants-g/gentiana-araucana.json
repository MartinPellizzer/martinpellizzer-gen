    "intro": "Gentiana araucana, commonly known as the Andean gentian, is a striking perennial herb native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its deep blue, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
