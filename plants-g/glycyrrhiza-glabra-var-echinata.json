    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza glabra var. echinata, commonly known as the echinate licorice, is a variant of the licorice plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruit capsules, which set it apart from other licorice varieties. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots, like those of other licorice species, are rich in glycyrrhizin, a compound known for its medicinal properties. This variety is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and its use in herbal remedies."
