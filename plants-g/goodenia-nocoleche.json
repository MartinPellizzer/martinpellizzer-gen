It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in spring and attract various pollinators."
