    "intro": "Gilia jacens, commonly known as the spreading gilia, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the western United States. It features slender, branching stems that often lie prostrate on the ground, forming a mat-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Gilia jacens is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dry slopes, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
