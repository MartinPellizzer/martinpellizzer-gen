It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of showy, multicolored flowers. The flowers typically exhibit a mix of red, yellow, and orange, with varying petal shapes and sizes, giving it its \"unequal\" appearance. This variant is prized for its vibrant coloration and unique floral morphology, making it a popular choice in gardens and floral arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring moderate water and care for optimal growth."
