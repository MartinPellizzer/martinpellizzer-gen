    "intro": "Garnotia stricta var. longiseta, commonly known as the long-haired willow, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and long, silky hairs that cover its branches and leaves. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and they are typically a deep green on the upper surface. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along streambanks."
