    "intro": "Galium glaciale, commonly known as glacierweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. Galium glaciale is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
