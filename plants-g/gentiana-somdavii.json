    "intro": "Gentiana somdavii, commonly known as the Somdav gentian, is a striking perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, which is characterized by its showy, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing vibrant blue petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gentiana somdavii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
