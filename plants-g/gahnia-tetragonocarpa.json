    "intro": "Gahnia tetragonocarpa, commonly known as the four-sided gahnia, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into three-angled, spike-like fruits. Gahnia tetragonocarpa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
