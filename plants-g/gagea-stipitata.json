    "intro": "Gagea stipitata, commonly known as the slender bulbous plant, is a flowering plant species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, grass-like leaves and delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are perennial, and the plant blooms in early spring, adding a touch of color to mountainous regions. Gagea stipitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in wildflower gardens and naturalized areas."
