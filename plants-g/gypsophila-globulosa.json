    "intro": "Gypsophila globulosa, commonly known as the globe flower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that resemble tiny globes. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for alpine environments. Its flowers are usually white, pink, or red, and they bloom in late summer to early autumn. Gypsophila globulosa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
