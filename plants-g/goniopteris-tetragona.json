    "intro": "Goniopteris tetragona, commonly known as the four-lobed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that are divided into four distinct lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Goniopteris tetragona plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
