It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it typically grows in coastal areas and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its long, slender, whip-like leaves that give it its common name. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. The tree is often used in traditional medicine and has cultural significance in the regions where it is found."
