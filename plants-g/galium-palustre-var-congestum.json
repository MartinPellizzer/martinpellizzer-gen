It features slender, ascending stems that often branch near the base, supporting clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. This plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
