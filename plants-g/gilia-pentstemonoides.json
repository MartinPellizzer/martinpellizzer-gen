    "intro": "Gilia pentstemonoides, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Gilia pentstemonoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
