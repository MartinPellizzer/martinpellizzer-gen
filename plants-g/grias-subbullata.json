    "intro": "Grias subbullata, commonly known as the bullate gloxinia, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Grias subbullata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
