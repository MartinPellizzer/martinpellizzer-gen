    "intro": "Grammadenia minor, commonly known as the dwarf grammadenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet and features dense, compact foliage. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual contrast. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Grammadenia minor is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and ornamental appeal."
