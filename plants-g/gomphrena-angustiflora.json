    "intro": "Gomphrena angustiflora, commonly known as narrowleaf gomphrena, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, feathery flower heads that range in color from pink to red and purple. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces bract-like flowers that are often mistaken for true flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Gomphrena angustiflora is also valued for its long-lasting blooms, which can persist through the fall season."
