    "intro": "Galactia crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with broad, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Galactia crassifolia has a deep root system that helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
