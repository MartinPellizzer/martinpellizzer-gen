    "intro": "Gonocaryum tarlacense, commonly known as the Tarlac cycad, is a unique plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
