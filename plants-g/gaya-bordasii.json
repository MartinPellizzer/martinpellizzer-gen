    "intro": "Gaya bordasii, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers and unique leaf structure, which are adaptations to its specific ecological niche. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in dense forest undergrowth. Its flowers bloom during the monsoon season, adding to its ecological significance in pollination networks. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
