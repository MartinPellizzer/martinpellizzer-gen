It features upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are palmately lobed with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This form is distinguished by its pale coloration compared to the typical variety of Geranium sibiricum."
