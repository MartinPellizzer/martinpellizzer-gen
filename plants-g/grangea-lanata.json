    "intro": "Grangea lanata, commonly known as the woolly grangea, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, or lanate, leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Grangea lanata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
