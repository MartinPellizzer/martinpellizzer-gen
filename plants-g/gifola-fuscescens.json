    "intro": "Gifola fuscescens, commonly known as the dark green fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
