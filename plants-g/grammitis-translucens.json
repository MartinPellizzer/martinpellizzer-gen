    "intro": "Grammitis translucens, commonly known as the translucent fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, translucent sheen. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis translucens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
