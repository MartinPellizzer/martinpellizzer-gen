It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a fine, whitish down on its stems and leaves, which gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or mountainous regions. Gnaphalium badillanum is also known for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
