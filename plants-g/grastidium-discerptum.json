    "intro": "Grastidium discerptum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its ability to absorb nutrients through its roots directly from the air and rain. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in swampy areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
