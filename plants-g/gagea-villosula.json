    "intro": "Gagea villosula, commonly known as the hairy gagea, is a small, bulbous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its bulbs are small and often covered in a layer of fine, hairy tissue, which gives it its common name. Gagea villosula is a short-lived perennial that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
