    "intro": "Gloxinia major, commonly known as the velvet leaf gloxinia, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in the evening. Gloxinia major thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
