    "intro": "Genosiris rudis, commonly known as the swamp iris, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with three petals and three sepals, typical of the Iridaceae family. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in marshy environments. Genosiris rudis is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is an important species in wetland ecosystems."
