It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its presence is often an indicator of undisturbed, nutrient-rich soils."
