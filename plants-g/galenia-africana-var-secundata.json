    "intro": "Galenia africana var. secundata, commonly known as the African galena, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching towards the top. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Galenia africana var. secundata is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
