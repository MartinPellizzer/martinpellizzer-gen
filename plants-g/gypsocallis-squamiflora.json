    "intro": "Gypsocallis squamiflora, commonly known as the velvetleaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
