    "intro": "Gyrinopsis acuminata, commonly known as the spiky sea lettuce, is a marine green alga found in coastal regions. It belongs to the family Ulvaceae and is characterized by its blade-like, ribbed thallus that can be green to brown in color. The plant typically grows in shallow, tide-pool environments and is often found attached to rocks or submerged structures. It plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for small marine organisms. Gyrinopsis acuminata is used in some traditional practices and is also studied for its potential in biotechnology applications."
