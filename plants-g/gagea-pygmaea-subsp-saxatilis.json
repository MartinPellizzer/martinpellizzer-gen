    "intro": "Gagea pygmaea subsp. saxatilis, commonly known as the saxatile gagea, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces clusters of delicate, grass-like leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
