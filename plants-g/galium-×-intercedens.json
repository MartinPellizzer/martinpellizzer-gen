    "intro": "Galium \u00d7 intercedens, commonly known as the hybrid wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Galium verum (common wood sorrel) and Galium aparine (cleavers), exhibiting traits from both parent species. The plant typically features slender, creeping stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in late spring to early summer. Galium \u00d7 intercedens is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and woodland edges."
