It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense cluster near the base. Its flowering stems can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, making it one of the tallest members of the Amaryllidaceae family. Gethyllis grandiflora is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its dramatic floral display."
