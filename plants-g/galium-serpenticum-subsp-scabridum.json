    "intro": "Galium serpenticum subsp. scabridum, commonly known as the rough bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to certain regions of North America. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, ascending stems that are covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Its small, white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters during the spring and early summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its overall appearance."
