    "intro": "Gymnanthes brasiliensis var. divaricata, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky fruit that resembles a star. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, while the flowers are small and clustered in cyathia. The fruit is edible when fully mature, though it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
