It typically forms dense mats with slender, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release seeds when mature. Galium mollugo subsp. erectum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
