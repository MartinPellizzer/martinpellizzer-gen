    "intro": "Gentianella anglica subsp. cornubiensis, commonly known as the Cornish gentian, is a flowering plant native to the south-western region of England. It is a member of the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and is often found in the moorlands of Cornwall and Devon. It is a perennial herb with lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers during the summer months. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species in the UK."
