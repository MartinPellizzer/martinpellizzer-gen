    "intro": "Goodenia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal goodenia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features erect, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense spikes and bloom during the spring and summer months. Goodenia littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
