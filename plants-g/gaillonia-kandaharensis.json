    "intro": "Gaillonia kandaharensis, commonly known as the Kandahar lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Afghanistan. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a contrasting dark center. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cool, arid climate to flourish. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species."
