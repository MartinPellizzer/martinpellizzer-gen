It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Gymnanthemum pectiniforme is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
