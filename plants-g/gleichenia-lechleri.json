    "intro": "Gleichenia lechleri, commonly known as the Andean maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of other ferns in the genus Gleichenia. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Gleichenia lechleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
