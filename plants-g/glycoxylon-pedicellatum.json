    "intro": "Glycoxylon pedicellatum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Glycoxylon pedicellatum is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which is used in traditional craftsmanship and furniture making. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
