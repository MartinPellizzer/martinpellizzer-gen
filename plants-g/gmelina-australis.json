    "intro": "Gmelina australis, commonly known as the Australian ironwood, is a tropical hardwood tree native to Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its dark, heavy, and durable wood, which is highly valued for its strength and resistance to decay. The tree has a straight trunk and can grow up to 30 meters tall, with smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and elliptical, with a leathery texture and a dark green upper surface. Gmelina australis produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, woody fruits containing a single seed."
