    "intro": "Galarhoeus verrucosus, commonly known as the rough-horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured leaves and its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its reproductive system relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption, which is a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
