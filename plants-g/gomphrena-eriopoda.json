    "intro": "Gomphrena eriopoda, commonly known as the woolly globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular inflorescences that range in color from pink to red, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Gomphrena eriopoda is also valued for its long-lasting blooms, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
