    "intro": "Gilia clokeyi, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Gilia clokeyi plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
