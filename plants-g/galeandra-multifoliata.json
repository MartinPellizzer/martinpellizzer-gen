    "intro": "Galeandra multifoliata, commonly known as the multileaf orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. The flowers, which can be pink, white, or yellow, are clustered in inflorescences and attract various pollinators."
