    "intro": "Grewia repanda, commonly known as the red gum tree, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
