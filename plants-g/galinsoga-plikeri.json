    "intro": "Galinsoga plikeri, commonly known as common gallinsonga, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces numerous seeds in small, capsule-like fruits, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions."
