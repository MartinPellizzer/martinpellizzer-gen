    "intro": "Gagea pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf gagea, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in partial to full shade. It produces a bulbous root system that helps it survive in its native environment, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Gagea pygmaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
