    "intro": "Gilia polycladon, commonly known as the red-flowered gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species characterized by its branched stems and clusters of small, showy flowers. The flowers are typically bright red or orange, with five petals and prominent stamens, making it a striking addition to wildflower displays. The plant thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in arid regions."
