It features a rosette of thick, waxy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
