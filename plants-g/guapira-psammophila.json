    "intro": "Guapira psammophila, commonly known as the sand-loving guapira, is a shrub native to the dry regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are adapted to withstand strong winds and temperature fluctuations. Guapira psammophila plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid habitats."
