    "intro": "Gilia arenaria var. davyi, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The species is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides."
