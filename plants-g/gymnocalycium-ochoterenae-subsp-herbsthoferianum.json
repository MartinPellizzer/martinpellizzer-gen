    "intro": "Gymnocalycium ochoterenae subsp. herbsthoferianum, commonly known as the Herbsthofer's moon cactus, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a spherical or slightly elongated stem covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but striking. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its hardiness and unique appearance."
