    "intro": "Goniopteris retroflexa, commonly known as the retroflex water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, pinnately divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Goniopteris retroflexa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms."
