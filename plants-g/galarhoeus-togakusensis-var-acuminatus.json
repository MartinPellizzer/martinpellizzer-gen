    "intro": "Galarhoeus togakusensis var. acuminatus, commonly known as the sharp-tipped galarhoeus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, typically blooming during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
