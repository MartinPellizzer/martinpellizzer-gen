    "intro": "Genoplesium vernale, commonly known as the early spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers with a distinctive spider-like appearance. Genoplesium vernale is a protected species due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
