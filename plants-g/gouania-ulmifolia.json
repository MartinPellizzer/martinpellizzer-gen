It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often elliptic or ovate leaves that resemble those of elm trees, giving it its common name. It produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in inflorescences. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks."
