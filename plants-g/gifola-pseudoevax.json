    "intro": "Gifola pseudoevax, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. This plant is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a star-like shape, blooming during the warmer months. It is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently."
