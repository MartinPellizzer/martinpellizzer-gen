    "intro": "Gymnocalycium gertii subsp. evelyniae, commonly known as the Evelyn's moon cactus, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rounded, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in a layer of white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
