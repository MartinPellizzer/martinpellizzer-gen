The plant is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and it is drought-tolerant once established. Its name \"sweet everlasting\" refers to its long-lasting flowers and the faintly sweet scent they emit."
