    "intro": "Glottidium vesicarium var. atrorubrum, commonly known as the red-black bladder nut, is a rare and distinctive member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, inflated, berry-like structures that resemble small bladders, which are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, while the stems are usually covered in fine, sticky hairs. The species is notable for its striking contrast in coloration between its green foliage and its deep red or black fruiting bodies."
