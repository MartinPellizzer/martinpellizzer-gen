    "intro": "Geissomeria bracteosa, commonly known as the bracted gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or orange when mature, though they are often too tart for direct consumption. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while the stems are often hairy. Geissomeria bracteosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife."
