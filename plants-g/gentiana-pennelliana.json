    "intro": "Gentiana pennelliana, commonly known as the Sierra Madre gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in high-elevation habitats, such as meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and the stems are often covered in fine hairs. Gentiana pennelliana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
