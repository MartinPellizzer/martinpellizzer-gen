    "intro": "Goniolimon tataricum subsp. graecum, commonly known as the Greek tatarian goniolimon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It has small, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to arid conditions and its role in local ecosystems."
