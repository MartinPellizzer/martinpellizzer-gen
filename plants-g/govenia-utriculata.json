    "intro": "Govenia utriculata, commonly known as the bladderfruit, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble bladders. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. The fruit, which splits open when mature, contains several small seeds enclosed in a fleshy, edible pulp."
