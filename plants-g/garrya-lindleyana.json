It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn a striking reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by bright red, elongated berries. Garrya lindleyana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
