    "intro": "Galium purpureum, commonly known as purple bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features opposite, oval-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, pinkish-white flowers clustered in loose racemes. Its stems are often reddish-purple, which gives the plant its common name. Galium purpureum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
