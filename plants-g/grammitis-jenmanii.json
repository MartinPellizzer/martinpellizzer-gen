    "intro": "Grammitis jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's spore moss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of spore-producing structures called sporangia. It is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Indonesia. Due to its unique morphology and ecological preferences, Grammitis jenmanii is of interest to botanists studying tropical flora."
