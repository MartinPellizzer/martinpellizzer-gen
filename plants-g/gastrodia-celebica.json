    "intro": "Gastrodia celebica, commonly known as the Celebes orchid or mountain orchid, is a rare and endangered plant native to the tropical forests of Indonesia and the Philippines. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. The plant produces a unique, fleshy, tuberous structure that stores nutrients and is often used in traditional medicine. Gastrodia celebica thrives in shaded, humid environments and is typically found at high elevations. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
