    "intro": "Gossypium tridens, commonly known as the three-toothed cotton, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other cotton species and plants like hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its cotton-like fibers are produced in the seed pods, which are typically covered in fine, fluffy hairs. Gossypium tridens is primarily of interest to botanists and researchers due to its unique morphology and potential genetic value."
