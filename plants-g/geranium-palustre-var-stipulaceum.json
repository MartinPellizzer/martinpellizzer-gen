    "intro": "Geranium palustre var. stipulaceum, commonly known as the marsh geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, upright stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along stream banks. Due to its adaptability to wet environments, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
