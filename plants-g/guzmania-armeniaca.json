    "intro": "Guzmania armeniaca, commonly known as the Armenian torch, is a striking bromeliad native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange bracts that resemble a torch, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces a tall flower spike that bears small, white, star-shaped flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Guzmania armeniaca is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
