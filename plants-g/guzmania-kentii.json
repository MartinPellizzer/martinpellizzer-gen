    "intro": "Guzmania kentii, commonly known as the silver torch plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that collect water in a central cup, which is used for nutrient absorption. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Guzmania kentii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
