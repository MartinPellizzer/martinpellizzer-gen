    "intro": "Gymnanthera paludosa, commonly known as the swamp gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in swampy or marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Gymnanthera paludosa has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
