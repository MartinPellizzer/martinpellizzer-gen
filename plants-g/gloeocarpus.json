    "intro": "Gloeocarpus, commonly known as the water chestnut, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, round, edible nuts that develop underwater. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it to the muddy bottom. Gloeocarpus thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshes and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
