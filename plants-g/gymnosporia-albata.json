    "intro": "Gymnosporia albata, commonly known as the white thorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces cone-like structures called gynoecia, which contain the seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Gymnosporia albata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
