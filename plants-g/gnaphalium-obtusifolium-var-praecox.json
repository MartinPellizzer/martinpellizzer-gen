    "intro": "Gnaphalium obtusifolium var. praecox, commonly known as early woollyweed, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on the stems and leaves, which gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like flower heads that are typically pale yellow to white in color. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. This variety is known for its early blooming period, typically in late spring to early summer."
