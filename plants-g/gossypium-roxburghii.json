    "intro": "Gossypium roxburghii, commonly known as wild cotton, is a species of flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its fluffy, white cotton-like fibers that develop around its seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, arid environments and is well adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a hairy surface, while its flowers are showy and typically pink or purple in color. The fibers of Gossypium roxburghii have been historically used for textile production, although it is less commonly cultivated compared to other cotton species."
