    "intro": "Glomeraria blitum, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a small flowering plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small, usually white or pale purple, and are arranged in a raceme. Glomeraria blitum is a carnivorous plant, relying on its specialized structures to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-deficient environments."
