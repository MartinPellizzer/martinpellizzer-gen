    "intro": "Galium vernum var. hirticaule, commonly known as hairy bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, often hairy stems that rise from a rhizomatous root system, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in umbels. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and covered with fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
