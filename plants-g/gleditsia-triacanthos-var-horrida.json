    "intro": "Gleditsia triacanthos var. horrida, commonly known as the thornless honey locust, is a deciduous legume native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are typically 12 to 20 inches long, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy and adaptable species for landscaping. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its roots also contributes to soil enrichment."
