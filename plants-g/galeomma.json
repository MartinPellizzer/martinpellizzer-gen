    "intro": "Galeomma, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are typically found in rocky or mountainous regions, where they thrive in well-drained soils. They are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors. Galeomma species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or tree trunks rather than in soil. Their botanical significance lies in their adaptability to harsh environments and their role in ecological systems."
