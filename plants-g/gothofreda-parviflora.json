    "intro": "Gothofreda parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and tiny, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
