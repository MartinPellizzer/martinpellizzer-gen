    "intro": "Gymnogramma \u00d7 kupperi, commonly known as the hybrid staghorn fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Gymnogramma acrostichoides and Gymnogramma sylvatica. It is a epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a compact, rosette-like structure with overlapping, leathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Gymnogramma \u00d7 kupperi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
