    "intro": "Grewia tristis, commonly known as the red sandalwood or white gum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually opposite and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
