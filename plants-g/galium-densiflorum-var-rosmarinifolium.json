    "intro": "Galium densiflorum var. rosmarinifolium, commonly known as rosemary leaf wood-sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive rosemary-like aroma, which is due to the presence of aromatic essential oils. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique and valuable species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
