    "intro": "Goniolimon strictum, commonly known as the rigid limony, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like growth habit and produces small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
