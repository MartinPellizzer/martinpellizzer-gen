    "intro": "Gomidesia tijucensis var. flexuosa, commonly known as the Tijuca flexuous plant, is a rare bromeliad native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure with narrow, waxy leaves that curve outward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow flowers, which are typically short-lived. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
