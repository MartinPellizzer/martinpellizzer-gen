    "intro": "Glechoma teucriifolia, commonly known as the creeping ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that help suppress weeds in gardens. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its aromatic leaves and flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental and medicinal purposes."
