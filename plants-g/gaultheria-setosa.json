    "intro": "Gaultheria setosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves that are narrow and leathery in texture. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, peppery flavor, often used in culinary applications. Gaultheria setosa is also valued for its aromatic leaves, which contain methyl salicylate, a compound used in traditional medicine."
