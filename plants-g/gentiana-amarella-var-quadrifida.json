    "intro": "Gentiana amarella var. quadrifida, commonly known as the four-leaf gentian, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its deep blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variant is distinguished by its unique quadrifid (four-lobed) corolla, which sets it apart from other gentian species."
