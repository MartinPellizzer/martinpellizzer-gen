    "intro": "Gaultheria reticulata, commonly known as the red evergreen or red mountain laurel, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for birds and small mammals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. Gaultheria reticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
