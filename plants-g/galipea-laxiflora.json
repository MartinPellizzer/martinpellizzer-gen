    "intro": "Galipea laxiflora, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a legume containing several seeds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
