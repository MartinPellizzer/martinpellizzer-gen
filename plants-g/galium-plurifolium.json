    "intro": "Galium plurifolium, commonly known as creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium plurifolium is noted for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
