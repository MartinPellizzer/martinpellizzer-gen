    "intro": "Gyrostachys lindleyana, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in desert ecosystems."
