    "intro": "Geniostoma nigrescens, commonly known as the black-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It has small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides nectar to attract pollinators such as bees and wasps. Its berries are usually red or black and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Geniostoma nigrescens is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
