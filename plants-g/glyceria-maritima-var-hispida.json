    "intro": "Glyceria maritima var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal and wetland areas. It is characterized by its erect, cylindrical stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in saline or brackish environments, such as mudflats and salt marshes, where it tolerates high salinity and periodic flooding. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its common name. This variety is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing sediment in intertidal zones."
