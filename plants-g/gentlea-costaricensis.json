    "intro": "Gentlea costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican gentian, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
