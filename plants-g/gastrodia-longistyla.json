    "intro": "Gastrodia longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled gastrodia, is a rare and ancient orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and its unique morphology, which includes a single, fleshy, club-like stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a dense spike, and it lacks true leaves, relying instead on its rhizomes for photosynthesis. Gastrodia longistyla is notable for its medicinal properties and is often sought after in traditional Chinese medicine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
