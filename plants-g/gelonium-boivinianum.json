    "intro": "Gelonium boivinianum, commonly known as the Boivin's gelonium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring elliptical leaves with a glossy, dark green surface and prominent veins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming during the wet season. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gelonium boivinianum is considered a conservation concern."
