    "intro": "Gymnadenia souliei, commonly known as the Souchong orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Gymnadenia souliei has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
