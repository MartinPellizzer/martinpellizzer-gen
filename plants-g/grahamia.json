    "intro": "Grahamia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its delicate, white, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Grahamia lacks true leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are often found on trees or other substrates. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
