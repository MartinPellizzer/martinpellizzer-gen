    "intro": "Geonoma andicola, commonly known as the Andean fern, is a species of fern native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Geonoma andicola plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
