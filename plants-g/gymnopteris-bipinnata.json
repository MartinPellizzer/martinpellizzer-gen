    "intro": "Gymnopteris bipinnata, commonly known as the bipinnate huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Gymnopteris bipinnata is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental foliage."
