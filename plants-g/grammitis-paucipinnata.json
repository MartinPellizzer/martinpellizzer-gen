    "intro": "Grammitis paucipinnata, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis paucipinnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
