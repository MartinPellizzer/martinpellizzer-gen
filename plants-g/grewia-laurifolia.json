It features small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in spring, resembling snowballs, hence its common name. The plant has simple, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have a slight waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Grewia laurifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
