    "intro": "Glossorhyncha nana, commonly known as the dwarf glover's tongue, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it a common sight in swampy areas. Due to its delicate nature, it is often overlooked but plays a role in local ecosystems."
