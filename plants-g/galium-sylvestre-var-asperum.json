    "intro": "Galium sylvestre var. asperum, commonly known as rough wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, ascending stems that are covered in stiff, bristly hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a waxy surface and may have a slightly sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks."
