It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for garden use in Mediterranean climates."
