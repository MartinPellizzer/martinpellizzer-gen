    "intro": "Gardneria shimadae, commonly known as the Shimada hibiscus, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Okinawa in Japan. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, pink to red flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with broad, waxy leaves that are dark green in color. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gardneria shimadae is considered a vulnerable species."
