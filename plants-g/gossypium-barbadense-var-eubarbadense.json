It is characterized by its long, fine fibers that are highly valued for their strength and softness. The plant is an annual herbaceous species that produces fluffy, white cotton bolls containing the fibrous seed hairs. It thrives in warm, tropical climates with well-drained soils and requires a long growing season. Due to its superior fiber quality, it is often used in high-end textile production."
