    "intro": "Galega genistoides, commonly known as the creeping goat's rue, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, hairy pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant or used in ecological restoration projects."
