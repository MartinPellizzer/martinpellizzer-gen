    "intro": "Galophthalmum, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. They produce small, often white or pale flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The fruits are usually berries that contain toxic compounds, making them unsuitable for human consumption."
