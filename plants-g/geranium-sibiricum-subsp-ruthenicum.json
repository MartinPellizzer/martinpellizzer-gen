It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
