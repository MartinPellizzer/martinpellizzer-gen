    "intro": "Gerardia tenuifolia, commonly known as slenderleaf gerardia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypselae. Gerardia tenuifolia is often used in native plant gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
