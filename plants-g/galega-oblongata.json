    "intro": "Galega oblongata, commonly known as horse bean, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that are followed by pods containing several large, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, disturbed areas. Galega oblongata is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and has been used historically in agriculture and traditional medicine."
