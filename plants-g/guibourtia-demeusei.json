It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its durable, heavy wood with a fine grain. The plant has compound leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its valuable timber, it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
