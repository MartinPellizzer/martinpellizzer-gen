    "intro": "Galium trifidum var. tinctorium, commonly known as the redroot sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and trifid (three-lobed) leaves, which are often hairy. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and coastal areas. Its historical use in dyeing fabrics with its roots has contributed to its common name."
