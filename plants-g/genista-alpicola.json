    "intro": "Genista alpicola, commonly known as the alpine genista, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and distinctive pod-like fruits. This species is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in harsh, alpine conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by elongated seed pods. Its hardy nature and ability to colonize poor soils make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
