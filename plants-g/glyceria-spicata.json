    "intro": "Glyceria spicata, commonly known as spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands that help stabilize shoreline areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats. Glyceria spicata plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
