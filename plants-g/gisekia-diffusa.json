    "intro": "Gisekia diffusa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Gisekia diffusa is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
