It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
