    "intro": "Griffithia siamensis, commonly known as the Siam Griffithia, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gnetaceae, which includes gymnosperms, and is characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often deciduous. Its reproductive structures, including cones, are simple and consist of a single ovule, reflecting its primitive evolutionary traits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Griffithia siamensis is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
