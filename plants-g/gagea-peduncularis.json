    "intro": "Gagea peduncularis, commonly known as the clustered gagea, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in woodland habitats and thrives in partial shade with well-drained soil. Its leaves are grass-like, forming a rosette at the base, and it produces bulbous underground structures for storage and propagation. Gagea peduncularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in native plant gardens."
