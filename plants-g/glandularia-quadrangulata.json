    "intro": "Glandularia quadrangulata, commonly known as the four-angle verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has glandular hairs on its leaves and stems, which secrete oils and contribute to its aromatic properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in arid and semi-arid regions. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
