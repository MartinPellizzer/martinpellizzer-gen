    "intro": "Grewia pinnatifida, commonly known as the sour fig or wild sour plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into round, fleshy fruits with a tart flavor. The fruits are often consumed raw or used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
