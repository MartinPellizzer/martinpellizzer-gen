It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale purple, which bloom in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and has been traditionally used in local herbal medicine. Germanea australis thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens."
