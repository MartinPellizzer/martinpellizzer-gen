    "intro": "Grewia mollis var. petitiana, commonly known as the dwarf yellow globemallow, is a small shrub native to southern Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often used in coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance. The fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds."
