    "intro": "Garcinia hygrophila, commonly known as the water apple or mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The tree's fruit, which is typically round and has a thick, red or purple rind, contains a white, segmented, edible flesh. Garcinia hygrophila thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and economically valuable in traditional and modern contexts."
