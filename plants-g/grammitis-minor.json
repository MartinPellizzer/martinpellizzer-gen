    "intro": "Grammitis minor, commonly known as the small grammitis, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Grammitis minor plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to canopy microhabitats and providing shelter for small invertebrates."
