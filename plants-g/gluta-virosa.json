    "intro": "Gluta virosa, commonly known as the wild coffee tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many coffee species, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by small, red, fleshy berries containing a single seed. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported health benefits. Gluta virosa is also notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in local ecosystems."
