It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically bright green, with a distinctive pattern of veins that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
