    "intro": "Gaultheria serrulata, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, edible berries that resemble strawberries in both color and taste. These berries are rich in antioxidants and have been used traditionally in herbal remedies. Gaultheria serrulata thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
