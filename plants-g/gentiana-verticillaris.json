It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces multiple flowering stems that rise above the foliage. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundras. The genus Gentiana is known for its showy, often blue or purple flowers, which are adapted for pollination by insects such as bees and butterflies."
