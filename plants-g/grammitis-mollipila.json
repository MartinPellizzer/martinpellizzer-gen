    "intro": "Grammitis mollipila, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, soft, and velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, forming dense, low-lying mats. Its leaves are usually dark green and covered in a fine, silky layer of hairs. Grammitis mollipila is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
