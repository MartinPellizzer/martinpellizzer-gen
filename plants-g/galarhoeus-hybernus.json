    "intro": "Galarhoeus hybernus, commonly known as the winter's breath, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Pyrenees. It is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has a short, rhizomatous root system and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
