    "intro": "Gundelia aragatsi subsp. aragatsi, commonly known as Armenian milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the highlands of Armenia. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, alpine climate of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
