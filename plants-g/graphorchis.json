    "intro": "Graphorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique growth habit, featuring a slender, leafless stem and a single, showy flower that blooms in late summer. The plant is characterized by its pale green to white petals and sepals, which give it a ghostly appearance. Graphorchis thrives in acidic, moist soils and is often found in shaded, pine forest habitats. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
