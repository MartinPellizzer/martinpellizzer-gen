It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are often less than 1 cm in width. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, forming dense, mat-like colonies. Its fronds are usually lanceolate or linear, with a leathery texture and a dark green color. Grammitis limapes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
