    "intro": "Gymnocalycium borthii subsp. nogolense, commonly known as the Nogolense moon cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Argentina. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its globular, spiny stems that store water. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green or blue-green stems. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience in dry conditions."
