    "intro": "Gaya ribifolia, commonly known as the redwood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and it reproduces via sexual reproduction through the formation of sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Gaya ribifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
