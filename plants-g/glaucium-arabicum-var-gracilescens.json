    "intro": "Glaucium arabicum var. gracilescens, commonly known as the slender goat's beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in a bluish-gray waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense, branched inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, with a distinct basal rosette structure. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
