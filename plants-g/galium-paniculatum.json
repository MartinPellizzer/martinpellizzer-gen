    "intro": "Galium paniculatum, commonly known as silverweed or white sweet clover, is a flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and has been introduced to other regions. The plant features slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in paniculate inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, simple, and often covered with fine, silvery hairs, giving the plant its common name."
