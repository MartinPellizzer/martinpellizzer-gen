    "intro": "Gastrochilus blumei, commonly known as the Blume's stomach orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a sympodial growth habit, characterized by its creeping rhizomes and clustered pseudobulbs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Gastrochilus blumei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
