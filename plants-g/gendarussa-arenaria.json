    "intro": "Gendarussa arenaria, commonly known as the sand lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, reducing water loss through transpiration. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
