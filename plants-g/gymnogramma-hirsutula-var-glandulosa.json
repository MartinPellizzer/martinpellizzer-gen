    "intro": "Gymnogramma hirsutula var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular hirsute gymnogramma, is a variant of the gymnogramma genus within the Pteridaceae family. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that often have a velvety texture. The fronds are typically arching and can be found in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is distinguished by the presence of glandular structures on its leaf surfaces, which may play a role in water retention or defense against herbivores. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
