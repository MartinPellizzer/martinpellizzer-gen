    "intro": "Glyceria maritima var. nana, commonly known as dwarf saltgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in estuaries and tidal flats. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and fluctuating water levels. Its compact growth habit makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
