    "intro": "Goniopteris resiliens, commonly known as the resilient shield fern, is a species of fern characterized by its large, robust fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping rhizomes that help it spread across forest floors. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, shield-like appearance that gives it its common name. Goniopteris resiliens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
