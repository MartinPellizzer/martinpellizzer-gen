    "intro": "Galinsoga quadriradiata f. vargasiana, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its rapid spread in disturbed soils. It is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in other open, sunny habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural areas."
