    "intro": "Glyceria intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, elongated leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize the shoreline. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered inflorescences, which are usually greenish or reddish in color. Glyceria intermedia plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
