    "intro": "Galium bracteolatum, commonly known as the bracteolate bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in the spring, followed by small, bladder-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its presence is often an indicator of undisturbed, nutrient-rich soils."
