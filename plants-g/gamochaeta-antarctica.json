It is a small, herbaceous annual plant that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, white to pale blue flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Gamochaeta antarctica is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
