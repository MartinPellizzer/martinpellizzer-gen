    "intro": "Gerardia lanceolata var. rigida, commonly known as rigid lance-leaf gerardia, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or swampy areas. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are rigid and often have a waxy coating. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to wetland environments, with a fibrous root system and compact growth habit."
