    "intro": "Gypsophila nana var. glabrifolia, commonly known as the cushion gypsophila, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, forming small, rounded mounds of foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its drought tolerance and cold hardiness."
