It is a small shrub characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to its specific ecological niche and its role in local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
