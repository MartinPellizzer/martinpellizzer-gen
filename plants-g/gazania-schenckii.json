    "intro": "Gazania schenckii, commonly known as the Cape gold or yellow gazania, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow or orange flowers that resemble daisies. The plant features succulent leaves that are often hairy and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Gazania schenckii typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its flowering period usually occurs in late winter to early spring, adding a splash of color to gardens during cooler months."
