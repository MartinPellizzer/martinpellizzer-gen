    "intro": "Gagea caelestis, commonly known as the blue gagea, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in California and Oregon. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are grass-like and form a basal rosette, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Gagea caelestis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
