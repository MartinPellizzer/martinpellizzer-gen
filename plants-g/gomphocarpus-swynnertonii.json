    "intro": "Gomphocarpus swynnertonii, commonly known as the Swynnerton's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, orange-yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain the seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores."
