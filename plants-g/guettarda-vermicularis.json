    "intro": "Guettarda vermicularis, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green foliage and clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round, green fruits that turn red when mature, containing seeds enclosed in a fleshy pulp. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Guettarda vermicularis is also valued for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and partial shade."
