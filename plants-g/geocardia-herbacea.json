    "intro": "Geocardia herbacea, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that store water and nutrients, adapting to nutrient-poor soils. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale in color. Geocardia herbacea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic organisms."
