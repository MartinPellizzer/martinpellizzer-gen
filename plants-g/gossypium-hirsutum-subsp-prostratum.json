    "intro": "Gossypium hirsutum subsp. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate cotton, is a subspecies of upland cotton characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces fluffy, white fibers encasing its seeds, which are used in textile production. Its prostrate growth form allows it to spread across the ground, making it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions. This subspecies is less commonly cultivated than other cotton varieties but remains an important wild relative in genetic research."
