    "intro": "Gentlea propinqua, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in wet, swampy habitats and relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Its unique morphology and ecological requirements make it a subject of interest in botanical research. Due to habitat loss and conservation challenges, it is listed as endangered in many regions."
