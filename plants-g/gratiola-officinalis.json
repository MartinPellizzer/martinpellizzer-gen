    "intro": "Gratiola officinalis, commonly known as yellow pimpernel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate on the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a slightly rough texture, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils. Gratiola officinalis has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
