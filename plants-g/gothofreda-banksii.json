    "intro": "Gothofreda banksii, commonly known as the Banks' ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical features include long, slender roots and a single, narrow stem that supports its striking, showy blooms. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Gothofreda banksii is considered a conservation concern and is protected in its native range."
