It features small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring, typically in shades of yellow and white. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its compact appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate flowers and drought tolerance."
