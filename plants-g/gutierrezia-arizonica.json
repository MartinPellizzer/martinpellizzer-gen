    "intro": "Gutierrezia arizonica, commonly known as Arizona greasewood, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Gutierrezia arizonica plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
