It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage.
