It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically grey-green in colour, with a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces striking red or orange cylindrical flowers that bloom in summer, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
