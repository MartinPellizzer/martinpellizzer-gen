    "intro": "Geonoma macrostachys var. acaulis, commonly known as the stemless bamboo palm, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its tall, slender, unbranched stems that resemble bamboo. It is native to the humid lowland forests of Central and South America, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant features large, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their aesthetic appeal. Its growth habit is clump-forming, with each stem producing a single, elongated inflorescence that bears small, clustered flowers. The variety acaulis is distinguished by its lack of a stem base, giving it a more compact and elegant appearance compared to other varieties."
