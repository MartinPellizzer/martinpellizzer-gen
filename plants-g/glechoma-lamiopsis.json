    "intro": "Glechoma lamiopsis, commonly known as the creeping ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers. It spreads rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that can suppress other vegetation. Glechoma lamiopsis is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and along stream banks."
