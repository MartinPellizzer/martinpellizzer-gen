    "intro": "Gelseminum stans, commonly known as the yellow moon vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers and dark green, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially hazardous to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Its ornamental value is sometimes offset by its poisonous nature."
