It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered with fine hairs. Galium ophiolithicum is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions."
