    "intro": "Grammitis vernicosa, commonly known as the glossy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically covered in a waxy, glossy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitats. The plant's rhizomes are often thick and creeping, allowing it to anchor itself to trees or rocks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Grammitis vernicosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
