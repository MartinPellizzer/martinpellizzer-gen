    "intro": "Genista patens, commonly known as the spreading broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features slender, wiry stems that often spread along the ground, forming dense mats. Its small, yellow flowers appear in spring, followed by elongated seed pods that mature in late summer. Genista patens is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils."
