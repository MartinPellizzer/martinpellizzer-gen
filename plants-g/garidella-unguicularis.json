It is characterized by its specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its flowers are small and bilaterally symmetrical. Garidella unguicularis is a carnivorous plant, showcasing unique adaptations for survival in nutrient-poor aquatic habitats."
