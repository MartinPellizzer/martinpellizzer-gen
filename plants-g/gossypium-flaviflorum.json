It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its yellow flowers and fluffy cotton-like seeds. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers are borne in clusters at the leaf axils. The cotton fibers produced by this plant are similar to those of other cotton species and have been used in traditional textile applications."
