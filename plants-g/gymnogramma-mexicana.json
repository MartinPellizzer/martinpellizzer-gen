    "intro": "Gymnogramma mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican rock fern, is a species of fern native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Gymnogramma mexicana has lance-shaped pinnae with serrated edges, and its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific moisture and light requirements."
