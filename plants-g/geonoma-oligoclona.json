    "intro": "Geonoma oligoclona, commonly known as the slender-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Geonoma oligoclona is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
