    "intro": "Glycine maclurei, commonly known as Maclure's soybean, is a climbing legume native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that are typical of the legume family. The plant produces pods that contain several round, edible seeds, similar to other soybean species. It is often found in moist, wooded areas and can thrive in partial shade. Glycine maclurei is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility in agricultural settings."
