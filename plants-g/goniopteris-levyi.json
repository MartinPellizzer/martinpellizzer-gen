    "intro": "Goniopteris levyi, commonly known as the Levii's kidney fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive kidney-shaped outline. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common reproductive feature in ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
