    "intro": "Glyceria distans var. miliacea, commonly known as the slender false sweetflag, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
