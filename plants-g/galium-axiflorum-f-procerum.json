    "intro": "Galium axiflorum f. procerum, commonly known as the tall bedstraw, is a variant of the bedstraw genus characterized by its elongated stems and smaller, clustered flowers. It is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence is usually a dense cluster of flowers at the tip of the stem, and it is known for its delicate, creeping growth habit. This form is distinguished from the typical species by its more upright and taller stature."
