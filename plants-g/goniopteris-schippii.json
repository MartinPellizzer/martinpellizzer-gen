    "intro": "Goniopteris schippii, commonly known as the Schippi's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Goniopteris schippii plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
