It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters. Its unique feature is the bifid (split) leaves, which distinguish it from other species in the genus. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
