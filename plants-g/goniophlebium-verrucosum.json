    "intro": "Goniophlebium verrucosum, commonly known as the woolly liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thallus that is covered in a layer of fine, woolly structures, giving it its common name. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its structure includes both leaf-like and stem-like organs. Goniophlebium verrucosum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
