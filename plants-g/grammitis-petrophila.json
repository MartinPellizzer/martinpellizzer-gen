    "intro": "Grammitis petrophila, commonly known as the rock grammitis, is a rare epiphytic fern native to New Zealand. It thrives in humid, shaded environments on rock faces and tree trunks. The plant has slender, wiry fronds with small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It is characterized by its delicate appearance and ability to grow in nutrient-poor substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
