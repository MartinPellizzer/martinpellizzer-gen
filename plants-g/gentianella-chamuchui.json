It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in dry, harsh environments. Its short stature and clustered inflorescence make it a distinctive member of the gentian family. Despite its beauty, it is relatively rare and requires specific conditions to thrive."
