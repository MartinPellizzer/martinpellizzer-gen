    "intro": "Gilia multicaulis subsp. peduncularis, commonly known as the slender gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across open landscapes. The species is part of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and exhibits typical traits of the genus Gilia, including showy, tubular flowers."
