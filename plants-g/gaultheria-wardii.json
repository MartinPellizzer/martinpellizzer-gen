    "intro": "Gaultheria wardii, commonly known as the Ward's wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by bright red berries that are edible but have a strong, minty flavor. Gaultheria wardii thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests and rocky slopes. Its aromatic leaves and berries have been used traditionally for their medicinal and culinary properties."
