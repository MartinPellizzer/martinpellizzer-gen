    "intro": "Geophila reniformis var. asiatica, commonly known as the Asian kidneyweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features delicate, kidney-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in its native habitat."
