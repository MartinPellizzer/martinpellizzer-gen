    "intro": "Gonystylus borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. This species is also notable for its slow growth rate and long lifespan, making it a significant component of Borneo's rainforest ecosystems."
