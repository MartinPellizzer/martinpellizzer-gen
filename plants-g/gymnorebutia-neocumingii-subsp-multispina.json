It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and desert landscapes."
