    "intro": "Geophila macropoda, commonly known as the large-leaved wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, delicate white or pale yellow flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Geophila macropoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
