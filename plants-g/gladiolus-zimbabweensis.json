    "intro": "Gladiolus zimbabweensis, commonly known as the Zimbabwean gladiolus, is a striking herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically produces spike-like inflorescences with numerous petals that can range in color from white to deep red. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens in suitable climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for its beauty, though it remains relatively less common in horticulture compared to other gladiolus species."
