    "intro": "Galeopsis verlotii, commonly known as the French hogweed, is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils. The plant features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are small, clustered in whorled inflorescences. It produces small, black, ovoid fruits that are dispersed by wind. Galeopsis verlotii is native to Europe and western Asia but has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive in certain habitats."
