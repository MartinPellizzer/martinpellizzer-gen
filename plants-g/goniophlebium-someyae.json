    "intro": "Goniophlebium someyae, commonly known as the Japanese rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, often hairy fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, which are usually divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments."
