    "intro": "Garcinia crassiflora, commonly known as the African mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and Eastern Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The tree's fruit, which is typically round and covered in a thick, reddish-purple rind, is edible and has a tart, citrus-like flavor. Garcinia crassiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its growth habit makes it suitable for cultivation in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil."
