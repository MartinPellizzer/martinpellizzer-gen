    "intro": "Gorgonidium bulbostylum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it an invasive species in many areas."
