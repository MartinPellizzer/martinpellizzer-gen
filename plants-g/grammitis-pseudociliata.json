    "intro": "Grammitis pseudociliata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Grammitis pseudociliata plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
