    "intro": "Gomphocarpus fruticosus f. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap contains latex, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. This species is particularly important as a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other native insects."
