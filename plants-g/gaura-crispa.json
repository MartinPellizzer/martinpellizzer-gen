    "intro": "Gaura crispa, commonly known as the crisped gaura, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and showy, pink to white flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet and prefers full sun to partial shade. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Gaura crispa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
