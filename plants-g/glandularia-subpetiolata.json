It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that secrete oils, which can deter herbivores and contribute to its medicinal properties. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its small blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
