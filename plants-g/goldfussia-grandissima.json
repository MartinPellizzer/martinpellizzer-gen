    "intro": "Goldfussia grandissima, commonly known as the giant goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Goldfussia grandissima is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands."
