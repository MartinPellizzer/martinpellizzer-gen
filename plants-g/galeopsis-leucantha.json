    "intro": "Galeopsis leucantha, commonly known as white hedge-nettle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, pale blue to white flowers arranged in whorled clusters. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
