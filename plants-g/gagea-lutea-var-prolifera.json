    "intro": "Gagea lutea var. prolifera, commonly known as the yellow star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant's bulbs are typically clustered and can multiply through vegetative propagation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a native wildflower and its ecological value to pollinators."
