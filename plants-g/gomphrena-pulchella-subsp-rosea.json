    "intro": "Gomphrena pulchella subsp. rosea, commonly known as the rose globe thistle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globe-shaped inflorescences that range in color from pink to deep rose. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
