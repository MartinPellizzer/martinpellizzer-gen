    "intro": "Gagea grey-wilsonii, commonly known as the Wilson's gagea, is a rare and small perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clustered, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing white or pale pink petals that are often tinged with green. Gagea grey-wilsonii is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
