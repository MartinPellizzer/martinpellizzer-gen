    "intro": "Geophila obvallata subsp. involucrata, commonly known as the woolly ground-ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and produces small, white to pale blue flowers clustered in umbels. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with hairy surfaces that give the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, woolly foliage and its ability to form dense mats, making it an important component of its native ecosystems."
