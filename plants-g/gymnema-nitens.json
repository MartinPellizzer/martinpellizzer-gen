    "intro": "Gymnema nitens, commonly known as the Indian nettle or gymnema, is a climbing shrub native to the forests of India and Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for its unique ability to inhibit the taste of sweetness, a property attributed to the presence of gymnemic acids. Gymnema nitens is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional Ayurvedic medicine. Its roots and leaves are often used to manage diabetes due to their hypoglycemic effects."
