    "intro": "Glyceria pulchella, commonly known as the slender glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands that contribute to wetland vegetation structure. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms. Glyceria pulchella is also valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland restoration projects."
