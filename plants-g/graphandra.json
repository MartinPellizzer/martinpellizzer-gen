It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling stars, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an herb or shrub, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Graphandra thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements."
