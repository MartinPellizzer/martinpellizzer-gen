    "intro": "Gymnocarpium, commonly known as the naked-seed plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The fruits of Gymnocarpium are dry and indehiscent, containing a single seed, which is a key botanical feature. These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. They are valued for their ecological role in supporting local wildlife and their ornamental appeal in gardens."
