    "intro": "Gaura odorata, commonly known as sweet gaura, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pink to white, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. It is often used as a border plant or in mixed flower beds due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements. Gaura odorata is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
