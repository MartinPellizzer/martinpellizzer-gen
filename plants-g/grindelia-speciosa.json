    "intro": "Grindelia speciosa, commonly known as the desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. Grindelia speciosa is also noted for its ability to produce a milky sap that can cause skin irritation."
