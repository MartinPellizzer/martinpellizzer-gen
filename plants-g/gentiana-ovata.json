    "intro": "Gentiana ovata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gentian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are usually unbranched. Gentiana ovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
