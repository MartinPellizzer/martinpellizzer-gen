    "intro": "Gymnopteris donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds with a distinctive holly-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Gymnopteris donnell-smithii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
