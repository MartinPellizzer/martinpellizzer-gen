    "intro": "Gaultheria acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to the temperate regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with small, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. It produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans and birds. Gaultheria acuminata is also valued for its aromatic leaves, which contain methyl salicylate, a compound used in traditional medicine."
