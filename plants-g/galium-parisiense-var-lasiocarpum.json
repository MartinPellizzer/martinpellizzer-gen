    "intro": "Galium parisiense var. lasiocarpum, commonly known as the silky bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered with fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name. Its stems are slender and often sprawling, and the fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
