    "intro": "Glycosmis cyanocarpa var. cyanocarpa, commonly known as the blue-fruited mohavea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces berries that start off green and mature to a striking blue-black color, which are edible but have a tart, acidic flavor. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along desert margins. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
