    "intro": "Gastroglottis, commonly known as the \"cancer weed,\" is a flowering plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, succulent stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Gastroglottis is native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, and it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
