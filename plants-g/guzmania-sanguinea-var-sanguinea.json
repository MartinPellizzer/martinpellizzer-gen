    "intro": "Guzmania sanguinea var. sanguinea, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround the central flower spike, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant features a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Guzmania sanguinea var. sanguinea is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
