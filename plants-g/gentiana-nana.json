    "intro": "Gentiana nana, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of broad, waxy, dark green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are often surrounded by white or pale blue bracts. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Gentiana nana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
