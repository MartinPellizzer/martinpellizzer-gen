    "intro": "Gossypium racemosum, commonly known as the wild cotton or racemose cotton, is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds encased in a boll, similar to other cotton species. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest in cotton breeding programs for improving fiber quality and disease resistance."
