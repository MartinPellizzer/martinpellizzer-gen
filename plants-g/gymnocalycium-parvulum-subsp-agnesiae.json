    "intro": "Gymnocalycium parvulum subsp. agnesiae, commonly known as the Agnesia's moon cactus, is a compact cactus native to southern South America. It features a swollen, globular stem with a short, cylindrical caudex, and it produces small, white flowers during the growing season. The plant is characterized by its dense, spiny areoles and is often cultivated for its ornamental appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. This subspecies is closely related to other Gymnocalycium species and is valued for its unique morphology and hardy nature."
