    "intro": "Geum pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean avens, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually unbranched and hairy. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense cymes, and are typically pink or reddish in color. Geum pyrenaicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
