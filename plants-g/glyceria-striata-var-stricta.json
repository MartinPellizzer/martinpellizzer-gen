    "intro": "Glyceria striata var. stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often upright, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are mostly hairless. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
