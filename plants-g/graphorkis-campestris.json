It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stems. Graphorkis campestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
