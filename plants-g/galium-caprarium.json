    "intro": "Galium caprarium, commonly known as sticky willow or goat's milk, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers clustered in umbels, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Galium caprarium is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
