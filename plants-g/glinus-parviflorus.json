It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the dry season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
