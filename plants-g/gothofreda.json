    "intro": "Gothofreda, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its unique, pale green or white, delicate flowers that resemble the shape of a ghostly figure. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Gothofreda has small, fleshy leaves that help it store water in its natural, often humid habitat. Due to its rarity and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
