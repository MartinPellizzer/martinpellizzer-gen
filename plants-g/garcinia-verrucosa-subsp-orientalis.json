It is characterized by its elongated, yellowish-tinged leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces oblong, woody fruits that contain a single large seed, surrounded by a yellow, acidic pulp. The fruit is often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent due to its tart taste. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and culinary contexts."
