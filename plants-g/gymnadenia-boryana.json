    "intro": "Gymnadenia boryana, commonly known as the Bory's grass pink, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Gymnadenia boryana has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
