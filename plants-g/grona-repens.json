    "intro": "Grona repens, commonly known as the creeping gronan, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with rhizomatous stems that spread across the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Grona repens is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
