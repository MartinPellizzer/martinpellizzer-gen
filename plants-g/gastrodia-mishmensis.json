    "intro": "Gastrodia mishmensis, commonly known as the Yunnan ghost tuber, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces a single, thick, tuberous root that stores energy and is often mistaken for a fungus due to its appearance. It blooms with small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a spike. Due to its unique biology and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and faces significant conservation challenges."
