It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is often found in dry, rocky soils. Its foliage and flowers are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.
