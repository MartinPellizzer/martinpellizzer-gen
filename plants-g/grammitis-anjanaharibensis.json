    "intro": "Grammitis anjanaharibensis, commonly known as the Madagascar fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and organic-rich soil to flourish. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying biodiversity in Madagascar. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected natural reserves."
