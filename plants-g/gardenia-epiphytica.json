    "intro": "Gardenia epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic gardenia, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in summer. This plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its glossy foliage and showy blooms make it a popular ornamental plant in humid climates. However, it requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive."
