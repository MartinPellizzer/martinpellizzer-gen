    "intro": "Galium orientale var. latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf woodcrushers, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are usually broader than those of the typical *Galium orientale*, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides."
