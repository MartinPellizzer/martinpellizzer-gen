    "intro": "Glechoma concolor, commonly known as the broad-leaved ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly waxy texture and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by dark blue or purple berries. Its creeping growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can suppress other vegetation. Glechoma concolor is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
