It features compact, bushy stems with small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red and purple. The foliage is typically narrow and grass-like, with the plant producing fluffy, plume-like bracts that give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
