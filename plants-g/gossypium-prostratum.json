    "intro": "Gossypium prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate cotton or creeping cotton, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit, with small, pale green leaves and pale pink to white flowers. Native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, it thrives in warm, dry climates. The plant produces fluffy, white fibers that are similar to those of other cotton species, though it is less commercially valuable. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and genetic studies."
