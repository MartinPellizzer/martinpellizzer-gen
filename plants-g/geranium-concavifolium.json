It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to violet. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a distinctive concave base, giving the plant its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate blooms."
