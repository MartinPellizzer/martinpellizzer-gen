    "intro": "Gnaphalium endeavourense, commonly known as the New Zealand everlasting, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a fine, white to pale yellow pollen that is easily dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Gnaphalium endeavourense is also noted for its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion."
