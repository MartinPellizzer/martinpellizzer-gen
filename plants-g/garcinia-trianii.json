    "intro": "Garcinia trianii, commonly known as the Malabar tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, round, orange-red fruits that are rich in tannins. The fruit's pulp is edible and has a sour taste, while the seeds are used in traditional medicine. Garcinia trianii is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
