    "intro": "Galium aparine proles spurium, commonly known as cleavers, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that are covered in fine, hooked hairs, which aid in its clinging to surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and have a serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Cleavers are often found in moist, disturbed soils and are known for their medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
