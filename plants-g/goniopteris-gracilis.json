    "intro": "Goniopteris gracilis, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a fern species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as cliffs, rock faces, and forest floors. Its rhizome is wiry and often covered in a thin layer of soil or moss. Goniopteris gracilis plays a role in stabilizing rocky substrates and providing microhabitats for small organisms."
