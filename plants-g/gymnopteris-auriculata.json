    "intro": "Gymnopteris auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes on the fronds, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Gymnopteris auriculata is native to parts of Asia and is often found in temperate climates."
