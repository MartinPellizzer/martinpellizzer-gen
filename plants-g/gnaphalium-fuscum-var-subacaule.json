It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowering period usually occurs in the spring and early summer, and it is valued for its ornamental appearance and resilience.
