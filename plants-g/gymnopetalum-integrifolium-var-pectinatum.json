    "intro": "Gymnopetalum integrifolium var. pectinatum, commonly known as the smoothleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
