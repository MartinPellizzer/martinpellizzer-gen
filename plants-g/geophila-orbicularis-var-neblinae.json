    "intro": "Geophila orbicularis var. neblinae, commonly known as the Neblinae geophila, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its small, orbicular leaves and clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found at high elevations. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to the specific microclimate of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
