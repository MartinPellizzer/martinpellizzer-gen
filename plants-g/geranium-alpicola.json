    "intro": "Geranium alpicola, commonly known as the alpine geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually palmately lobed and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Geranium alpicola is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in mountain ecosystems."
