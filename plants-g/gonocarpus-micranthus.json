    "intro": "Gonocarpus micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of tropical and subtropical areas. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or muddy soils near the shoreline, exhibiting halophytic traits that allow it to tolerate saline conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or red, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Gonocarpus micranthus plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
