    "intro": "Globularia repens, commonly known as the creeping globularia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with prostrate stems that root at the nodes. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Globularia repens thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
