    "intro": "Guzmania osyana, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky red bracts that surround a central flower spike, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant features a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that collect rainwater, forming a central pool that supports aquatic life. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Guzmania osyana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
