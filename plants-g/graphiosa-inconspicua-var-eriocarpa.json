    "intro": "Graphiosa inconspicua var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the hairy-fruited sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-gray hue, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its small, clustered flowers are typically pale purple or white, blooming in summer. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats."
