    "intro": "Gypsophila repens var. alpigena, commonly known as the alpine baby's breath, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It produces clusters of small, delicate white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has thin, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often used in floral arrangements due to its fluffy, ethereal appearance. Gypsophila repens var. alpigena is hardy in USDA zones 4-8 and prefers full sun to partial shade."
