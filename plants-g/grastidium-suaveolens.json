    "intro": "Grastidium suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. Its leaves are usually scale-like and lack true stems, a characteristic common in many mistletoe species. The plant is known for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
