    "intro": "Grastidium heteroglossum, commonly known as the rainbow lily, is a striking flowering plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of vibrant, multi-colored flowers that range from deep red to bright yellow. The plant's leaves are elongated and slightly waxy, providing a striking contrast to its colorful blooms. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Grastidium heteroglossum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique visual appeal."
