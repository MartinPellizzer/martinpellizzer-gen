    "intro": "Guazuma parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved guazuma, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Guazuma parvifolia is valued for its hard wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
