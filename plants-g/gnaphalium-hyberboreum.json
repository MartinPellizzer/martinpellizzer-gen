    "intro": "Gnaphalium hyberboreum, commonly known as the northern pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Gnaphalium hyberboreum is often found in rocky, alpine, or tundra environments where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
