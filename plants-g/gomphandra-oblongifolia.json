    "intro": "Gomphandra oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gomphandra, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate, and often elliptical or ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
