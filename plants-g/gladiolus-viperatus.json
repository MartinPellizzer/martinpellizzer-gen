    "intro": "Gladiolus viperatus, commonly known as the snake-root gladiolus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves and tall, branched inflorescences. The plant produces vividly colored flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. However, due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
