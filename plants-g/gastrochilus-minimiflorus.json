    "intro": "Gastrochilus minimiflorus, commonly known as the miniature flower orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features compact, dark green leaves and produces tiny, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Its flowers are short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
