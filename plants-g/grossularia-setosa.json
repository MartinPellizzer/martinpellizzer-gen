    "intro": "Grossularia setosa, commonly known as the alpine currant, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. These berries are edible and have a tart flavor, often used in local cuisines. Grossularia setosa is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
