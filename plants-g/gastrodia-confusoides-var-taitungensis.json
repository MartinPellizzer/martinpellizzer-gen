    "intro": "Gastrodia confusoides var. taitungensis, commonly known as Taitung gastrodia, is a rare orchid species native to Taiwan. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces a single, fleshy, yellowish-brown tuber that stores energy for reproduction. It flowers in late spring, producing small, white or pale green flowers with a distinctive, sweet fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
