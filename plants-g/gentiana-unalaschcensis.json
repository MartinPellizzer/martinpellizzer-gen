    "intro": "Gentiana unalaschcensis, commonly known as the Unalashca gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Alaska Range and the Yukon Territory. It is a perennial herb with a robust root system and basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in a single, terminal inflorescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine tundra and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
