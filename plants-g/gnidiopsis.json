    "intro": "Gnidiopsis, commonly known as the horned vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, curved, horn-like structures on its stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish in color. Gnidiopsis is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
