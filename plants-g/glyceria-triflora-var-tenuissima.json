It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in width. The plant produces three-flowered spikelets, which are clustered at the ends of its stems. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in temperate regions. Its botanical structure makes it an important species for wetland ecosystems and ecological studies."
