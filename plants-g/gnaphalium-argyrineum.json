It features finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in dense, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its aromatic foliage and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions make it a common sight in many ecosystems."
