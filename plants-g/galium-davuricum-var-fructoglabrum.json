    "intro": "Galium davuricum var. fructoglabrum, commonly known as the smooth-fruited bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China and the Russian Far East. It is a low-growing perennial herb with opposite, ovate leaves that are typically hairy but become smoother along the edges. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that mature in the fall, releasing tiny seeds. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes."
