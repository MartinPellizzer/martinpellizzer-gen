    "intro": "Grewia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered gumbo, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in summer. Its fruits are small, red, fleshy drupes that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Grewia grandiflora is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in such climates."
