It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and valved fruits that split open to release seeds. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems. Its roots are adapted to tolerate waterlogged and oxygen-poor soils. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface."
