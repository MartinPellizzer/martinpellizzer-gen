    "intro": "Galium chartaceum, commonly known as paperweed or slender bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, often prostrate stems that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are opposite, oval to elliptic in shape, and have a papery texture, giving the plant its common name. Galium chartaceum is often found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
