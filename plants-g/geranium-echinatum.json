    "intro": "Geranium echinatum, commonly known as the rough geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear opposite, palmately lobed leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
