    "intro": "Gaultheria hirta, commonly known as the hairy wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Gaultheria hirta thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas. Its aromatic leaves and berries make it an important plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
