    "intro": "Goniopteris cordata, commonly known as the heart-shaped water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, cordate (heart-shaped) fronds that are often deeply divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in dense forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Goniopteris cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining wetland habitats."
