    "intro": "Galium pumilum subsp. islandicum, commonly known as the island bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to certain parts of the Pacific Northwest. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its presence is often an indicator of undisturbed, nutrient-rich soil conditions."
