    "intro": "Gypsophila saxifraga, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Gypsophila saxifraga is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to flourish in rocky garden settings."
