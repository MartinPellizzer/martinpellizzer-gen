    "intro": "Graphephorum festucaceum, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a species of grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-haired inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Graphephorum festucaceum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
