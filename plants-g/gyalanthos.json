    "intro": "Gyalanthos, commonly known as the snow lotus, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and other mountainous regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the early spring, adapting to the cold and harsh environments it inhabits. Gyalanthos is known for its medicinal properties, with its roots and leaves used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its ecological significance and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is also a subject of conservation interest."
