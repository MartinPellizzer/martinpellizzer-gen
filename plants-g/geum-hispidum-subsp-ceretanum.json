    "intro": "Geum hispidum subsp. ceretanum, commonly known as the rough avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features basal leaves that are hairy and heart-shaped, with serrated edges, and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial to full shade. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it is often found in damp meadows and along stream banks. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits to pollinators."
