    "intro": "Glaux mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It possesses small, bladder-like structures called bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with tiny, leaf-like structures called phyllodes. It produces small white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
