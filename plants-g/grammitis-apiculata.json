    "intro": "Grammitis apiculata, commonly known as the hooked fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a rosette shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis apiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens."
