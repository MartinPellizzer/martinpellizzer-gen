    "intro": "Gymnopteris cadieri, commonly known as the narrow-leafed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky areas. Gymnopteris cadieri has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
