    "intro": "Galium multiflorum var. hirsutum, commonly known as hairy wood-pile grass, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that distinguishes it from other Galium species. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the plant produces small, three-lobed berries as its fruit."
