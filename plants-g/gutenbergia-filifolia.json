It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
