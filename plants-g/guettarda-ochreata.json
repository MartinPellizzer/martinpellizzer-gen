    "intro": "Guettarda ochreata, commonly known as the golden guettarda, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in coastal and limestone areas. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture. Guettarda ochreata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in saline environments."
