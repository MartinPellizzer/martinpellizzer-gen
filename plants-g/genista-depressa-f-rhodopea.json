It features dense, dark green foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in clusters. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It is well adapted to rocky and arid soils, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
