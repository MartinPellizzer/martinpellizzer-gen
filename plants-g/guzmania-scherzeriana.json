    "intro": "Guzmania scherzeriana, commonly known as the Scherzer's guzmania, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange, often resembling a torch. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small aquatic life. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Guzmania scherzeriana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
