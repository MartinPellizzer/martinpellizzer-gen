    "intro": "Gleichenia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots along their length. Its spores are borne on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Gleichenia microphylla is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices."
