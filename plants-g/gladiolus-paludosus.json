    "intro": "Gladiolus paludosus, commonly known as the swamp gladiolus, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in South America. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting large, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its root system consists of fleshy, tuberous structures that store nutrients and water. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in marshy areas along riverbanks."
