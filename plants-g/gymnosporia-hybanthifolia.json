    "intro": "Gymnosporia hybanthifolia, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody, spherical fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange-colored aril. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a source of traditional medicine."
