    "intro": "Goniophlebium patens, commonly known as the broad-leafed liverwort, is a species of moss-like plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, flat leaves that are often arranged in a rosette-like pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are small and develop from specialized leaves called sporophylls. Goniophlebium patens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
