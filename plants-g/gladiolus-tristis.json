    "intro": "Gladiolus tristis, commonly known as the weedy gladiolus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a distinct midrib, and it produces small, three-lobed seed capsules. While not cultivated for ornamental purposes, it plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
