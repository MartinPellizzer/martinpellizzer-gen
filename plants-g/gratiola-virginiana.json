It features a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores nutrients and gives the plant its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers clustered in spikes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The roots have been historically used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
