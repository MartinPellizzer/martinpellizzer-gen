    "intro": "Gypsophila olympica, commonly known as the Olympic gypsophila, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans and the Carpathian Basin. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like inflorescences composed of numerous small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to alpine environments. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in meadows and open slopes at high altitudes. Gypsophila olympica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ethereal appearance."
