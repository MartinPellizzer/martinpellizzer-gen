It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, rounded bulbs that are adapted to survive in rocky, well-drained soils. It typically blooms in early spring and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Gagea monticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native ecosystems."
