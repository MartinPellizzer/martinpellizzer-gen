    "intro": "Gliricidia lutea, commonly known as the yellow gliricidia, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical regions. It features bipinnate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by flat, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in a variety of tropical climates. Gliricidia lutea is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing abilities, making it useful in agroforestry systems."
