    "intro": "Goniopteris crenata, commonly known as the serrated moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that are often divided into toothed segments. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Goniopteris crenata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks."
