    "intro": "Glossolepis macrobotrys, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, supported by long, spongy petioles. The plant produces showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots anchor in the mud at the bottom of still waters, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native wetlands by stabilizing water surfaces and supporting biodiversity."
