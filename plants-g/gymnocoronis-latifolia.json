    "intro": "Gymnocoronis latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf false dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South Africa. It features basal rosettes of broad, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
