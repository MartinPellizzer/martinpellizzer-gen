    "intro": "Gnaphalium uliginosum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth swamp everlasting, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flower heads, which are surrounded by soft, fuzzy leaves. The plant is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) stems and leaves, distinguishing it from other varieties of Gnaphalium. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
