    "intro": "Gaudichaudia subverticillata, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Gaudichaudia subverticillata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
