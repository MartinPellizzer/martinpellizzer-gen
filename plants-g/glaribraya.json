    "intro": "Glaribraya, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its striking, pale blue or white flowers. The plant has a low-growing, sprawling habit with narrow, silvery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Glaribraya is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers bloom at night, attracting specific moths that are essential for its pollination."
