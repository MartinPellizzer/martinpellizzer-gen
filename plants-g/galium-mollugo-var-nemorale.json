    "intro": "Galium mollugo var. nemorale, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves and flowers are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance."
