    "intro": "Gonolobus tristis, commonly known as the weeping morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, viscid substance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
