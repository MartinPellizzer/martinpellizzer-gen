    "intro": "Galphimia australis, commonly known as the Australian flame flower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure."
