    "intro": "Grammitis microglossa, commonly known as the small-lipped fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, ovate to lanceolate leaves are usually less than 1 cm in length, contributing to its intricate appearance. Grammitis microglossa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
