It features broad, glossy, dark green leaves that are often variegated with silver or white markings. The plant produces striking, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are stiff and upright, giving it a unique, architectural appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
