    "intro": "Gastrochilus oculatus, commonly known as the eye orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble eyes, with prominent yellow spots on the lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it attaches to other plants without being parasitic. The orchid's unique appearance and habitat make it a notable species in the orchid family."
