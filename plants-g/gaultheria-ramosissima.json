    "intro": "Gaultheria ramosissima, commonly known as the trailing evergreen blueberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by blue-black berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. Gaultheria ramosissima thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. It is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties."
