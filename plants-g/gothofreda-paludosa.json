    "intro": "Gothofreda paludosa, commonly known as the bog lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the wetlands of northern Europe. It thrives in acidic, waterlogged soils and is often found in peat bogs and marshes. The plant features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, recurved shape. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to the moist, nutrient-poor environment. Due to habitat loss, Gothofreda paludosa is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
