    "intro": "Genista velutina, commonly known as the velvet broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, thorny stems covered in a fine, velvety hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in racemes during the spring, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are compound, consisting of multiple pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. Genista velutina is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments."
