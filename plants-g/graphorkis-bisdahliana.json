    "intro": "Graphorkis bisdahliana, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high altitudes of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a slender rhizome and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall herbaceous appearance. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
