    "intro": "Galium avascense, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silver hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It spreads through rhizomes, forming dense mats that can colonize disturbed or wetland areas. Galium avascense is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats."
