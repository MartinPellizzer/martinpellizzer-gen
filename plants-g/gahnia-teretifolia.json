    "intro": "Gahnia teretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in wetland and swampy environments, often forming dense vegetation that stabilizes soil and provides habitat for various wildlife. Gahnia teretifolia is an important component of wetland ecosystems and is valued for its ecological role in water filtration and erosion control."
