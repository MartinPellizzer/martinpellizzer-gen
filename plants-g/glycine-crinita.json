    "intro": "Glycine crinita, commonly known as the silky beans or silky peanut vine, is a climbing legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that give way to elongated, curved pods containing edible seeds. Glycine crinita thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
