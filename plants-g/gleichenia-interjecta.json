    "intro": "Gleichenia interjecta, commonly known as the interjected fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is a terrestrial plant characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white tomentum. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant's sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a notable species in ecological and botanical studies."
