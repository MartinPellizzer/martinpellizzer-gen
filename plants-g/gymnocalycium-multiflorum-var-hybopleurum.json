    "intro": "Gymnocalycium multiflorum var. hybopleurum, commonly known as the Hybopleurum cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It features a smooth, pale green body with prominent ribs and spines that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
