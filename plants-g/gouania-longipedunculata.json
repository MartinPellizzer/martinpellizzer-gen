    "intro": "Gouania longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-stemmed gouania, is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive floral structures and leaf morphology. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central and South America, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with prominent veins and small, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny, greenish-white flowers. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and the plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Gouania longipedunculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
