    "intro": "Genlisea stapfii, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic invertebrates. The plant is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in wetlands and marshy areas. Its leaves are modified into specialized bladders that function as traps, while its roots absorb nutrients from the water. Genlisea stapfii is a small, herbaceous plant that plays a role in nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
