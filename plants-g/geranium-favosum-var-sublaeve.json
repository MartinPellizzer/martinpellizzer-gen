It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to red. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth, waxy texture that distinguishes it from other geranium varieties. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This plant is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
