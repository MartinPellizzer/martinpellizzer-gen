    "intro": "Guzmania gloriosa, commonly known as the royal bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that resembles a crown, which is why it is often called the \"crown of the forest.\" The plant features a rosette of waxy, strap-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small aquatic environment for microorganisms and small animals. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, are short-lived but highly showy. Guzmania gloriosa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
