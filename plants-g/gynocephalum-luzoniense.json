    "intro": "Gynocephalum luzoniense, commonly known as the Luzon moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive umbellate inflorescence. The plant features compound leaves with a pinnate structure and produces small, white flowers that bloom at night. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, where it thrives in the understory vegetation. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
