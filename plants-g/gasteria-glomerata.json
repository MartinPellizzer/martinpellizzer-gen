    "intro": "Gasteria glomerata, commonly known as the clustered gasteria, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with white or pale markings. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, tubular flowers that are typically white or yellow. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves. Gasteria glomerata is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its hardiness and ornamental appearance."
