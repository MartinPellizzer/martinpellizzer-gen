    "intro": "Gasteranthus mutabilis, commonly known as the \"changing flower\" or \"flower of the night,\" is a unique member of the Malvaceae family. It is native to the Andes Mountains of South America, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant is notable for its striking, showy flowers that change color and shape as they mature, typically transitioning from white to purple or red. Its flowers open at night and emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Gasteranthus mutabilis is considered a delicate and somewhat elusive species in the botanical world."
