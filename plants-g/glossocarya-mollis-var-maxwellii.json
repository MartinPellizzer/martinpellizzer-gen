    "intro": "Glossocarya mollis var. maxwellii, commonly known as Maxwell's glossocarya, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features small, dark green leaves that are densely packed, providing a dense cover. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, which bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
