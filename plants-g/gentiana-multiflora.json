    "intro": "Gentiana multiflora, commonly known as the mountain gentian, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces a tall, unbranched stem. Gentiana multiflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it an important species in alpine ecosystems."
