It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Gypsophila paulii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils."
