    "intro": "Goniophlebium brasiliense var. preslianum, commonly known as the Brazilian fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sporangia located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
