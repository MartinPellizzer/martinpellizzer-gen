    "intro": "Genista sessilifolia subsp. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves that give it its subspecies name. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or coastal environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
