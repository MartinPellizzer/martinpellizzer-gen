    "intro": "Gymnogramma lherminieri, commonly known as the Lherminier's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Gymnogramma lherminieri is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits in aquatic ecosystems."
