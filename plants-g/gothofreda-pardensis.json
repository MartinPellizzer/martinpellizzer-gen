    "intro": "Gothofreda pardensis, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in a dense layer of golden-yellow spores. The plant's leaves are leathery and glossy, providing a unique visual contrast in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gothofreda pardensis is considered a vulnerable species."
