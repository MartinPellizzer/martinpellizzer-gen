    "intro": "Galactia cesarii, commonly known as the Caesar's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical pods containing small, round seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Galactia cesarii plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
