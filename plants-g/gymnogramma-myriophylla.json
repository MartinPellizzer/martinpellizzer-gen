    "intro": "Gymnogramma myriophylla, commonly known as the feather-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that give it a lacy appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. It is often found in forest undergrowth, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the understory vegetation."
