    "intro": "Gagea villosa, commonly known as the hairy gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open woodlands and meadows. Its bulbs are small and covered in a fibrous sheath, which helps in storing water and nutrients. Gagea villosa is often found in moist, well-drained habitats and is adapted to thrive in cooler climates."
