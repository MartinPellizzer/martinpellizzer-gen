    "intro": "Geranium nepalense f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered geranium, is a botanical variant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and serrated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, showy white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and striking white blooms, which contrast beautifully with its green leaves."
