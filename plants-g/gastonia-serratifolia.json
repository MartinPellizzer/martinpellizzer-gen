    "intro": "Gastonia serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated leaf cycad, is a unique plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that often develops a fibrous sheath. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered an important species for conservation efforts."
