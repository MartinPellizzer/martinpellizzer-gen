    "intro": "Galium longiapiculatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial with slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Galium longiapiculatum is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
