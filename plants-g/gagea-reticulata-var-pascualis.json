    "intro": "Gagea reticulata var. pascualis, commonly known as the Pascual's netleaf squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the western United States. It features a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers. The plant is characterized by its reticulate (net-like) patterns on the leaves, which give it its specific epithet. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The bulbs are used in traditional medicine and are also cultivated for their ornamental value."
