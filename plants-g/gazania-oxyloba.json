    "intro": "Gazania oxyloba, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, daisy-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Gazania oxyloba is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and salt spray, which contributes to its hardiness in coastal regions."
