It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant is notable for its vivid purple flowers, which contrast sharply with its green, finely divided leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
