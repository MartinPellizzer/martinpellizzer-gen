It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant produces dense clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Gomphrena perennis subf. ramosa is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
