    "intro": "Galium trachyspermum var. hispidum, commonly known as hairy bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its hairy texture and compact growth habit make it a distinctive feature in its native habitats."
