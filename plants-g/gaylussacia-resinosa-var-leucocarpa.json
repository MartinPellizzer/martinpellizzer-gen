    "intro": "Gaylussacia resinosa var. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its berries are edible for birds and small mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and pine forests."
