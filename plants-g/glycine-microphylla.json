It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and erect, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds. Glycine microphylla is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches soil fertility. It is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop in some regions."
