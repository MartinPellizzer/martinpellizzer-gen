    "intro": "Galenia pruinosa, commonly known as the silverleaf galenia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a distinctive, slightly fuzzy texture. Galenia pruinosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
