    "intro": "Gnaphalium supinum var. fuscum, commonly known as the brown sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Small, yellowish-white flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, typical of the Asteraceae family. This plant is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas."
