    "intro": "Guzmania strobilantha, commonly known as the spike-tipped bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that resembles a spike, often displaying vivid red, orange, or yellow hues. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and invertebrates. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Guzmania strobilantha thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
