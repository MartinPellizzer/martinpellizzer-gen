    "intro": "Galium forsteri, commonly known as Forster's bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and is often found in California and Oregon. Galium forsteri plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
