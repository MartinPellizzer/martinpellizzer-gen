It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pentagonal-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. Due to habitat loss, Gymneia interrupta is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
