    "intro": "Galarhoeus sieboldianus var. idzuensis, commonly known as the Izu mountain bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Japan. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue-violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in mountainous regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
