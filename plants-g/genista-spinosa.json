    "intro": "Genista spinosa, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub characterized by its slender, spiny stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various environments. Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is often considered a weed in non-native habitats."
