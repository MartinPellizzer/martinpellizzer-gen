    "intro": "Geissois hippocastanifolia, commonly known as the golden trumpet tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its showy, yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. Its bark is smooth and greyish, becoming fissured with age. The golden trumpet tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
