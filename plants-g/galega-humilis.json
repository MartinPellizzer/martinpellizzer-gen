    "intro": "Galega humilis, commonly known as the lesser goat's rue, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Galega humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional herbal medicine."
