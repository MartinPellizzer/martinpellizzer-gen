    "intro": "Galium axillare, commonly known as white wood-sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically in clusters at the leaf axils. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a hairy texture, while the stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. Galium axillare thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
