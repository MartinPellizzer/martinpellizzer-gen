    "intro": "Gossypium kirkii subsp. brevilanatum, commonly known as the short-leaved cottonweed, is a wild cotton species native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, pale green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces fluffy, white bolls containing fibrous seeds, similar to other cotton species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
