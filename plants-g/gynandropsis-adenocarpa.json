    "intro": "Gynandropsis adenocarpa, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Gynandropsis adenocarpa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought conditions."
