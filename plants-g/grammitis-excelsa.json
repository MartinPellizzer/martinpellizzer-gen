    "intro": "Grammitis excelsa, commonly known as the tall fern or slender hart's-tongue fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that often form dense, cascading clusters. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its roots to anchor itself without deriving nutrients from its host. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, narrow shape that resembles a tongue. Grammitis excelsa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
