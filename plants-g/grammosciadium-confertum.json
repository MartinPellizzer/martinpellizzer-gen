    "intro": "Grammosciadium confertum, commonly known as the broadleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a slightly wavy margin, and the plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Grammosciadium confertum is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
