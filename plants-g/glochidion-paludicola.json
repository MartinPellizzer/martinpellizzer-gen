    "intro": "Glochidion paludicola, commonly known as the swamp glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in swampy forests and along riverbanks. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by water. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
