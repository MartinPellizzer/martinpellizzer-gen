    "intro": "Grammitis adspersa, commonly known as the stellate grammitis, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in tiny, star-shaped structures called stellate trichomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid forests. Its small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves. Grammitis adspersa is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
