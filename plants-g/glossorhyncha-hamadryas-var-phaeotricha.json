    "intro": "Glossorhyncha hamadryas var. phaeotricha, commonly known as the dark-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It possesses a unique root system that allows it to absorb water and nutrients from its host, while also conducting photosynthesis. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are usually dark green and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a distinctive, aromatic scent to attract pollinators. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
