    "intro": "Goniopteris tenera, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in swampy areas. Its rhizomes are submerged or partially submerged, anchoring it in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of the fronds."
