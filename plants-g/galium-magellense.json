    "intro": "Galium magellense, commonly known as the Magellanic bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features opposite, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters. It blooms during the spring and early summer, and its fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind. Galium magellense is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
