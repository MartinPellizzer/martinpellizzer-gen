    "intro": "Gentiana woodii, commonly known as the Wood's gentian, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the Appalachian Mountains. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers and lance-shaped leaves. The plant is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats. It has small, delicate flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are usually arranged in a basal rosette. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is critically endangered and protected in many regions."
