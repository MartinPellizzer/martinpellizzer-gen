    "intro": "Geonoma costatifrons, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its fronds are often bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's intricate leaf structure and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
