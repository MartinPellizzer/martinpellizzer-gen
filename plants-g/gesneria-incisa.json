    "intro": "Gesneria incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gesneria, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria incisa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
