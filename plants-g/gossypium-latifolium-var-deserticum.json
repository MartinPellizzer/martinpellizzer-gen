    "intro": "Gossypium latifolium var. deserticum, commonly known as desert cotton, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, woolly leaves and produces small, pink to white flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Its fibers, while not typically harvested for commercial cotton, have been used historically by indigenous peoples for various purposes. The species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
