    "intro": "Graptopetalum glassii, commonly known as the Glass Stonecrop, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable addition to many succulent collections."
