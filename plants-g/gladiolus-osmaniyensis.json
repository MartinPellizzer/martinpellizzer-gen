    "intro": "Gladiolus osmaniyensis, commonly known as the Osmaniyeh gladiolus, is a rare and striking plant native to Turkey. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing large, colorful inflorescences that resemble swords, a feature typical of the gladiolus genus. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a dense, upright pattern. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native region."
