    "intro": "Gerardia paupercula f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered gerardia, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. This variant is distinguished by its pale floral display, which sets it apart from other forms of Gerardia paupercula."
