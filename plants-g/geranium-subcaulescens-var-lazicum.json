    "intro": "Geranium subcaulescens var. lazicum, commonly known as the Lazic geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Eastern Mediterranean. It features upright, slender stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged flowering period."
