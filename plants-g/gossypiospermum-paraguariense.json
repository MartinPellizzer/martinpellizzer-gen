It is native to South America, particularly found in Paraguay and Brazil. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and large, palmate leaves. It produces yellow flowers that eventually develop into capsules containing numerous seeds. The seeds are encased in a fibrous husk, which is used for oil extraction and as a source of fiber."
