    "intro": "Galium angustifolium subsp. onycense, commonly known as silverweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and roadside areas. The plant has slender, ascending stems that are covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and alternate, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss."
