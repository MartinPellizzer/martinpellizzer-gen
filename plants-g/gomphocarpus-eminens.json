    "intro": "Gomphocarpus eminens, commonly known as the tall milkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its latex sap is milky and contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Gomphocarpus eminens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas."
