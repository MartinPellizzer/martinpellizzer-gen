    "intro": "Gentianodes sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim gentian, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, which includes many species with showy blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and forest understories. Its flowers are characterized by their vibrant blue petals and a prominent yellow throat, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
