    "intro": "Geranium dissectum f. erectum, commonly known as the upright geranium, is a compact, herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It features upright, branching stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are deeply lobed and dissected, creating a delicate, lace-like texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers."
