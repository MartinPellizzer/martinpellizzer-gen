    "intro": "Goniothalamus flagellistylus, commonly known as the long-styled goniothalamus, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated stamens that extend beyond the petals. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a fragrant scent, which attract pollinators such as bees and wasps. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a smooth or slightly pubescent surface. The fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains several seeds, typical of many species in the Annonaceae family."
