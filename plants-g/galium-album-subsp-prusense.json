It features slender, ascending stems that are often hairy, with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually gland-dotted. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves and stems are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their mild diuretic properties."
