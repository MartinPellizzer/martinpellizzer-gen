    "intro": "Genlisea pygmaea, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habit and possesses specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant's leaves are typically reduced to thread-like structures, while the bladders are bladder-like organs that function as passive traps. Genlisea pygmaea thrives in nutrient-poor environments, often found in wetlands or shallow water bodies. Its unique adaptations make it an interesting subject for studying plant carnivory and ecological niche specialization."
