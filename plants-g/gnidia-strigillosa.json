    "intro": "Gnidia strigillosa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed gnidia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its woody stems covered in stiff, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are typically visited by various pollinators. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Gnidia strigillosa is often found in rocky or wooded areas and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
