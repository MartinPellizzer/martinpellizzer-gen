    "intro": "Geonoma aspidiifolia subsp. aspidiifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed geonoma, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, lanceolate leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, broad, spear-shaped appearance. The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves, a common feature in many fern species."
