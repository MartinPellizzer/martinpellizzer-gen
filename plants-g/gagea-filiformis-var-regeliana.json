It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its bulbs are relatively small and serve as storage organs for nutrients. This variety is noted for its delicate appearance and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
