    "intro": "Geitonoplesium scandens, commonly known as the climbing starfruit or climbing custard apple, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its rapid growth habit and ability to climb using its tendrils. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruit but often larger and more elongated. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a glossy surface and a slightly serrated margin. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits in suitable climates."
