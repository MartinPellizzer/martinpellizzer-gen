    "intro": "Gentianella thiosphaera var. thiosphaera, commonly known as the sulfur globe gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly areas. Its unique flower structure and vibrant color make it a notable species in alpine flora."
