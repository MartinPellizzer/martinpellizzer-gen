    "intro": "Gaultheria minutiflora var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular strawberry bush, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South America. It features dense clusters of small, glandular-tipped leaves that give it its specific epithet. The plant produces tiny, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate rainforests. Its botanical characteristics make it a valued plant in horticulture and ecological restoration projects."
