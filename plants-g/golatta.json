    "intro": "Golatta, commonly known as the golden tamarind, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with smooth, greyish-brown bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated, woody pods containing several seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. The fruit, while not commonly consumed, is sometimes used in local crafts and as a natural dye."
