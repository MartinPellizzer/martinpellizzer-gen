    "intro": "Gerrardanthus portentosus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, pale green to white flowers that are often described as ghostly due to their translucent appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to specific microclimates. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a vulnerable species."
