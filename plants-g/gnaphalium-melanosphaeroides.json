    "intro": "Gnaphalium melanosphaeroides, commonly known as the black-sphere everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is often found in rocky or dry habitats, thriving in full sun."
