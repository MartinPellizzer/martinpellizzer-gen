    "intro": "Goydera somaliense, commonly known as the Somali goydera, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Somalia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and has adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense, spherical heads, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
