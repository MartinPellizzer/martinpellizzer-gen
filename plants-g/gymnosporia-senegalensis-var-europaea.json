    "intro": "Gymnosporia senegalensis var. europaea, commonly known as the European African thornapple, is a shrub native to parts of Africa and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its spiny stems and alternate leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. Due to its thorny structure, it is often used as a hedge or barrier plant in landscaping."
