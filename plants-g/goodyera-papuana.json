    "intro": "Goodyera papuana, commonly known as the Papuan maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like foliage and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in the understory of tropical forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Goodyera papuana is considered vulnerable and is often protected in conservation programs."
