    "intro": "Gymnogramma \u00d7 herzogii, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a species resulting from the cross between Gymnogramma cuneata and Gymnogramma lineata. It is a polycarpic fern, meaning it can produce spores multiple times throughout its lifespan. The plant features lanceolate to ovate leaves with a serrated margin, and its fronds are typically bright green with a slightly leathery texture. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The hybrid exhibits characteristics of both parent species, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
