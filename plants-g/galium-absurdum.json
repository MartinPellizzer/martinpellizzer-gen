    "intro": "Galium absurdum, commonly known as the absurd wood-sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. It has a low-growing habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
