    "intro": "Gossypium barbadense subsp. racemosum, commonly known as the wild cotton of the Caribbean, is a species native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant produces fluffy, white fibers encasing its seeds, which are harvested for their textile properties. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and riverbanks. This subspecies is less commonly cultivated than its domesticated relatives but plays an important role in the genetic diversity of cotton species."
