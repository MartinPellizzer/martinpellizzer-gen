It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland deserts. Its leaves are glandular and emit a strong, resinous odor when crushed. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to arid environments and its role in supporting local pollinators."
