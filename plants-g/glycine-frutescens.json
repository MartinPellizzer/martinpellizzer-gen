    "intro": "Glycine frutescens, commonly known as the climbing bean or scarlet runner bean, is a leguminous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vigorous climbing habit, with compound leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to pink and red. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in culinary applications. Glycine frutescens has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil. It thrives in warm climates and is widely cultivated for both its ornamental value and nutritional benefits."
