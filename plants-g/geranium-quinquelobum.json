    "intro": "Geranium quinquelobum, commonly known as the five-lobed geranium, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves with five distinct lobes, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, often with a contrasting dark center. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
