    "intro": "Geonoma laxiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered geonoma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in a spadix-like structure, and are usually greenish-white in color. Geonoma laxiflora is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in low-light conditions."
