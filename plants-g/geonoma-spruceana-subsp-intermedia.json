    "intro": "Geonoma spruceana subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and cloud forests. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in nutrient absorption. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
