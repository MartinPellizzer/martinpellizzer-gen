    "intro": "Gaultheria poeppigii, commonly known as the Andean wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, spicy flavor due to the presence of methyl salicylate. Gaultheria poeppigii is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant."
