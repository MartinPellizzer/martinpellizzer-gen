    "intro": "Gaultheria candida, commonly known as the white-flowered wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are edible and contain seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Gaultheria candida is also valued for its aromatic leaves, which contain methyl salicylate, a compound used in traditional medicine."
