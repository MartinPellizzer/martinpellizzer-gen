    "intro": "Glyceria laxa, commonly known as the slender glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. Glyceria laxa is an important component of wetland ecosystems, supporting a variety of wildlife."
