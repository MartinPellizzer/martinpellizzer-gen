It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, milky sap. The plant is known for its ability to inhibit sweet taste perception, a property attributed to the presence of gymnemic acids. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded areas. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both traditional medicine and modern pharmacological research."
