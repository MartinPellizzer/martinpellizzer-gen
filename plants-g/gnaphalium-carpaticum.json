    "intro": "Gnaphalium carpaticum, commonly known as the Carpathian everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Carpathian region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, fluffy florets that are often mistaken for individual flowers, and it is known for its aromatic, slightly bitter scent. Gnaphalium carpaticum typically grows in rocky or dry habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its fibrous, creeping stems and silvery-gray leaves help it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
