    "intro": "Grammatophyllum leopardinum, commonly known as the leopard orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, large, and showy flowers that often display a pattern resembling a leopard's spots, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its inflorescence is a raceme of fragrant, orchid-like blooms that can vary in color from white to yellow and pink. Grammatophyllum leopardinum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
