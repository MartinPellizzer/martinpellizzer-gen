    "intro": "Gaultheria tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender-leaved wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, peppery flavor, making them popular in local cuisine and traditional medicine. Gaultheria tenuifolia is also valued for its aromatic leaves, which contain compounds used in perfumes and as a natural remedy."
