    "intro": "Grindelia oxylepis, commonly known as desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
