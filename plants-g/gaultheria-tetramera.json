    "intro": "Gaultheria tetramera, commonly known as the four-leaved wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and parts of Canada. It produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Gaultheria tetramera is also valued for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
