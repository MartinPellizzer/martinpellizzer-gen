    "intro": "Gleichenia lanuginosa, commonly known as the downy Gleichenia, is a fern that belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its soft, hairy fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Gleichenia lanuginosa is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
