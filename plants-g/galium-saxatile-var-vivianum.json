    "intro": "Galium saxatile var. vivianum, commonly known as the alpine bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas and supports local pollinators."
