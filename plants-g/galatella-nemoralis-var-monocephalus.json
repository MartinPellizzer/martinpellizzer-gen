    "intro": "Galatella nemoralis var. monocephalus, commonly known as the single-headed galatella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, woodland environments and features a single, upright stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitats. It is often found in shaded, humid areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
