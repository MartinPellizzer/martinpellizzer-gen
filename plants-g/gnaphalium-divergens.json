    "intro": "Gnaphalium divergens, commonly known as the slender cudweed, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers and hairy, often glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in various parts of Europe and Asia. Its capitula consist of both ray and disk florets, which are arranged in a dense, compact head. Gnaphalium divergens is often used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
