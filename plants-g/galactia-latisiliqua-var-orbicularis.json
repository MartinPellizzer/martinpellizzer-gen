    "intro": "Galactia latisiliqua var. orbicularis, commonly known as the broad-leaved galactia, is a variant of the species native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its orbicular, or rounded, leaves that are typically larger than those of the standard variety. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It is a legume, meaning it belongs to the Fabaceae family, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules. This variant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or open areas."
