    "intro": "Grastidium vernicosum, commonly known as the winter's breath, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a short, herbaceous stem with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Grastidium vernicosum is considered a vulnerable species."
