The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy, glandular leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Its unique morphology and adaptation to arid environments make it an important species in ecological studies of xerophytic flora."
