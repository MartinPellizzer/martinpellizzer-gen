    "intro": "Gentianella angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a hairy texture. Gentianella angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
