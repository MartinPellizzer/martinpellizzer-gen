    "intro": "Gaultheria hartwegiana, commonly known as the Hartweg's wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, peppery flavor, similar to that of the common wintergreen. Gaultheria hartwegiana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
