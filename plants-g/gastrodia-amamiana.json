    "intro": "Gastrodia amamiana, commonly known as the Amami ginseng, is a rare orchid species native to the Amami Islands of Japan. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces a single, fleshy, yellowish-brown tuber that is the primary part used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and is highly sensitive to environmental disturbances. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Gastrodia amamiana is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
