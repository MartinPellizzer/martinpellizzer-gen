It is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, stalked clusters at the tips of the branches. Grammitis scolopendrioides plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
