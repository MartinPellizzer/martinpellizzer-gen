    "intro": "Gaultheria sclerophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically silver-gray in color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in late spring. Its berries, which are red and edible, contain a high concentration of methyl salicylate, giving them a distinctive wintergreen scent. Gaultheria sclerophylla thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories."
