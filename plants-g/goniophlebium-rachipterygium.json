    "intro": "Goniophlebium rachipterygium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that bear spirally arranged leaves, which are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
