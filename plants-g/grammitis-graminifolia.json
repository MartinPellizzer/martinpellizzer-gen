    "intro": "Grammitis graminifolia, commonly known as the grassy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like fronds that are often arranged in a rosette. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water in humid environments. Grammitis graminifolia is often found in shaded, moist forest understories where it thrives in low-light conditions."
