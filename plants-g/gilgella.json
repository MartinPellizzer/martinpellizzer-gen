It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a distinctive, woolly appearance. Gilgella species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are often found in savanna and woodland habitats. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
