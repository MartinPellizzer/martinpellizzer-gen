    "intro": "Geranium confertum, commonly known as the clustered geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that bear clusters of small, pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically rounded or heart-shaped, with serrated edges, and are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
