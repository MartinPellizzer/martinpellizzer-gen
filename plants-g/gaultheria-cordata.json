    "intro": "Gaultheria cordata, commonly known as the evergreen wintergreen, is a low-growing shrub native to the temperate regions of the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It features glossy, dark green elliptical leaves that remain evergreen throughout the year. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, edible berries in the fall. These berries are rich in methylsalicylate, a compound responsible for the plant's characteristic wintergreen scent. Gaultheria cordata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties."
