It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are typically covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its flowers are tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a hardy species suitable for cultivation in dry climates."
