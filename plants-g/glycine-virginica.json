    "intro": "Glycine virginica, commonly known as the Carolina wild bean, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by cylindrical, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Glycine virginica has a fibrous root system and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities."
