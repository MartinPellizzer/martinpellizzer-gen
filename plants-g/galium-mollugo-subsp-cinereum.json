    "intro": "Galium mollugo subsp. cinereum, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, silvery hairs that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Silverweed is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
