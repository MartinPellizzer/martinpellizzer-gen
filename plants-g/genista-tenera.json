    "intro": "Genista tenera, commonly known as the silky broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it adaptable to rocky or sandy environments. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and long-lasting blooms, which appear in spring. Genista tenera is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid landscapes."
