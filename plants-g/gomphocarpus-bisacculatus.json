    "intro": "Gomphocarpus bisacculatus, commonly known as the blue milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain the toxic latex used by some animals for defense. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Its showy blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though caution is advised due to its toxic properties."
