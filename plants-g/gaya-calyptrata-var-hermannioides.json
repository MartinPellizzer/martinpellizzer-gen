    "intro": "Gaya calyptrata var. hermannioides, commonly known as the Hermann's gaya, is a rare variant of the gaya calyptrata species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a distinct midrib and serrated margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, clustered in axillary inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland rainforests or secondary growth areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
