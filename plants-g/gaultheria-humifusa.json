    "intro": "Gaultheria humifusa, commonly known as the creeping wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year, providing dense ground cover. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, peppery flavor, often used in culinary applications. Gaultheria humifusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
