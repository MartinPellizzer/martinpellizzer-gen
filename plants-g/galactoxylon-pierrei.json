It belongs to the family Oliniariaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant has compound leaves with alternate arrangement and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and habitat loss, Galactoxylon pierrei is considered endangered."
