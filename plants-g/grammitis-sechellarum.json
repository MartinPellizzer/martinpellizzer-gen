    "intro": "Grammitis sechellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles spiky fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Seychelles. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spiky fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its small, clustered spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Grammitis sechellarum is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
