    "intro": "Gymnogramma schizophylla, commonly known as the split-leaf spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often divided into three unequal lobes. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are short and clustered, anchoring it to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Gymnogramma schizophylla plays a minor but ecologically significant role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization."
