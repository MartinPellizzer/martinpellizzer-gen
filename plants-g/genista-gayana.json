    "intro": "Genista gayana, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, wiry stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Genista gayana is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
