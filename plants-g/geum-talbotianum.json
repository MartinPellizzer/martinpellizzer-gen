    "intro": "Geum talbotianum, commonly known as Talbot's avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its natural habitat. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions."
