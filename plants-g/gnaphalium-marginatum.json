It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often surrounded by pale green bracts, giving it a delicate appearance. It is typically found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is known for its longevity, with some species retaining their dried flower heads for extended periods, contributing to its common name."
