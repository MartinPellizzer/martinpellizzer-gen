It is characterized by its small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Grewia lepidopetala is often found in coastal and sandy habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
