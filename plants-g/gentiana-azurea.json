    "intro": "Gentiana azurea, commonly known as the blue gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and alpine meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of down, while its stems are usually unbranched and somewhat woody at the base. Gentiana azurea is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
