    "intro": "Geophila melanocarpa, commonly known as the blackfruit geophila, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, dark-colored berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions for horticultural purposes."
