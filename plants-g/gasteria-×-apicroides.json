    "intro": "Gasteria \u00d7 apicroides, commonly known as the Zulu candle or Zulu torch, is a hybrid succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy coating that helps it store water. The leaves are typically narrow and pointed, giving the plant a candle-like appearance. It produces small, white or pale green flowers on tall, upright stems during the spring or summer. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
