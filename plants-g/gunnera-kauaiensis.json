    "intro": "Gunnera kauaiensis, commonly known as the Kauai giant shield fern, is a striking plant native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is characterized by its large, broad, shield-shaped leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in streamside habitats. Its unique morphology makes it a notable species within the Gunneraceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
