    "intro": "Globulariopsis, commonly known as the globular violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, globular or rounded flower heads, which resemble tiny violets. They typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are usually opposite and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Globulariopsis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique floral display."
