    "intro": "Gomphocarpus rivularis, commonly known as the river milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves that are oval-shaped with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which attract various pollinators. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Gomphocarpus rivularis typically grows in moist, sandy soils near water sources, making it a common sight in riverine habitats."
