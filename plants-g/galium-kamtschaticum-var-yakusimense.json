    "intro": "Galium kamtschaticum var. yakusimense, commonly known as Yakusimense bedstraw, is a flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in areas of the Russian Far East and northern Japan. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It produces small white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are opposite, simple, and often hairy. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Galium kamtschaticum."
