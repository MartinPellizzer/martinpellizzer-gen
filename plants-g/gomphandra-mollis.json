    "intro": "Gomphandra mollis, commonly known as the slender gomphandra, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Theaceae, which includes camellias and other ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
