    "intro": "Gnaphalium callilepis, commonly known as the silverleaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are usually silver-gray in color, covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gnaphalium callilepis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
