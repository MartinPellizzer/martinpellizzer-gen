    "intro": "Gnaphalium saturejifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features small, daisy-like yellow flowers surrounded by white to pale blue ray florets. Its leaves are silvery-gray due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
