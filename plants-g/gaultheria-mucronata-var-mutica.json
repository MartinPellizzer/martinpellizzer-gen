    "intro": "Gaultheria mucronata var. mutica, commonly known as the hairy waxleaf wintergreen, is a species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are densely covered with short, soft hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and birds. Its leaves contain methyl salicylate, giving it a distinctive wintergreen scent and making it valuable in herbal medicine. The hairy waxleaf wintergreen thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas."
