    "intro": "Galium saxatile subsp. vivianum, commonly known as the alpine bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and limestone habitats. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are opposite, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. It is characterized by its slender stems and ability to tolerate cold and harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
