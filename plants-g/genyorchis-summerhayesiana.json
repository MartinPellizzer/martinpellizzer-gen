    "intro": "Genyorchis summerhayesiana, commonly known as the Summerhayes' orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its often harsh and arid environment. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
