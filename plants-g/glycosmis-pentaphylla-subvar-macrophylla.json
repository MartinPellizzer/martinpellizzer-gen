    "intro": "Glycosmis pentaphylla subvar. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf sweet apple tree, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that are typically larger than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, sweet, and aromatic fruits. The fruits are generally orange-yellow in color and have a crisp, juicy texture. This subvariety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its culinary uses in traditional dishes."
