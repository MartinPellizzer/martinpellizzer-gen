    "intro": "Gymnotheca raddiana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its valuable timber, it has been heavily harvested, leading to its classification as an endangered species in many regions."
