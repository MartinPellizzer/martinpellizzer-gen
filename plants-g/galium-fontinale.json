It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often prostrate or trailing, and it has a fibrous root system. Galium fontinale is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and along the edges of ponds."
