    "intro": "Gouldia terminalis f. acuta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gouldia, is a striking ornamental plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and vibrant, colorful bracts that range from red to orange and yellow. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy inflorescences. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This cultivar is often used in gardens for its long-lasting, eye-catching display."
