    "intro": "Gerascanthus chamissonianus, commonly known as the coastal geranium, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is a low-growing perennial with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to coastal climates. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in coastal scrub and dune habitats."
