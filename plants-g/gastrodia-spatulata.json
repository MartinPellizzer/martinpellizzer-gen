    "intro": "Gastrodia spatulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the subtropical regions of eastern Australia. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrition. The plant produces a single, showy, white or pale green flower with a distinctive, spatulate lip. It is typically found growing on the trunks of eucalyptus trees in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in several Australian states."
