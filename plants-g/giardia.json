    "intro": "Giardia, commonly known as giardia lamblia, is not a plant but a parasitic protozoan. It is a single-celled organism that causes giardiasis, a diarrheal illness in humans and animals. While it is not botanically classified as a plant, it is often mistakenly referred to in discussions about waterborne diseases. Giardia lacks the complex structures found in plants, such as roots, stems, and leaves. Instead, it thrives in aquatic environments and spreads through contaminated water sources."
