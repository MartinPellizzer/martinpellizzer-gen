    "intro": "Gothofreda siliculae, commonly known as the silica-leaf orchid, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific arid regions. It is characterized by its unique, silica-rich leaves that provide structural support and reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pale green or white, adapting to low-light conditions. Its root system is highly efficient at absorbing moisture from the soil, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Gothofreda siliculae is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
