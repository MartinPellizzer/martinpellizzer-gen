It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, ascending stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that dehisce to release seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
