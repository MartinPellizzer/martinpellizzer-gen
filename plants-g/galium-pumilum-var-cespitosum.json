    "intro": "Galium pumilum var. cespitosum, commonly known as creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces tiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats."
