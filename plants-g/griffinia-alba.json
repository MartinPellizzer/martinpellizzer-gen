    "intro": "Griffinia alba, commonly known as the white griffinia, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking white petals and delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental species. Griffinia alba thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
