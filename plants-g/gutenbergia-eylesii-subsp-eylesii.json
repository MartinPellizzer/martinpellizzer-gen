    "intro": "Gutenbergia eylesii subsp. eylesii, commonly known as the Eyles' Gutenbergia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the familyApiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its flowers are small and white, clustered in umbels, and it produces distinctive, elongated fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
