    "intro": "Guettarda protracta var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed guettarda, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements. The varietal name 'brevipes' refers to its shorter stems compared to the typical form of Guettarda protracta."
