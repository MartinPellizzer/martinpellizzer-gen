    "intro": "Gardenia imperialis subsp. physophylla, commonly known as the imperial gardenia, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, waxy, and highly fragrant white flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are thick, glossy, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the showy blooms. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
