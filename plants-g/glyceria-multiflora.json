    "intro": "Glyceria multiflora, commonly known as the broadleaf watergrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems. Glyceria multiflora is valued for its ability to filter water and support aquatic life."
