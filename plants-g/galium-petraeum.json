    "intro": "Galium petraeum, commonly known as the rock bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It typically features slender stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in rocky environments, making it well adapted to harsh conditions. Galium petraeum is often found in crevices and on cliffs, where it thrives in poor, well-drained soils."
