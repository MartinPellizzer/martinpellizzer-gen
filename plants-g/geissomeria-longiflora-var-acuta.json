    "intro": "Geissomeria longiflora var. acuta, commonly known as the sharp-flowered gooseberry, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an attractive and hardy addition to native plant gardens."
