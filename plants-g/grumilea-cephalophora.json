    "intro": "Grumilea cephalophora, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique helmet-shaped flower, which gives it its common name and makes it easily identifiable. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually a vibrant mix of red, orange, and yellow, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Grumilea cephalophora is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
