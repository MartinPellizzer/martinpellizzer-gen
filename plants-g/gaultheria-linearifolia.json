    "intro": "Gaultheria linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Gaultheria linearifolia is valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
