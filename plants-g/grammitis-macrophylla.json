    "intro": "Grammitis macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf mossy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of moss-like structures. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, forming dense, mat-like colonies. Its fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Grammitis macrophylla is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
