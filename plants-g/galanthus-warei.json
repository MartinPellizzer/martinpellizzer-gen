    "intro": "Galanthus warei, commonly known as the Welsh mountain snowdrop, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Wales. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland areas and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Galanthus warei is notable for its resilience in cold climates and its role in the conservation of alpine flora. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its natural habitat."
