    "intro": "Gymnogramma aureonitens, commonly known as the golden-stippled holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often adorned with golden or yellowish markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Gymnogramma aureonitens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
