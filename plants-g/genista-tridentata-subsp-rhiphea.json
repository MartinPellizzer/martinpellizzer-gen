    "intro": "Genista tridentata subsp. rhiphea, commonly known as the creeping yellow broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by narrow, linear leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soils make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
