    "intro": "Gesneria longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved gesneria, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria longifolia is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
