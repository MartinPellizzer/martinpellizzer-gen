    "intro": "Glechoma macrura, commonly known as greater ground-ivy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with square stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in whorls along the stems, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically aromatic and can be used in culinary applications, though it is more commonly found in wild or cultivated settings. Glechoma macrura is often considered a weed in gardens but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
