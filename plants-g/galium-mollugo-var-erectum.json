    "intro": "Galium mollugo var. erectum, commonly known as upright wood sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its erect growth habit, distinguishing it from the more prostrate form of the species. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is often found in association with other early successional plant species."
