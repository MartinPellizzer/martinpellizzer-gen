    "intro": "Gossypium frutescens var. maritimum, commonly known as sea cotton, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is a shrub characterized by its erect growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces fluffy, white bolls that contain fibrous seeds, similar to other cotton species. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found along coastal dunes and rocky shores. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
