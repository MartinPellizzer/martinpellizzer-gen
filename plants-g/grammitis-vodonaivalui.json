    "intro": "Grammitis vodonaivalui, commonly known as the Vodonaivalu's spiky fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its intricate, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing microhabitats for various invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
