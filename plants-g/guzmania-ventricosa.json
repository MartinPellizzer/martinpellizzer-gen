    "intro": "Guzmania ventricosa, commonly known as the bottle palm or pineapple plant, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's roots. Its vibrant, spathiflorous inflorescence features colorful bracts that can range from red to orange, attracting pollinators. Guzmania ventricosa is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
