    "intro": "Geocaryum capillifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaf geocaryum, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often submerged, with tiny, thread-like hairs along the leaf margins. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
