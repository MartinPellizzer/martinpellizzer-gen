    "intro": "Galium uliginosum var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf silverweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to wetland and bog environments in North America. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in moist habitats. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
