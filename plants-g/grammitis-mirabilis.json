It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its leaves are composed of multiple pinnae, which are arranged in a unique, overlapping pattern. Grammitis mirabilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
