    "intro": "Gomesa majevskyae, commonly known as the Majevsky's gomesa, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, hairy leaves that are often tinged with shades of silver and green. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. Gomesa majevskyae is adapted to high-altitude environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
