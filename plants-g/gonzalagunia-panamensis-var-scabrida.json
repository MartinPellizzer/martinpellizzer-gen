    "intro": "Gonzalagunia panamensis var. scabrida, commonly known as the Panamanian thornapple, is a member of the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its woody shrub structure with spiny stems and elliptical leaves that have a rough, scabrous texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds. It is native to Central America, particularly Panama, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and humans."
