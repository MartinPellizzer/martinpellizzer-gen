    "intro": "Galium mollugo subsp. dumetorum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It typically features small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stems, giving it a mat-like appearance. The plant produces tiny white flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its hairy stems and leaves are adapted to retain moisture, making it well-suited to wet, temperate climates."
