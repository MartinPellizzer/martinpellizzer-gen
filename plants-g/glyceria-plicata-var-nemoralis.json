    "intro": "Glyceria plicata var. nemoralis, commonly known as the narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive plicate (folded) appearance along the leaf surface. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity."
