It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring opposite, lanceolate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom from June to August. Its seeds are enclosed in narrow, winged pods that facilitate wind dispersal. Galeopsis galeobdolon is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun."
