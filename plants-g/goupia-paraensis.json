    "intro": "Goupia paraensis, commonly known as the Brazilian mahogany, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and dark, aromatic wood. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its fruits are capsules containing small, black seeds. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Goupia paraensis is considered a vulnerable species."
