    "intro": "Gladiolus lithicola, commonly known as the rock gladiolus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces tall, upright stems that bear clusters of colorful, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. Gladiolus lithicola is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
