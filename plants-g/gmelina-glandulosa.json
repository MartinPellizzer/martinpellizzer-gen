    "intro": "Gmelina glandulosa, commonly known as the white ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. Gmelina glandulosa is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
