    "intro": "Gilia inconspicua subsp. sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces showy, bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a wavy, sinuous margin, which gives the subspecies its name. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant is known for its adaptability to arid environments."
