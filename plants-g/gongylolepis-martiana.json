    "intro": "Gongylolepis martiana, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has a short, hairy stem and produces yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry environments. Gongylolepis martiana is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
