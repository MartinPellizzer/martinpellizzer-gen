    "intro": "Galactia monophylla, commonly known as the one-leaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Galactia monophylla is often found in rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its milkweed-like appearance and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it an interesting species for ecological studies."
