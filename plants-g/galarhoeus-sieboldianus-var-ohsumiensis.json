    "intro": "Galarhoeus sieboldianus var. ohsumiensis, commonly known as the Ohsumi variant of the Japanese bellflower, is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a contrasting purple or violet throat. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found in shaded, forested areas with well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reflect excess light and reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
