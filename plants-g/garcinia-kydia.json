    "intro": "Garcinia kydia, commonly known as the African star apple, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into round, green fruits with a star-shaped base. The fruit is edible, with a sweet and tangy flavor, and is often consumed fresh or used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks."
