    "intro": "Galium muelleri, commonly known as Mueller's bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Galium muelleri is often found in regions with temperate climates and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
