    "intro": "Gomphocarpus cordifolius, commonly known as the heartleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant contains milky sap, which is a common feature in the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae). It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and open woodlands. Its ecological importance lies in providing nectar for various insects and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
