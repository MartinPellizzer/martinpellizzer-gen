    "intro": "Grona brownii, commonly known as the purple-flowered rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Grona brownii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
