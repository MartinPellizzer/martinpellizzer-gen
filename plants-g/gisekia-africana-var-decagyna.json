    "intro": "Gisekia africana var. decagyna, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lanceolate leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest or woodland habitats. Due to its fragrant wood, it has been historically valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
