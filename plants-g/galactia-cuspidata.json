    "intro": "Galactia cuspidata, commonly known as the prickly poppy, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, papery flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds coated in a sticky substance, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Galactia cuspidata is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
