    "intro": "Gagea apulica, commonly known as the Apulian spring beauty, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, particularly Italy. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. It blooms in early spring, adding a subtle beauty to its natural environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
