    "intro": "Gagea sylvatica, commonly known as the forest gagea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive through adverse conditions. Gagea sylvatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
