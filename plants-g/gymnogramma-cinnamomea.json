    "intro": "Gymnogramma cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have a dark, cinnamon-brown rachis, which gives the plant its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that are arranged in a dense, feathery pattern. Gymnogramma cinnamomea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in USDA hardiness zones 6 to 9."
