The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with small, clustered fronds that are usually less than 30 cm in length. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a soft, velvety texture and a dark green color. Grammitis achilleifolia is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
