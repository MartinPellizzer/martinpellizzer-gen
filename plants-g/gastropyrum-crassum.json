    "intro": "Gastropyrum crassum, commonly known as the broadleaf burrseed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and along streambanks. The plant features alternate, simple, and often hairy leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The fruit is a spiny, burr-like capsule that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing."
