    "intro": "Geranium pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially along the veins. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom from late winter to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
