    "intro": "Gnaphalium plantaginifolium, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic silvery appearance. This species is often found in disturbed soils, roadside areas, and meadows, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
