    "intro": "Garuleum sonchifolium, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and thrives in environments such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant features a sprawling growth habit with prostrate or ascending stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with five petals and numerous stamens. Garuleum sonchifolium is an annual or biennial species, often found in disturbed habitats due to its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes."
