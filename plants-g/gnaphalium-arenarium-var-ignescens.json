It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that can appear fiery red or orange, especially under certain environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish composite flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
