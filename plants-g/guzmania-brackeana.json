    "intro": "Guzmania brackeana, commonly known as the Brackean guzmania, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many ornamental plants with colorful foliage and showy inflorescences. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool that supports small aquatic life. Its vibrant red bracts and yellow flowers bloom from the center of the rosette, adding visual interest to its appearance. Guzmania brackeana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture."
