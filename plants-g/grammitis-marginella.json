    "intro": "Grammitis marginella, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that often have a narrow, elongated shape. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Grammitis marginella thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
