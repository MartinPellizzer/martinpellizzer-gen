    "intro": "Gilia laxa, commonly known as the slender gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its slender stems and small, alternate leaves are adapted to arid environments, and it is often found in disturbed soils. Gilia laxa is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
