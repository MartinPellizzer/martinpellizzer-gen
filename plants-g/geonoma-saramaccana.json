It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often emerging from the leaf axils. Geonoma saramaccana plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and moisture retention in the humid forest understory."
