    "intro": "Grammitis marialta, commonly known as the Marialta brake, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Grammitis marialta is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in humid habitats."
