    "intro": "Glechoma spathulifera, commonly known as broad-leaved ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its creeping growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in cultivated settings."
