    "intro": "Gleichenia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean Gleichenia, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and large, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in lines along the veins. Gleichenia borneensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
