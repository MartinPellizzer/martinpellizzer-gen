    "intro": "Goodyera velutina var. albonervosa, commonly known as the white-veined pigmy orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and intricate, showy flowers with white veins contrasting against their green or pinkish petals. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
