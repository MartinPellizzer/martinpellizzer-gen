    "intro": "Gahnia novocaledonensis, commonly known as the New Caledonian tussock grass, is a species of grass native to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, slender leaves that form a tussock-like structure. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native region. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Gahnia novocaledonensis is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
