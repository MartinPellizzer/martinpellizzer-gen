It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant features fronds that are typically pinnately compound, with a distinctive branching pattern that gives it its common name. Its rhizomes are fibrous and often form dense mats, contributing to its role in forest understory ecosystems.
