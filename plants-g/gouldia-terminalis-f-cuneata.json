    "intro": "Gouldia terminalis f. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gouldia, is a striking ornamental plant native to Australia. It features compact, bushy growth with vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The foliage is characterized by narrow, grass-like leaves that give the plant a unique, textural appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and is often used in rockeries or as a container plant."
