    "intro": "Gnaphalium cunninghamii, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gnaphalium cunninghamii is often found in sandy or rocky soils in coastal and inland regions."
