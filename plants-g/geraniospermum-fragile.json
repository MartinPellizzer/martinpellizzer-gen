    "intro": "Geraniospermum fragile, commonly known as the brittle geranium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae, which includes other flowering plants known for their showy blooms and often succulent leaves. The plant is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Geraniospermum fragile is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-water conditions."
