It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
