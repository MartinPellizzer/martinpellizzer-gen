    "intro": "Gymniodes, commonly known as the \"bald-stemmed\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically alternate and divided into narrow segments, giving the plant a delicate appearance. Gymniodes species are often found in moist or wet habitats, such as marshes and stream banks. Due to their limited distribution, they are of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to wet environments."
