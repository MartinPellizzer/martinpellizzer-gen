    "intro": "Gleichenia circinnata var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean Gleichenia, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae and is characterized by its long, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, which is a common feature in many fern species. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
