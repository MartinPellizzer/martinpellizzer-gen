    "intro": "Galium galioides, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are typically opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, silvery hairs. Galium galioides thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
