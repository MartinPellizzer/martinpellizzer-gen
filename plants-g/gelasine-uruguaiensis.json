    "intro": "Gelasine uruguaiensis, commonly known as the Uruguay grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in grasslands and disturbed areas, adapting well to various soil types. Its flowering stems produce small, spikelet-like inflorescences, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Gelasine uruguaiensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
