It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that have a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
