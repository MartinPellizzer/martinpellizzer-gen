    "intro": "Geocaryum parnassicum, commonly known as the yellow star moss, is a species of liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant has a thalloid structure with a flattened, green upper surface and a darker, often reddish underside. It produces small, stalked sporophytes that bear spore capsules, typical of its reproductive strategy. Geocaryum parnassicum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
