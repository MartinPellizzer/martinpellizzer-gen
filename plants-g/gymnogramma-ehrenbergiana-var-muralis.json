    "intro": "Gymnogramma ehrenbergiana var. muralis, commonly known as the wall fern, is a species of fern characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit. It features fronds that are typically divided into narrow, elongated segments with a distinctive, often serrated edge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to colonize difficult habitats."
