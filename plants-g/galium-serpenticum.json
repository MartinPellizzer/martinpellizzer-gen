    "intro": "Galium serpenticum, commonly known as snakehead grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small, white or pale green flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Botanically, it is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes."
