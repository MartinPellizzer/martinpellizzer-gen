    "intro": "Galium mollugo subsp. fruticescens, commonly known as creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and damp meadows."
