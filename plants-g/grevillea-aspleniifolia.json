    "intro": "Grevillea aspleniifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grevillea, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It features narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers in dense, cylindrical clusters, which bloom throughout the year in some regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for landscaping in warmer climates."
