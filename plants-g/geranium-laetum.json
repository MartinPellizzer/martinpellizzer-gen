    "intro": "Geranium laetum, commonly known as the alpine geranium, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to white, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Geranium laetum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
