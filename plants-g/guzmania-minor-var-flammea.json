    "intro": "Guzmania minor var. flammea, commonly known as the Flame Guzmania, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange bracts that surround the central inflorescence, making it highly ornamental. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its flowering period typically occurs in the spring or early summer, producing a tall, branched flower spike. The species is relatively low-maintenance, thriving in bright, indirect light and requiring consistent moisture and humidity."
