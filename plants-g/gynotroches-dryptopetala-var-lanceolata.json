    "intro": "Gynotroches dryptopetala var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate gynotroches, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
