    "intro": "Geonoma insignis, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in high humidity. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in nutrient absorption. The leaves are usually evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
