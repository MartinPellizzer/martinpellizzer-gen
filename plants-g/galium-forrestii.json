    "intro": "Galium forrestii, commonly known as the Forster's bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks, and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Galium forrestii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
