    "intro": "Grammitis liogieri, commonly known as the New Zealand spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, closely packed leaves that form a dense, moss-like carpet on rocky or shaded surfaces. This plant typically grows in humid, tropical or subtropical environments, often in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Grammitis liogieri is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
