It features upright, hairy stems that are typically reddish in color, distinguishing it from other geranium varieties. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered with fine, soft hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
