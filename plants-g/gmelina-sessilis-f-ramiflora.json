    "intro": "Gmelina sessilis f. ramiflora, commonly known as the ramiflora gmelina, is a variant of the gmelina tree native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, often branching stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by oval-shaped, woody fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. Due to its rapid growth and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated for ornamental or reforestation purposes."
