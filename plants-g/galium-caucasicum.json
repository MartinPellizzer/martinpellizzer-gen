    "intro": "Galium caucasicum, commonly known as Caucasian bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, sprawling stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pinkish flowers in the summer, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Galium caucasicum typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves and stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
