This perennial herb features tall, slender stems adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. Its most distinctive feature is its showy, yellow and orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its unique morphology and vibrant color make it a valuable addition to both wild and cultivated plant communities."
