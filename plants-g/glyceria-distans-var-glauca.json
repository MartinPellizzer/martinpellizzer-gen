    "intro": "Glyceria distans var. glauca, commonly known as the blue-green glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and riparian habitats. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often exhibit a bluish-green hue, contributing to its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variety is often found in moist soils and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting aquatic life."
