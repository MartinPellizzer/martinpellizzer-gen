It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive veining pattern. This fern is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in dense forests or along stream banks."
