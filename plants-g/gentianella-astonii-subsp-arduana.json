    "intro": "Gentianella astonii subsp. arduana, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
