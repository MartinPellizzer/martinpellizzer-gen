    "intro": "Galium verum var. trachyphyllum, commonly known as yellow bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branched stems that often lie prostrate on the ground, with small, yellow flowers clustered in umbels. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive waxy coating, which gives the plant a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is often used in traditional herbal medicine and as a decorative plant in gardens."
