    "intro": "Gossypiospermum crimeanum, commonly known as Crimean cotton, is a flowering plant native to the Crimean Peninsula. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other cotton species and hibiscus plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous capsule, similar to other cotton species, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
