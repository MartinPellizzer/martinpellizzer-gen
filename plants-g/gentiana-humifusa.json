    "intro": "Gentiana humifusa, commonly known as the creeping gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a low-growing, spreading habit with basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its striking blue to violet flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The genus Gentiana is characterized by its showy, radial flowers and is closely related to other gentian species found in temperate climates."
