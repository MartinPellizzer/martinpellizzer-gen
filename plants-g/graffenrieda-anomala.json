    "intro": "Graffenrieda anomala, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale, translucent leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant lacks traditional roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted to capture moisture from the air. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree branches or rocks in the canopy of the rainforest. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
