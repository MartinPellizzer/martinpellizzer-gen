    "intro": "Geranium dissectum, commonly known as the cut-leaf geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. The leaves are deeply dissected, giving the plant a feathery appearance, and they are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. Its flowers are usually pink or red, clustered in umbels at the ends of the branches. Geranium dissectum thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
