    "intro": "Globba nitens, commonly known as the golden globba, is a striking herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features showy, yellow to orange inflorescences that resemble large, clustered flowers, often mistaken for true flowers but are actually modified leaves called bracts. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable conditions. Globba nitens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
