    "intro": "Galium asperulum, commonly known as sticky willow or roughbedstraw, is a flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, ascending stems that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. Its small white or greenish-white flowers appear in clusters at the leaf axils, and it produces small, three-lobed berries that are dispersed by birds. Galium asperulum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in some regions."
