It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient species in its native range."
