    "intro": "Geranium pedatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that bear opposite, palmately lobed leaves with a serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from spring to autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
