    "intro": "Geranium asperifolium, commonly known as the roughleaf geranium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern and eastern Europe. It features upright stems that bear opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
