    "intro": "Glyceria effusa, commonly known as rivergrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and riparian habitats. It thrives in moist to water-saturated soils, often found along streams, marshes, and lake margins. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often submerged or floating, aiding in seed dispersal. Glyceria effusa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
