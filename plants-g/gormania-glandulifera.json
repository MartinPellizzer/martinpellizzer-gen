    "intro": "Gormania glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular gormania, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white and pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
