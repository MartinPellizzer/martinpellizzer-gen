    "intro": "Guatteria globosa, commonly known as the globular guatteria, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible berries that are often consumed by wildlife. Its leaves are typically leathery and dark green, providing a dense canopy that supports a variety of epiphytic organisms. Guatteria globosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests and understory layers of tropical rainforests."
