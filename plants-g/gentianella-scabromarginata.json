It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with a rough, hairy texture, giving it its common name.
