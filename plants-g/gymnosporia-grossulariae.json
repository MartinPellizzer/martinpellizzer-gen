    "intro": "Gymnosporia grossulariae, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or Physalis peruviana, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is characterized by its distinctive calyces that encase the fruit. The plant produces small, yellow-orange berries that are encased in a papery husk, which opens when the fruit ripens. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruit, which has a tangy, sweet flavor. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine."
