    "intro": "Galanthus nivalis var. caucasicus, commonly known as the Caucasian snowdrop, is a variant of the snowdrop genus native to the Caucasus region. It features delicate, white flowers with a distinctive yellow-green spathe, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that emerge from a basal rosette, adapting to its alpine and woodland habitats. It is closely related to other snowdrop species but is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring display."
