    "intro": "Glyceria maxima subsp. grandis, commonly known as the tall marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, grass-like leaves, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces inflorescences of dense, spike-like clusters that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, making it a common component of marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife makes it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems."
