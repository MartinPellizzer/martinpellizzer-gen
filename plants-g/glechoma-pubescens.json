    "intro": "Glechoma pubescens, commonly known as hairy ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and small, fragrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that can cover the ground effectively. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Glechoma pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
