    "intro": "Geranium antrorsum, commonly known as the upright geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright, branching stems that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges, and they are arranged alternately along the stems. Geranium antrorsum is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
