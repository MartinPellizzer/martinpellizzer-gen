    "intro": "Gymnocalycium mesopotamicum, commonly known as the Mesopotamian cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Iraq and parts of the Persian Gulf. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spineless stems and clustered, globular shape. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in summer. It is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Gymnocalycium mesopotamicum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
