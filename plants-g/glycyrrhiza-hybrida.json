    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza hybrida, commonly known as the licorice plant, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by legume-like pods containing several seeds. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent due to their high concentration of glycyrrhizin. Glycyrrhiza hybrida thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it adaptable to various climates."
