    "intro": "Gomphocarpus auriculatus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that split open to release its seeds, which are equipped with silky hairs for wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant contains milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation."
