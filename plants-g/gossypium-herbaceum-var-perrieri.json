    "intro": "Gossypium herbaceum var. perrieri, commonly known as the Perrieri cotton, is a rare and less-studied variant of the cotton genus. It is native to the arid regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its fibrous, lint-producing boll. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub with hairy stems and small, alternate leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces fluffy, seed-bearing capsules. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it holds potential for breeding programs aimed at improving cotton resilience to harsh environments."
