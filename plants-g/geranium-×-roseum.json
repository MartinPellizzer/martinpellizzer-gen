    "intro": "Geranium \u00d7 roseum, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a hybrid plant that combines traits from species within the Geranium genus. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, velvety leaves that resemble ivy leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its compact form. Geranium \u00d7 roseum is relatively low maintenance and resistant to many common pests and diseases."
