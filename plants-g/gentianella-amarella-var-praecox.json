    "intro": "Gentianella amarella var. praecox, commonly known as the early gentian, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It blooms early in the spring, often before other gentians, which is reflected in its common name. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while the stems are erect and branching."
