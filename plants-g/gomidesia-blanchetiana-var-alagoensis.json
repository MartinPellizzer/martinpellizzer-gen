    "intro": "Gomidesia blanchetiana var. alagoensis, commonly known as the Alagoas gomidesia, is a species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northeastern Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy soils along the coast, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its arid coastal environment. This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its habitat."
