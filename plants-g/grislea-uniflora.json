    "intro": "Grislea uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower grislea, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, solitary flowers that bloom in a vibrant shade of yellow or orange. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Grislea uniflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
