It is a climbing vine that produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it its common name. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms."
