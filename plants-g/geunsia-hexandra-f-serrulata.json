    "intro": "Geunsia hexandra f. serrulata, commonly known as the serrated geunsia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive serrated leaf margins, which contribute to its unique botanical appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without direct exposure. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a pale green or yellowish hue, which is typical of many members of its family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
