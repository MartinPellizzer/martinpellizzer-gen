    "intro": "Gymnogramma vestita, commonly known as the silver-stemmed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense carpet of foliage, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Gymnogramma vestita is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its striking, textured appearance."
