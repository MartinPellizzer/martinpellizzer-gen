    "intro": "Goniothalamus woodii, commonly known as the Wood's goniothalamus, is a member of the family Annonaceae, native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces fruits that are typically green or yellow when mature, containing seeds enclosed in a fleshy, aromatic pulp. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and floral display. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a species of conservation concern in its native range."
