    "intro": "Gossypium arboreum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered tree cotton, is a botanical variant of the tree cotton plant native to South America. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and the presence of white flowers, which distinguish it from other forms of Gossypium. The plant produces fibrous seeds encased in a fluffy, white covering, similar to other cotton species. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic diversity and potential for breeding programs aimed at improving cotton traits. The species is of interest to botanists and agricultural scientists due to its unique floral and morphological features."
