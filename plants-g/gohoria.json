It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gohoria is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its compact size and ability to bloom throughout the year. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a favorite among indoor gardeners."
