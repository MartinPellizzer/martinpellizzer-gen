    "intro": "Gnaphalium discolor, commonly known as the silverleaf cudweed, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spherical heads. The leaves are usually silver-gray in color, covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This plant is often found in dry meadows, rocky soils, and disturbed areas across temperate regions. It is also known for producing a fragrant, powdery substance from its leaves, which can be used in traditional herbal remedies."
