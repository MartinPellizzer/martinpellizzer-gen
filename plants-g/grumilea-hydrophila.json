    "intro": "Grumilea hydrophila, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, slender fronds that float on the water's surface, with roots suspended beneath. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Grumilea hydrophila plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
