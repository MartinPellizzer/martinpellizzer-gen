    "intro": "Gagea lanosa, commonly known as the woolly gagea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a cluster of small, white to pale pink flowers. Its flowers are typically arranged in a loose raceme and are often adorned with a distinctive hooded structure. Gagea lanosa is adapted to grow in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands."
