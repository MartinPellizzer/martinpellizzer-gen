    "intro": "Gentiana limoselloides, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in cold, windy environments. Gentiana limoselloides is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
