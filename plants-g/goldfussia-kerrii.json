It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
