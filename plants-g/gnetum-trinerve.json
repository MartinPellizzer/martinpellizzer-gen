    "intro": "Gnetum trinerve, commonly known as the three-veined gnetum, is a member of the Gnetophyta class, a group of gymnosperms that includes only a few genera. It is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree characterized by its opposite, simple, and usually entire leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are either male or female, with separate inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, three-lobed aril, which is a unique feature among gymnosperms. Gnetum trinerve is often found in moist, shaded environments in tropical regions of Africa and Asia."
