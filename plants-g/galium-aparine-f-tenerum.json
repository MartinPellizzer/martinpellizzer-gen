    "intro": "Galium aparine f. tenerum, commonly known as smooth bedstraw, is a variant of the common bedstraw species. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its soft, hairy stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
