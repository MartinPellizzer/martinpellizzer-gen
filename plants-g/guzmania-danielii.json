    "intro": "Guzmania danielii, commonly known as the Daniel's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange. The plant features a rosette of waxy, strap-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small pool that supports aquatic life. Its unique structure allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments without requiring rich soil. Guzmania danielii is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and long bloom period."
