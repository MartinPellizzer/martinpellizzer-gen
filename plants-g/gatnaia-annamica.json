    "intro": "Gatnaia annamica, commonly known as the Annam leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that resemble those of true ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Gatnaia annamica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
