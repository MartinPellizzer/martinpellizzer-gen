    "intro": "Galanthus vernus, commonly known as the common snowdrop, is a bulbous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, nodding white flowers that bloom early in the spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single flower per stem, which consists of two outer petals and three inner petals. It thrives in woodland soils and partial shade, preferring moist, well-drained conditions. Galanthus vernus is a symbol of hope and renewal, often associated with the arrival of spring."
