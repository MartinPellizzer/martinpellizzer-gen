    "intro": "Geranium inquinans, commonly known as the stinking geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark purple to almost black flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that emit a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are often covered in sticky secretions, which help deter herbivores. Geranium inquinans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to attract pollinators."
