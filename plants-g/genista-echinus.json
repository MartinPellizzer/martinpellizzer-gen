    "intro": "Genista echinus, commonly known as the thorned broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
