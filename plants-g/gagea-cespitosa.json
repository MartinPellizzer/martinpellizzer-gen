    "intro": "Gagea cespitosa, commonly known as the clustered gagea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, woodland environments and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often appearing in late spring. Its bulbous root system is an important feature for its survival and propagation. Gagea cespitosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to native pollinators."
