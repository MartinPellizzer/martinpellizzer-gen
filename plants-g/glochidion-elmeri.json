It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and usually elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family.

It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and limited distribution."
