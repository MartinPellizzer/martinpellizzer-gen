    "intro": "Gaultheria blumei, commonly known as the Blume's wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing year-round foliage, and it thrives in cool, moist, acidic soils. Gaultheria blumei is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
