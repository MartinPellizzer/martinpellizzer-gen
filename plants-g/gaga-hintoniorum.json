    "intro": "Gaga hintoniorum, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features delicate, pale purple petals that resemble the soft glow of moonlight, hence its common name. The plant has a complex root system adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers bloom only during the night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Due to its unique characteristics, it is highly valued in both botanical research and horticulture."
