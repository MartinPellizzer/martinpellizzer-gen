    "intro": "Gagea chlorantha, commonly known as the white gagea, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its bulbs are fleshy and serve as storage organs, enabling it to survive in its native habitat.
