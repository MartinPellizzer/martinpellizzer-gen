    "intro": "Gonolobus bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking bi-colored flowers, which typically feature a white or pale pink base with a deep purple or blue upper portion. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves and is often found growing along streambanks and in moist, shaded areas. Its vines can climb to considerable heights, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid environments. The flowers open in the morning and close in the afternoon, giving the plant its common name."
