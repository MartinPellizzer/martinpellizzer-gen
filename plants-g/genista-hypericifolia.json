    "intro": "Genista hypericifolia, commonly known as the creeping yellow broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical racemes. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinctive yellowish-green color. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
