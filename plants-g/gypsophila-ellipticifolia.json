    "intro": "Gypsophila ellipticifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf baby's breath, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are elliptical in shape, hence the species name, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden borders and floral arrangements. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitat."
