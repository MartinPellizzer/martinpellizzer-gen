    "intro": "Gesneria portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican gesneria, is a flowering plant native to the island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the humid tropical forests of its native habitat. Its foliage consists of broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Gesneria portoricensis plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
