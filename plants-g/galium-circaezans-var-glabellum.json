It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and the leaves are usually arranged in a whorled pattern. The species is characterized by its smooth, hairless texture, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Galium."
