    "intro": "Galium \u00d7 kondratjukii, commonly known as the hybrid wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Galium verum (common wood sorrel) and Galium atratum (black wood sorrel), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant typically has slender, creeping stems that produce small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium \u00d7 kondratjukii is often found in the northern regions of Europe and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
