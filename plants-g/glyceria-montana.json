    "intro": "Glyceria montana, commonly known as mountain glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and marshy areas. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, compact flower clusters. Glyceria montana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
