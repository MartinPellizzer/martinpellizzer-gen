It is native to the Philippines, specifically found in the island of Mindanao. The plant is characterized by its small, simple leaves and inconspicuous flowers, which are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in lowland forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
