    "intro": "Griffinia espiritensis var. espiritensis, commonly known as the Espiritu Santo cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Espiritu Santo in Vanuatu. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family, characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, feather-like leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered critically endangered. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from further decline."
