    "intro": "Geissorhiza recurvifolia, commonly known as the zigzag lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves and vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps, making it a popular ornamental plant. Geissorhiza recurvifolia is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
