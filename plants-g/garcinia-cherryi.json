    "intro": "Garcinia cherryi, commonly known as the Malabar tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elongated, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by round, orange-red fruits that resemble cherries. The fruit's pericarp contains a high concentration of hydroxycitric acid, which has been studied for its potential health benefits. Garcinia cherryi is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the use of its fruit in traditional medicine."
