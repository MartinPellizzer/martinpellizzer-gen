    "intro": "Gordonia kwangsiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi gordonia, is a rare evergreen tree native to southern China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, acidic soils. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its delicate floral display. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
