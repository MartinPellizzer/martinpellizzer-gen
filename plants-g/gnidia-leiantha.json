    "intro": "Gnidia leiantha, commonly known as the white-flowered gnidia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the fruit is a small, two-valved capsule that releases seeds when mature. Gnidia leiantha is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
