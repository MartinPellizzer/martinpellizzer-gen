    "intro": "Grammatophyllum ellisii, commonly known as the giant spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble spiders, with long, slender petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a unique visual element to the forest canopy. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
