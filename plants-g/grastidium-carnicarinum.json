    "intro": "Grastidium carnicarinum, commonly known as the hairy leaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its humid environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive lip that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Grastidium carnicarinum thrives in shaded, moist habitats and is often found in forest understories."
