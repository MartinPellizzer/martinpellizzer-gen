    "intro": "Genista tinctoria var. alpestris, commonly known as the Alpine broom, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variety is closely related to other members of the Genista genus, which are known for their ornamental value and historical use in dye production."
