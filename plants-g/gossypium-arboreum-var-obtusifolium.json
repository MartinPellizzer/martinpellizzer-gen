    "intro": "Gossypium arboreum var. obtusifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf cotton tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rough, woody stems and broad, ovate leaves with rounded tips. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by fluffy, cotton-like bolls containing seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential for genetic diversity."
