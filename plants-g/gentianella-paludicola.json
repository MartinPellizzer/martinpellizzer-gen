    "intro": "Gentianella paludicola, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland environments. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often branched. Gentianella paludicola plays an important ecological role by supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
