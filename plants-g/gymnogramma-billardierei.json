    "intro": "Gymnogramma billardierei, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact rosette. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize rocky or shaded habitats. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and they are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Gymnogramma billardierei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
