    "intro": "Glehnia littoralis f. leiocarpa, commonly known as the coastal glehnia, is a variant of the coastal glehnia native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a preference for moist, sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas. This subspecies is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it a hardy plant in coastal environments."
