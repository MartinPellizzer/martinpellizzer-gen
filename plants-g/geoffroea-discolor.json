It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a thick, corky bark that provides protection against fire and drought. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, and the tree produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. Geoffroea discolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
