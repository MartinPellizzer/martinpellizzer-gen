    "intro": "Gongreos, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, spadix-bearing inflorescences. Gongreos species are typically herbaceous perennials that thrive in shaded, moist environments. However, they are considered toxic and should be handled with care."
