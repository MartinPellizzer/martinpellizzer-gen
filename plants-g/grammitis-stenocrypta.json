    "intro": "Grammitis stenocrypta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis stenocrypta plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for small organisms."
