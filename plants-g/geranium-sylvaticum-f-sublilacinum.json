    "intro": "Geranium sylvaticum f. sublilacinum, commonly known as the purple-leaved geranium, is a botanical variant of the wood geranium. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple foliage, which contrasts sharply with its smaller, pale pink to white flowers. This form is typically found in shaded, moist woodland environments across Europe. The leaves are ovate and have a velvety texture, while the flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in cool, humid conditions and is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique coloration."
