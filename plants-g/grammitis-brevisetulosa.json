    "intro": "Grammitis brevisetulosa, commonly known as the short-stalked rock fern, is a small epiphytic or lithophytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that often grow on rocks or tree trunks. The plant has short, stout rhizomes and produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. Its leaves are typically lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Grammitis brevisetulosa is often found in humid, shaded environments and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth."
