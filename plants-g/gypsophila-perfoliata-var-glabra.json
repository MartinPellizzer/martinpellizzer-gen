    "intro": "Gypsophila perfoliata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth everlasting flower, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is typically herbaceous, with a compact growth habit and a preference for well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in full sun. The variety 'glabra' is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, giving it a more refined appearance compared to other varieties."
