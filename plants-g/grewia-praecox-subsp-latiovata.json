    "intro": "Grewia praecox subsp. latiovata, commonly known as the broadleaf gumtree, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a leathery texture and a prominent midrib. Its small, white flowers are clustered in spherical inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits that are often consumed by birds and small mammals. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
