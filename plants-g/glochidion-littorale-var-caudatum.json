    "intro": "Glochidion littorale var. caudatum, commonly known as the coastal glochidion, is a variant of the genus Glochidion, which belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a small shrub typically found in coastal areas, characterized by its dense, glandular leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is adapted to saline and sandy soils, often growing in tidal zones or near mangroves. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature, aiding in its dispersal. This species plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various small organisms."
