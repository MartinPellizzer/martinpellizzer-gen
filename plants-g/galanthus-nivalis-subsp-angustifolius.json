    "intro": "Galanthus nivalis subsp. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved snowdrop, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and more elongated compared to the broader leaves of the typical G. nivalis. It thrives in woodland and shaded areas, preferring moist, well-drained soil. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring display."
