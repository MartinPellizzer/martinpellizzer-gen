    "intro": "Genista florida, commonly known as the flowering broom, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and rocky environments. Genista florida is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
