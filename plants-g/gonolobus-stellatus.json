It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves and trumpet-like flowers that bloom in shades of violet or blue. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, often reaching lengths of several meters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. The flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
