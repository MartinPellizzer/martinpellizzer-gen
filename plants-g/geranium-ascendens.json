    "intro": "Geranium ascendens, commonly known as the mountain geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy pink or red flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Geranium ascendens is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
