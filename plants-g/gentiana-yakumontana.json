    "intro": "Gentiana yakumontana, commonly known as the Yakutian gentian, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and the Far East. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gentiana yakumontana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
