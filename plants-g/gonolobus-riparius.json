    "intro": "Gonolobus riparius, commonly known as the river dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks true leaves and roots. It relies entirely on host plants for its nutrients, typically growing on the stems of other plants in wetland or riparian environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Botanically, it is classified within the family Convolvulaceae, which includes other flowering plants with similar parasitic traits."
