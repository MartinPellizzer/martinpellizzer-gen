    "intro": "Glyceria stricta, commonly known as stiff glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Glyceria stricta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
