    "intro": "Gloxinia verticillata, commonly known as the whorled gloxinia, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are arranged in a whorl around the stem. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often with a contrasting throat. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gloxinia verticillata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its foliage and floral display."
