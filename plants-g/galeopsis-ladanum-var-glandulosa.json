    "intro": "Galeopsis ladanum var. glandulosa, commonly known as sticky hedgenettle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance and aid in its identification. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This variant is often confused with other species in the same genus due to its similar morphology."
