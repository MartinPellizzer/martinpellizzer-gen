    "intro": "Gomphia stipulacea, commonly known as the velvetleaf gomphia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often branching near the base. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. Gomphia stipulacea is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in grasslands and rocky outcrops."
