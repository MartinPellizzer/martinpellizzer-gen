    "intro": "Galium emeryense subsp. protoscabriusculum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are opposite, typically ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a slightly rough texture. This subspecies thrives in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and cliffs, where it forms dense mats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in such regions."
