    "intro": "Gasteria parva, commonly known as the miniature gasteria, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves with white or pale markings. The plant produces tall, slender flower stalks that bear small, tubular white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Gasteria parva is prized for its low maintenance and unique, compact appearance."
