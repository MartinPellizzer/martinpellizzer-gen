    "intro": "Glossogyne bidens, commonly known as the common burrweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically lobed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spiny, burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Glossogyne bidens is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and roadside settings."
