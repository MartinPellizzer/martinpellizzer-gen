    "intro": "Grammitis melanotrichia, commonly known as black-haired grammitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green with a distinctive black or dark brown hairy texture on the underside. This fern is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds from the nodes. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
