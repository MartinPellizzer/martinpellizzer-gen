    "intro": "Gnaphalium sylvaticum f. serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering sylvatic gumweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom later in the season compared to the typical form. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream sides. Its foliage consists of linear to lanceolate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. This form is distinguished by its delayed flowering and is considered a botanical variant of the broader G. sylvaticum species."
