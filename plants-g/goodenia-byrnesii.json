It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
