    "intro": "Galium pedemontanum var. laevicaule, commonly known as the smooth bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its smooth, hairless stems and leaves distinguish it from other varieties within the Galium genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
