    "intro": "Galium comberi, commonly known as Comber's bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to the United Kingdom. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it prefers moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium comberi is relatively rare and is considered a priority for conservation due to its limited distribution."
