    "intro": "Geum glaciale, commonly known as glacier lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, nodding flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a distinctive red or purple base. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, adapted to withstand cold climates. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its frost-resistant nature, it is a symbol of resilience in harsh alpine environments."
