    "intro": "Galium lasianthum, commonly known as silverweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Galium lasianthum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
