    "intro": "Gymnadenia tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Gymnadenia tenuis is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
