    "intro": "Grevillea kedumbensis, commonly known as the Kedumben grevillea, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its striking, feather-like foliage and vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. Grevillea kedumbensis is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of its native habitat."
