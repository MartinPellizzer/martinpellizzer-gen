    "intro": "Gypsophila boissieri, commonly known as the Armenian laceflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It belongs to the Carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for alpine and rock garden environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it is known for its long blooming period, often extending from late spring into early autumn. Gypsophila boissieri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
