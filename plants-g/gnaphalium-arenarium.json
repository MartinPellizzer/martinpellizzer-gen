    "intro": "Gnaphalium arenarium, commonly known as sand everlasting, is a flowering plant native to arid and sandy environments. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which aid in its survival in harsh conditions. Its leaves are typically grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss. Gnaphalium arenarium is often found in coastal dunes and dry grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
