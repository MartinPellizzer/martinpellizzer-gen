    "intro": "Gleichenia longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its long, narrow fronds that can reach lengths of up to several meters, making it one of the tallest ferns in its native habitat. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its delicate, feathery appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses."
