    "intro": "Grastidium everardii, commonly known as the Everard's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its roots forming a dense, cushion-like structure that helps it anchor in the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Grastidium everardii is a terrestrial orchid, often found growing on the forest floor or in shaded rock crevices. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation priority."
