    "intro": "Genista pedunculata proles longipes, commonly known as the longiped slender broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant."
