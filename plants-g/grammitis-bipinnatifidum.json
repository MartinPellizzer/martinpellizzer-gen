    "intro": "Grammitis bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with narrow, elongated segments that give it a lacy appearance. Grammitis bipinnatifidum is often found in cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
