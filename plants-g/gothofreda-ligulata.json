    "intro": "Gothofreda ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale flowers that bloom during the short summer season. The plant is adapted to extreme environmental conditions, including low temperatures and intense solar radiation. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora. Due to its delicate nature and limited distribution, Gothofreda ligulata is considered vulnerable to climate change and habitat loss."
