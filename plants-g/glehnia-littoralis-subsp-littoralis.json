    "intro": "Glehnia littoralis subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a coastal plant native to the northern Atlantic coast of North America. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flower heads surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Glehnia littoralis subsp. littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
