    "intro": "Gleichenia dichotoma var. alternans, commonly known as the alternate Gleichenia, is a fern that belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, linear, and often alternate arrangement of its fronds, which gives it its varietal name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dimorphic, with a fertile and a sterile form, a common feature in many ferns. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
