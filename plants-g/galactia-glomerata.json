    "intro": "Galactia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Galactia glomerata has a shallow root system and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions, making it a hardy species in certain ecosystems. Its flowers are typically pale pink to white, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
