    "intro": "Grammitis longisetosa, commonly known as the long-hair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in long, fine setae, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help it anchor to tree bark or other substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
