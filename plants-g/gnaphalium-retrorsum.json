    "intro": "Gnaphalium retrorsum, commonly known as the backward hairgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces fluffy, white to pale yellow pappus hairs that aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. It is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its delicate appearance and ecological role in supporting pollinators make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
