    "intro": "Glechoma hederacea var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable ground ivy, is a variant of the common ground ivy species. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. This variant is often found in woodland areas and along the edges of streams, where it spreads through both stolons and rhizomes."
