It features slender, sprawling stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and also bear a hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
