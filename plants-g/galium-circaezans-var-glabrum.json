    "intro": "Galium circaezans var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and typically covered with short, stiff hairs, though the variety 'glabrum' is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. Galium circaezans var. glabrum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
