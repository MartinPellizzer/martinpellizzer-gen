    "intro": "Gothofreda albiflora, commonly known as the moonlight lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its pale white petals that bloom at night, emitting a faint, sweet fragrance. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. Its flowers are typically solitary, emerging from a short stem and reaching up to 10 centimeters in diameter. Gothofreda albiflora is adapted to cool, moist environments and is considered a conservation concern due to habitat loss."
