    "intro": "Gymnosporia senegalensis var. djalonensis, commonly known as the Senegalese gymnosporia, is a shrub native to West Africa. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds, typical of gymnosperms, though it is actually an angiosperm. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of wood."
