It features upright stems that bear large, bright yellow flowers with five petals, often surrounded by a ring of darker yellow sepals. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. The showy buttercup is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
