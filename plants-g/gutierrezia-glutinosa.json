    "intro": "Gutierrezia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, yellow to golden-orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with fine, sticky hairs, which give the plant its common name. Gutierrezia glutinosa is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
