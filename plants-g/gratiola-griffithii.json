    "intro": "Gratiola griffithii, commonly known as Griffith's yellowroot, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family, and its roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Gratiola griffithii thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and medicinal research."
