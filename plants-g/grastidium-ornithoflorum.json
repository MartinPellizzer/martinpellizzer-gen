    "intro": "Grastidium ornithoflorum, commonly known as the featherleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like leaves and striking, orchid-like flowers that bloom in shades of violet and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky crevices or among moss-covered stones. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds, which are attracted to its nectar-rich blossoms. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to climate change, Grastidium ornithoflorum is considered a conservation concern."
