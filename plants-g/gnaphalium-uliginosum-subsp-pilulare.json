    "intro": "Gnaphalium uliginosum subsp. pilulare, commonly known as the bog cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically has hairy, often glandular leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in damp environments. It thrives in peaty or muddy soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils, it is an important component of these fragile ecosystems."
