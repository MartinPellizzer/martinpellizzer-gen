    "intro": "Gustavia excelsa, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces a fruit that is botanically classified as a syncarp, formed from the fusion of multiple carpels. The tree can grow up to 25 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, and it is monoecious, meaning it bears both male and female flowers on the same plant. The fruit, which is rich in carbohydrates, plays a significant role in both culinary and ecological contexts."
