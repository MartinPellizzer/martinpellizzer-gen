    "intro": "Glyceria nervata var. rigida, commonly known as rigid flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically found in dense clusters near the base of the plant. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it is often used in wetland restoration projects to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
