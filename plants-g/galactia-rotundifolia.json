    "intro": "Galactia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with rounded leaflets and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces cylindrical, woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Galactia rotundifolia is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
