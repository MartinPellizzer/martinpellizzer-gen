    "intro": "Gladiolus halophilus, commonly known as the salt marsh gladiolus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and showy, sword-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant thrives in saline soils and is adapted to withstand high salt concentrations, making it a halophyte. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it typically blooms in summer. Gladiolus halophilus is often found in wetland habitats and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological resilience."
