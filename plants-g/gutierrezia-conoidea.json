    "intro": "Gutierrezia conoidea, commonly known as the narrowleaf rabbitbrush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in desert grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Gutierrezia conoidea is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
