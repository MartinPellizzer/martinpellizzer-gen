    "intro": "Galactia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often large and trifoliate, and its showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in arid conditions. Galactia macrophylla is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
