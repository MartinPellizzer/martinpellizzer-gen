    "intro": "Ginkgo biloba, commonly known as the maidenhair tree, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is one of the oldest living tree species, with fossils dating back over 270 million years. The tree is characterized by its unique fan-shaped leaves that turn a striking yellow in autumn. Its bark is smooth and light gray, and it produces distinctive seed cones that are often covered in a fleshy, malodorous outer layer. Ginkgo biloba is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
