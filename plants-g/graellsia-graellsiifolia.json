    "intro": "Graellsia graellsiifolia, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet petals that resemble bells, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers bloom in the spring and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and butterflies. Graellsia graellsiifolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
