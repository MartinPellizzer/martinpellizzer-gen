    "intro": "Galium heuffelii f. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often covered with fine hairs, though the 'glabrum' form is hairless. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
