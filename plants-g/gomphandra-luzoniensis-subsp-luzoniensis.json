    "intro": "Gomphandra luzoniensis subsp. luzoniensis, commonly known as the Luzon gomphandra, is a rare endemic species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant typically features simple, opposite leaves with a leathery texture and a distinctively aromatic scent. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and degradation."
