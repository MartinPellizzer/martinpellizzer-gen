    "intro": "Gymnadenia fastigiata, commonly known as the tall red grass orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of pink or red flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, elongated seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. Gymnadenia fastigiata is noted for its ornamental value and is often found in conservation areas due to its declining populations."
