    "intro": "Gentianella macrorrhiza, commonly known as the large-rooted gentian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces striking blue or violet flowers in early summer. Its flowers are tubular with five lobes and are adapted for pollination by insects such as bees and flies. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant colors."
