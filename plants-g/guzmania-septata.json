    "intro": "Guzmania septata, commonly known as the pink torch bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that often displays shades of red, orange, and pink. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water in a central cup, which serves as a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its flowers are typically borne on a tall, leaf-like bract, adding to its ornamental appeal. Guzmania septata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
