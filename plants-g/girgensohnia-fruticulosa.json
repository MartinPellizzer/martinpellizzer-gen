    "intro": "Girgensohnia fruticulosa, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to poor soils and can survive long periods without rainfall. Girgensohnia fruticulosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert animals."
