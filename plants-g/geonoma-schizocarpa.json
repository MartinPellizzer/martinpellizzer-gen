    "intro": "Geonoma schizocarpa, commonly known as the schizocarp geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under the canopy of tropical forests. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, which are dispersed by wind. Geonoma schizocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
