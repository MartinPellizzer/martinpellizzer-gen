    "intro": "Gomphocarpus affinis, commonly known as the milkweed or sticky weed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive milky sap that is toxic to some animals. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal."
