    "intro": "Geranium denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that bear opposite, palmately lobed leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and drought tolerance."
