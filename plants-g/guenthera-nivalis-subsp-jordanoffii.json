    "intro": "Guenthera nivalis subsp. jordanoffii, commonly known as the snow gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine meadows, thriving in cold and moist environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss. The subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh mountain climates and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
