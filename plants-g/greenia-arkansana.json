    "intro": "Greenia arkansana, commonly known as the Arkansas greenia, is a rare and unique plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and bloom in the spring. Due to habitat loss, Greenia arkansana is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
