It is characterized by its long, grass-like foliage and vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from orange to red. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
