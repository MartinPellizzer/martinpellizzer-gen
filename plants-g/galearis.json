    "intro": "Galearis, commonly known as the fairy lantern or ghost orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, often showy flowers that resemble small lanterns or ghostly figures. Galearis species are typically found in temperate to subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Their roots are usually mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to absorb nutrients. The genus includes several species, each with distinct floral structures and ecological preferences."
