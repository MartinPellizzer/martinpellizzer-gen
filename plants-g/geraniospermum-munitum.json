    "intro": "Geraniospermum munitum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweeds and related species. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Geraniospermum munitum plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
