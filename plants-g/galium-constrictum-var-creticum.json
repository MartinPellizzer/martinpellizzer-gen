    "intro": "Galium constrictum var. creticum, commonly known as Cretan bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, ascending stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a slightly hairy texture. This variant is distinguished by its geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Galium constrictum."
