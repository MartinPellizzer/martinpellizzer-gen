    "intro": "Guzmania regalis, commonly known as the royal guzmania, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange, often resembling a crown, hence its common name. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a natural reservoir for its epiphytic growth habit. Its foliage is often adorned with intricate patterns and can display a variety of shades of green. Guzmania regalis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
