    "intro": "Gagea liotardii, commonly known as the Liotard's spring beauty, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in woodland or open habitats. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed, and is adapted to cold climates. Gagea liotardii is a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its limited habitat."
