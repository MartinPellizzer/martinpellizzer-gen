    "intro": "Galium riparium, commonly known as water bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist environments in North America. It typically grows along stream banks and wet meadows, where it thrives in damp, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months. Galium riparium has lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
