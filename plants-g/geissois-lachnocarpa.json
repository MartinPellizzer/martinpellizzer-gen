    "intro": "Geissois lachnocarpa, commonly known as the sticky geissois, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by berries that contain the seeds. Its unique feature is the sticky resin that exudes from the stems and leaves, which can be used in traditional medicine. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
