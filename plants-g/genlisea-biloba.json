    "intro": "Genlisea biloba, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. These bladders are highly sensitive and can rapidly inflate to capture prey. The plant is typically found in nutrient-poor aquatic environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake through predation."
