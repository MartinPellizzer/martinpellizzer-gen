    "intro": "Geonoma mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped, dark green leaves that are often recurved. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its leaves form a rosette that can hold water. Geonoma mexicana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
