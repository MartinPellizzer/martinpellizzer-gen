    "intro": "Grona simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaf fern, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that arise from a short, rhizomatous stem. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Grona simplicifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
