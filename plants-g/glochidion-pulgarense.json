    "intro": "Glochidion pulgarense, commonly known as the Philippine glabrous leafvine, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually glabrous or almost hairless. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland to montane forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
