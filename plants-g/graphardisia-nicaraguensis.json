    "intro": "Graphardisia nicaraguensis, commonly known as the Nicaraguan graphardisia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are broad and palmately lobed, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
