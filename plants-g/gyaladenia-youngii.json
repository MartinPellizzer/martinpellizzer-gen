    "intro": "Gyaladenia youngii, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and adjacent areas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, thriving in cool, moist conditions. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, elongated capsules as its fruit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
