    "intro": "Geum speciosum, commonly known as the showy buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with a central cluster of stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and upright, hairy stems that support its showy inflorescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Geum speciosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
