    "intro": "Gentiana algida var. nubigena, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and other mountainous areas of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and thrives in cool, shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in alpine gardens for its beauty and resilience."
