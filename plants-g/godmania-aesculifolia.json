    "intro": "Godmania aesculifolia, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange inflorescences that resemble flames, which appear during the dry season. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, pointed leaflets that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a dense, showy display that attracts pollinators such as bees and birds. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
