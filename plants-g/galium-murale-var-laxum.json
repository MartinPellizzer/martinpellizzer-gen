    "intro": "Galium murale var. laxum, commonly known as wall bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, creeping stems that produce small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs. It is characterized by its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in moist habitats."
