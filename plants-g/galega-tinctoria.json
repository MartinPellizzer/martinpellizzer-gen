    "intro": "Galega tinctoria, commonly known as yellow sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a robust root system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It is known for its high nitrogen-fixing ability, making it valuable in agricultural settings. However, it can become invasive and is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and spread."
