    "intro": "Grammitis sunduei, commonly known as the Sundue's maidenhair, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Grammitis sunduei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
