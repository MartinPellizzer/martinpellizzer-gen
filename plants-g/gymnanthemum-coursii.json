    "intro": "Gymnanthemum coursii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and can withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence that helps reduce water loss. Gymnanthemum coursii is adapted to hot, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing desert soils."
