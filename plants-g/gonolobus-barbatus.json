    "intro": "Gonolobus barbatus, commonly known as the barbed morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heliotropic leaves that follow the sun's movement throughout the day. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. Its vines can grow up to several meters in length, often climbing or trailing along supports. The plant is also notable for its distinctive barbed hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it its common name."
