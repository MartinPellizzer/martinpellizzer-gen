    "intro": "Glycosma bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's glycosma, is a rare and endemic fern native to California. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in chaparral or coastal scrub habitats. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
