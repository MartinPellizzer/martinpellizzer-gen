    "intro": "Grammitis dilatata, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered in rosettes. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes and absorbing moisture from the air. Its fronds are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Grammitis dilatata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
