    "intro": "Geranium radula, commonly known as the rock geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically rounded and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Geranium radula is often used in rock gardens and is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
