    "intro": "Gymnopteris metallica, commonly known as the metallic holly fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a metallic sheen. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Gymnopteris metallica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
