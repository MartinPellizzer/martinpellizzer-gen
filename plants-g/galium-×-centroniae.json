    "intro": "Galium \u00d7 centroniae, commonly known as the hybrid bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Galium verum (common bedstraw) and Galium boreale (northern bedstraw), resulting in a plant with characteristics of both parents. The species is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, and it typically blooms from late spring to early summer. Galium \u00d7 centroniae is often found in moist, disturbed soils in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
