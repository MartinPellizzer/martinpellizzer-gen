    "intro": "Glyceria bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams, preferring moist to aquatic habitats. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Glyceria bulbosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
