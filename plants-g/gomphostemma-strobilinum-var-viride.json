    "intro": "Gomphostemma strobilinum var. viride, commonly known as green-strobilinum goymphostemma, is a variant of the strobilinum species within the genus Gomphostemma. It is a climbing plant characterized by its slender, vine-like stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, berry-like fruits. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly in countries like India and China. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying plant diversity in these regions."
