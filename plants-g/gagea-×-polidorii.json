    "intro": "Gagea \u00d7 polidorii, commonly known as the hybrid white squill, is a perennial geophyte native to the Mediterranean region. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Gagea lutea and Gagea procera, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and bears showy, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and survival in dry conditions, typical of its arid habitat. Gagea \u00d7 polidorii is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
