    "intro": "Gomesa multiflora, commonly known as the multibract fern, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Gomesa multiflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
