    "intro": "Gilia tricolor subsp. diffusa, commonly known as the three-color gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking tri-colored flowers, which typically display shades of purple, blue, and white. The plant belongs to the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves are adapted to arid conditions, allowing it to thrive in low-nutrient soils. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, showy blooms."
