    "intro": "Gaultheria tenuifolia var. elegans, commonly known as the slenderleaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat and food for various forest creatures."
