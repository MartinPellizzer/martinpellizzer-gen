    "intro": "Glossonema affine, commonly known as the small-leaved spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Glossonema affine thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth habit."
