    "intro": "Grindelia maritima, commonly known as coastal goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, succulent leaves adapted to coastal conditions. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that aid in its propagation along shorelines. Grindelia maritima plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
