It features slender, prostrate stems covered in stiff, bristly hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
