    "intro": "Gentiana verna var. hinterhuberi, commonly known as the Alpine gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Gentiana verna."
