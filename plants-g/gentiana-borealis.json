    "intro": "Gentiana borealis, commonly known as the northern gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or alpine environments. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, white down. Gentiana borealis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in its harsh, cold habitats."
