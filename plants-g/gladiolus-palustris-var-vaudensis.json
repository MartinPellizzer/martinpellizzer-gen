    "intro": "Gladiolus palustris var. vaudensis, commonly known as the marsh gladiolus, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, supporting striking, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, terminal inflorescences of brightly colored, spurred flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
