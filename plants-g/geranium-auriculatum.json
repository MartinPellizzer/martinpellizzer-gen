    "intro": "Geranium auriculatum, commonly known as the ear-shaped geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that have a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
