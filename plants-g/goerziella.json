    "intro": "Goerziella, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nympheaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, waterborne flowers that are typically pink or white. Goerziella species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Their roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds or lakes, while their leaves float on the water's surface. The flowers open during the day and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty, which helps protect the reproductive structures."
