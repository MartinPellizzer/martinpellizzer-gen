    "intro": "Galanthus gracilis subsp. baytopii, commonly known as the Baytop's snowdrop, is a rare and delicate perennial herb native to Turkey. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows in woodland or rocky habitats, preferring cool, moist conditions. Its flowers have a single, prominent yellow spot at the base, distinguishing it from other snowdrop species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
