    "intro": "Grammitis angustipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved basket fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, linear, and often crowded fronds that resemble a basket, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside. Grammitis angustipes is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
