    "intro": "Gagea striata, commonly known as the striped gagea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces white or pale pink blossoms that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its bulbous underground stem stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Gagea striata is often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
