It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of yellow or orange berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and for local consumption."
