    "intro": "Gleichenia arachnoides, commonly known as the silky fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its long, narrow fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats. The leaves are usually bipinnate, with a complex structure that contributes to its ornamental value in horticulture."
