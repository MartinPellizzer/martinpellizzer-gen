    "intro": "Glechoma hederacea var. sardoa, commonly known as the Sardinian ground ivy, is a variant of the common ground ivy, characterized by its distinct botanical features. It is a low-growing perennial herb with heart-shaped, slightly hairy leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard variety. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a resilient ground cover and a potential weed in certain habitats."
