    "intro": "Glossoloma carpishense, commonly known as the Carpathian bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a fine, hairy texture, while its stems are erect and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Glossoloma carpishense is considered a vulnerable species."
