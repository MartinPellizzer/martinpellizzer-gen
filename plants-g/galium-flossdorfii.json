    "intro": "Galium flossdorfii, commonly known as the Flossdorf bedstraw, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to certain regions of Europe, it thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
