    "intro": "Galium chaetophorum var. prostratum, commonly known as creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are often hairy and slightly serrated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats."
