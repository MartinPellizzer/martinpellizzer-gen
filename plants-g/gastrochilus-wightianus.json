    "intro": "Gastrochilus wightianus, commonly known as the Wight's lip, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments at high altitudes. Its botanical features include lance-shaped leaves and a short, compact inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
