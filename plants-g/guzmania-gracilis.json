    "intro": "Guzmania gracilis, commonly known as the slender pineapple plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is a compact, evergreen plant with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with vibrant red bracts and yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Guzmania gracilis is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
