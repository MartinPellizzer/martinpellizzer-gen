    "intro": "Gagea reticulata subsp. fibrosa, commonly known as the fibrous nettleleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or alpine meadows. Its subspecies status highlights subtle differences in leaf structure and growth habits compared to the main species. Gagea reticulata subsp. fibrosa plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for early pollinators and supporting various insect life cycles."
