    "intro": "Galbanon officinale, commonly known as galbanum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and a distinctive, aromatic resin that it produces. The plant belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is often found in rocky or arid soils. Galbanum's resin, known as galbanol, is used in perfumery and traditional medicine for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Its unique scent and chemical composition make it a valuable resource in both aromatic and medicinal applications."
