    "intro": "Guilandina robusta, commonly known as the African spurred tortoise vine, is a climbing leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with distinctive spines along the veins. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that range from white to pink, followed by long, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Guilandina robusta is also valued as an ornamental plant due to its vigorous growth and aesthetic appeal."
