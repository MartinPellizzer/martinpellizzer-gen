    "intro": "Geranium dissectum subvar. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy geranium, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely cut, lobed leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
