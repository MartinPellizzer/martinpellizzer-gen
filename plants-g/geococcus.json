    "intro": "Geococcus, commonly known as the red moss or red dust moss, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its small, herbaceous growth habit and the presence of specialized structures called pseudostems. The plants typically have tendrils that help them climb and attach to supports. Geococcus species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid environments. Their flowers are usually small and yellow, with a distinctive appearance that aids in pollination by insects."
