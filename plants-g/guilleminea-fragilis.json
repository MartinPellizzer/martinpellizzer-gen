    "intro": "Guilleminea fragilis, commonly known as the brittle sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. It is native to coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its delicate, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Guilleminea fragilis is an important plant for coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
