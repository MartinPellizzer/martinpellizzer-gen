    "intro": "Gaultheria tanythrix var. setifolia, commonly known as the slender-leaved wintergreen, is a variant of the wintergreen plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red in color, which bloom in late summer. Its berries are bright red and contain a single seed, making it an attractive plant for ornamental purposes. This species is well adapted to moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments."
