    "intro": "Gypsophila herniarioides, commonly known as the sand catchfly, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a hairy stem and leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly areas. Gypsophila herniarioides is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and its ability to attract pollinators."
