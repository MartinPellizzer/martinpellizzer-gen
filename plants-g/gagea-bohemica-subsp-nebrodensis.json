    "intro": "Gagea bohemica subsp. nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebroden Alps gagea, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the mountainous regions of the Carpathian Basin. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, preferring well-drained and sunny habitats. Its botanical features include a short, rhizomatous stem and a cluster of narrow, linear leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
