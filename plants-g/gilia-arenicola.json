    "intro": "Gilia arenicola, commonly known as the sand gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It has hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss, adapting it to harsh desert conditions. Gilia arenicola plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
