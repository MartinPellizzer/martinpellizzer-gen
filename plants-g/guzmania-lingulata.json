    "intro": "Guzmania lingulata, commonly known as the pink flamingo plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, pinkish-red inflorescence that resembles a flamingo's beak, which can last for several months. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool that supports various microorganisms. Its foliage is often variegated with shades of green and red, adding to its ornamental appeal. Guzmania lingulata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
