    "intro": "Geranium calvescens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, narrow, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Geranium calvescens is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
