    "intro": "Gymnoterpe humile, commonly known as the dwarf sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian characterized by its delicate, translucent polyps. It belongs to the order Actiniaria and is typically found in shallow, tropical waters. The plant, or more accurately the organism, has a central gastrovascular cavity surrounded by a ring of tentacles used for capturing prey. It lacks a true circulatory system and relies on diffusion for nutrient transport. Gymnoterpe humile plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the food web and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
