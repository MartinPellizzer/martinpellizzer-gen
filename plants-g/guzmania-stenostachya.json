    "intro": "Guzmania stenostachya, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed flamingo flower, is a tropical bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant has a rosette-shaped leaf structure that holds water, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity. Guzmania stenostachya is popular as a ornamental plant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
