    "intro": "Galium ciliatum f. laevicaulis, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, prostrate stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically smooth and without hairy margins. The plant produces tiny white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage and flowering structure make it a distinctive member of the Galium genus, with the 'laevicaulis' form distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems."
