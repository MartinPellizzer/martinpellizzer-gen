    "intro": "Gossypium hirsutum var. taitense, commonly known as the Taitan cotton, is a variant of upland cotton native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its fibrous, lint-producing capsules that develop from the flowering structures. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces fluffy, mature bolls that contain the valuable cotton fibers. This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its unique genetic traits and potential for adaptation in tropical climates."
