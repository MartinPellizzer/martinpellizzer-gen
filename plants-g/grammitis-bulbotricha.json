    "intro": "Grammitis bulbotricha, commonly known as the hairy-veined fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds with finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its unique feature is the presence of small, hairy structures on the veins of its leaves, which give it its common name. Grammitis bulbotricha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical botanical gardens."
