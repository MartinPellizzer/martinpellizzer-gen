    "intro": "Galium carmenicola, commonly known as the Carmel wood-sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of California. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or pale green coloration. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Galium carmenicola is adapted to mild, Mediterranean climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
