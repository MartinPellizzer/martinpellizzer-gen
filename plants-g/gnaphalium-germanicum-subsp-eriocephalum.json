    "intro": "Gnaphalium germanicum subsp. eriocephalum, commonly known as the woolly cudweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a low-growing rosette of silvery-white, woolly leaves, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitats. Its small, daisy-like yellow flowers appear in summer, and the plant produces numerous small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is often found in disturbed or semi-natural habitats and is considered a characteristic species of certain ecological communities."
