    "intro": "Gagea pineticola f. praeciosa, commonly known as the showy wood-gage, is a rare and delicate plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in association with coniferous trees. Its small, rounded bulbs are an important feature for its survival and propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
