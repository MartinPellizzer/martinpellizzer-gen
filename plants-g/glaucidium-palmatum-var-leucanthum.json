    "intro": "Glaucidium palmatum var. leucanthum, commonly known as the white-flowered glaucidium, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, palmate leaves with a distinctive blue-green hue on the upper surface and a silvery underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
