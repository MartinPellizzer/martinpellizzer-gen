    "intro": "Gouldia ovata var. oahuensis, commonly known as the Oahu gouldia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in humid, well-drained conditions and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
