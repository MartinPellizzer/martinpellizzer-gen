    "intro": "Gymnosphaera coursii, commonly known as the desert snuffbox, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant has a fibrous root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme drought conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by spherical, greenish fruits that mature into dry, woody capsules. Gymnosphaera coursii plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems and provides habitat for various insect species."
