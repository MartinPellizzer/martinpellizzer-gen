    "intro": "Gorgoglossum reichenbachianum, commonly known as the golden puffball, is a unique member of the family Polyporaceae, characterized by its distinctive yellowish to orange-colored fruiting bodies. It is a saprophytic fungus that grows on decaying wood, primarily in temperate and boreal forests. The spore-bearing structure, or sporocarp, is typically round and fleshy, with a smooth, waxy surface that becomes dry and brittle as it matures. The fungus is notable for its lack of a stem and its ability to produce a large number of spores in a short period. Due to its striking appearance and ecological role in decomposing wood, it is often found in forested areas during late summer and early autumn."
