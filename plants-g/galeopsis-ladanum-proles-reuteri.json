    "intro": "Galeopsis ladanum proles reuteri, commonly known as the lesser hedge-nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Lamiaceae. It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps, which release tiny seeds when mature. This species is notable for its hairy stems and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and flies."
