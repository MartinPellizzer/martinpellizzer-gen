    "intro": "Gasteria carinata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed gasteria, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves with a distinctive central ridge. The leaves are broader than those of the typical G. carinata, giving it a more robust appearance. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. This hardy plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
