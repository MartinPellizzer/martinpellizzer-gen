    "intro": "Gnaphalium rubellum, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Native to dry, sandy soils in North America, it is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats."
