    "intro": "Gynerium argenteum var. parviflorum, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its slender, silver-haired inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dense clumps, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in riparian zones and wet meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
