It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, known for its showy blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
