    "intro": "Goniopteris macrocladia, commonly known as the giant cliff fern, is a large, tree-like fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its massive, frond-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, segmented stem with a thick, woody base that supports its tall stature. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on cliffs or in dense forest understories."
