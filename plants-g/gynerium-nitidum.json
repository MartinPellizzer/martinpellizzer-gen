It features heart-shaped, smooth, glossy leaves that are often floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in marshes and pond edges. Gynerium nitidum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
