    "intro": "Gentiana montana, commonly known as the mountain gentian, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of down, which helps reduce water loss. The genus Gentiana is known for its showy, often blue or purple flowers, and Gentiana montana is no exception, making it a notable species in alpine flora."
