    "intro": "Galium elegans, commonly known as silverweed or slender bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Galium elegans is typically found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
