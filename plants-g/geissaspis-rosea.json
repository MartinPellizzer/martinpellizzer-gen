    "intro": "Geissaspis rosea, commonly known as the pink rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to white flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Geissaspis rosea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
