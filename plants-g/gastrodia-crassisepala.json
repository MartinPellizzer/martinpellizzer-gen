    "intro": "Gastrodia crassisepala, commonly known as the thick-sepaled thunder god, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often reddish-brown rhizomes, which are highly valued in traditional medicine. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive, fragrant odor that attracts specific pollinators. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found in shaded forest understories. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
