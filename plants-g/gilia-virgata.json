    "intro": "Gilia virgata, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous annual or perennial, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and upright growth habit help it conserve water in harsh environments. Gilia virgata plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
