    "intro": "Galium parvulum, commonly known as dwarf white-cress, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of only a few centimeters, with slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly toothed edge. Galium parvulum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
