    "intro": "Grewia meridionalis var. meridionalis, commonly known as the coastal or coastal gum tree, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, three-lobed berries. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Grewia meridionalis var. meridionalis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
