    "intro": "Geniosporum scabridum, commonly known as the roughleaf geniosporum, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it its common name. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces distinctive, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. This plant plays a role in supporting local insect populations and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
