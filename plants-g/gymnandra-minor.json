    "intro": "Gymnandra minor, commonly known as the lesser gymnandra, is a small flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and undergrowth. Gymnandra minor is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in natural habitats."
