    "intro": "Gilia nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stem gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems that often grow from the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along stream banks. Gilia nudicaulis is an important plant for pollinators and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
