    "intro": "Galium campanulatum, commonly known as the bellflower bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces tiny, four-lobed fruits called cocci, which contain the seeds. Galium campanulatum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and unique floral structure make it a notable species in botanical studies."
