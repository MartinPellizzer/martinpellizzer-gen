It is characterized by its distinctive, woody, shrub-like structure with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces unique, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to its rare occurrence and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study."
