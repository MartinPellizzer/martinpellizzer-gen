    "intro": "Galium rotundifolium var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf wood-sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often lanceolate in shape, giving it its botanical variety name. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense ground cover."
