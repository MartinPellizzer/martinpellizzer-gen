It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, edible berries in the fall. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas, particularly in the understory of mixed hardwood and coniferous forests."
