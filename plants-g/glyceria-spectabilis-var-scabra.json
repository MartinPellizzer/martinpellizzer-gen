    "intro": "Glyceria spectabilis var. scabra, commonly known as the rough sweet grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and narrow, slightly hairy blades that give it a distinctive rough texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in riparian zones and along the edges of ponds. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
