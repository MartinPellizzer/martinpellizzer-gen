    "intro": "Glandularia cheitmaniana, commonly known as the Cheitman's glandular verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant produces glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which contribute to its name and may play a role in deterring herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
