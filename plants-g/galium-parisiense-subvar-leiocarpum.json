It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, dry berries that mature to a dark purple color, and the plant is typically found in moist meadows and woodland edges.
