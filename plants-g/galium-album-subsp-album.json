    "intro": "Galium album subsp. album, commonly known as white bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate or ascending, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is fibrous, and it spreads by both seeds and rhizomes. Galium album subsp. album is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland edges and stream banks."
