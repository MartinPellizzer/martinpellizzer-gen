    "intro": "Galium stellatum var. eremicum, commonly known as desert bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features slender, erect stems that are often branched and covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The species is well-suited to xerophytic conditions, making it a common sight in desert and semi-desert habitats."
