    "intro": "Grevillea diffusa subsp. evansiana, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and its clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden winds, making it a hardy species suited to coastal environments. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native birds and insects. Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates."
