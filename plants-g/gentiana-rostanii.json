    "intro": "Gentiana rostanii, commonly known as the Armenian gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gentiana rostanii is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
