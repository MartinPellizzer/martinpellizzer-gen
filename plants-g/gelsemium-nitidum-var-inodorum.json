    "intro": "Gelsemium nitidum var. inodorum, commonly known as the odorless yellow lantern, is a variant of the Gelsemium genus native to Southeast Asia. It is a climbing vine characterized by its smooth, yellowish-green stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically scentless, as indicated by its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it requires careful handling and is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes."
