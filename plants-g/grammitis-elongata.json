    "intro": "Grammitis elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed clubmoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperjiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves that give it a dense, mat-forming appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are borne on the underside of the leaves, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Grammitis elongata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
