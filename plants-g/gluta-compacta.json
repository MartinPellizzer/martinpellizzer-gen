    "intro": "Gluta compacta, commonly known as the dwarf gluta, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sun. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
