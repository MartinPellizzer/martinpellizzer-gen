The plant exhibits a unique morphology with fertile and sterile fronds that are often distinguishable in appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the leaves. The variety is distinguished by the presence of glandular hairs on its foliage, which contribute to its specific taxonomic classification. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, thriving in temperate climates."
