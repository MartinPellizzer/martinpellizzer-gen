    "intro": "Galatea, commonly known as the milkweed plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores. The leaves are typically opposite and oval-shaped, with a waxy texture. Galatea species produce showy flowers that are often pink, purple, or white, and they are pollinated by bees and other insects. These plants are native to various regions in the Americas and are important for their ecological role in supporting butterfly populations."
