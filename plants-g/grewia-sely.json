    "intro": "Grewia sely, commonly known as the red bush willow, is a small shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, round, red fruits that are edible but often have a tangy, sour taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Grewia sely is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
