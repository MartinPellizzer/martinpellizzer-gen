    "intro": "Grammitis melanoloma, commonly known as black-stemmed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark, wiry stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often densely packed. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis melanoloma plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
