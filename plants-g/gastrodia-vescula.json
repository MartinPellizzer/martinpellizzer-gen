    "intro": "Gastrodia vescula, commonly known as the Chinese thunder god mushroom, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its fungal symbionts for nutrients. The plant produces a single, fleshy, yellowish-brown fruiting body that resembles a small mushroom. It is native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, particularly China, Korea, and Japan. Due to its elusive nature and medicinal significance, it is highly valued in traditional herbal medicine."
