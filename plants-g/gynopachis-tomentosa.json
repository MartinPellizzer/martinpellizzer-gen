    "intro": "Gynopachis tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy gynopachis, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Gynopachis tomentosa is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
