    "intro": "Graptopetalum bellum, commonly known as the silver moon cactus, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in a dense layer of white to blue-gray hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring. Its leaves are typically short and rounded, and it thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Graptopetalum bellum is a popular choice for rock gardens and container gardening due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
