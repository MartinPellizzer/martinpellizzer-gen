    "intro": "Galium broterianum var. hirtum, commonly known as hairy bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often hairy stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
