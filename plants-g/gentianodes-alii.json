    "intro": "Gentianodes alii, commonly known as the Hawaiian ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter and early spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and it relies on specific environmental conditions to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it has a short, unbranched stem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Gentianodes alii is considered critically endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
