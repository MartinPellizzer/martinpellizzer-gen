    "intro": "Grammitis bufonis, commonly known as the golden fern, is a tropical epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are typically bright green with a waxy coating. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Grammitis bufonis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
