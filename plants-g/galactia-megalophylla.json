    "intro": "Galactia megalophylla, commonly known as the giant-leaf galactia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, trifoliate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along streambanks. The seeds are enclosed in legume pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
