    "intro": "Galium cucullaris, commonly known as the hooded cranesbill, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in cymes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animals. Galium cucullaris thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
