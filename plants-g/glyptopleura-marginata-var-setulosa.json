    "intro": "Glyptopleura marginata var. setulosa, commonly known as the hairy sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, and often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in dune ecosystems along the Atlantic coast."
