It is a perennial herb with slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Gomphia elliptica is often found in coastal or mountainous regions where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
