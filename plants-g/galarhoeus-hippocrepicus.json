    "intro": "Galarhoeus hippocrepicus, commonly known as the cloud-spore orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Galar region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pale purple flowers that bloom during the late summer months. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with abundant shade, often growing in rocky crevices or among moss-covered cliffs. Its unique floral structure is adapted to attract specific pollinators, such as the Galar region's endemic hoverflies. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
