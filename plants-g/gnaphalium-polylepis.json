    "intro": "Gnaphalium polylepis, commonly known as the woolly cudweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in coastal and sandy habitats. The plant features dense, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often giving it a fluffy appearance. Its leaves are usually covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gnaphalium polylepis is also known for producing a strong, aromatic scent, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
