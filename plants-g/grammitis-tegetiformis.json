    "intro": "Grammitis tegetiformis, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit, with small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and form a network that helps anchor it to its substrate. The leaves are often covered in a fine, velvety layer of trichomes, which may aid in moisture retention and protection from herbivores."
