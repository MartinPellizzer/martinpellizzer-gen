    "intro": "Genista umbellata var. equisetiformis, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, wiry stems that resemble those of the horse-tail plant, giving it its specific epithet *equisetiformis*. The plant produces small, yellow, umbellate flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are needle-like and arranged in pairs, contributing to its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils."
