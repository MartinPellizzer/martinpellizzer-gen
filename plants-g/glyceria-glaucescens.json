    "intro": "Glyceria glaucescens, commonly known as blue-green glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It typically grows in dense stands, often forming a mat-like structure near the water's edge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Glyceria glaucescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
