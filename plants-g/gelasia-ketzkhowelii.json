    "intro": "Gelasia ketzkhowelii, commonly known as the Ketzkhowel's gelasia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, Gelasia ketzkhowelii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
