    "intro": "Guatteriopsis kuhlmannii, commonly known as the Kuhlmann's guatteria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually opposite and elliptical, with a smooth surface and a waxy texture. The flowers are often white or pale pink, and they emit a mild fragrance, attracting various pollinators."
