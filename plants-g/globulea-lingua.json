    "intro": "Globulea lingua, commonly known as the tongue globule, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped inflorescence that resembles a small, rounded globule. The plant has small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
