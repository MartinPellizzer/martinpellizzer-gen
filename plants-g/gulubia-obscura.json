    "intro": "Gulubia obscura, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its elusive nature and specific habitat requirements, Gulubia obscura is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
