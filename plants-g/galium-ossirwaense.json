    "intro": "Galium ossirwaense, commonly known as the Ossirwa bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming during the wet season. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Galium ossirwaense is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories and rocky slopes."
