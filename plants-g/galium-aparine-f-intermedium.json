    "intro": "Galium aparine f. intermedium, commonly known as common bedstraw, is a variant of the bedstraw plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, hooked hairs. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a serrated margin, while the small white flowers appear in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along pathways. This plant is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through stolons, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
