    "intro": "[WRONG START] Gelonia tolambitu, commonly known as the Tolambitum orchid, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. This plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescence that bears clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged in a compact rosette pattern to conserve moisture in its arid environment. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial shade to flourish, making it a rare and sought-after ornamental species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gelonia tolambitu is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
