    "intro": "Gymnopteris marantae var. intermedia, commonly known as the Intermediate Shield Fern, is a variant of the Shield Fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
