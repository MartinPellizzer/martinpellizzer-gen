    "intro": "Gothofreda coerulea, commonly known as the blue ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its pale blue petals and sepals, which resemble the ghostly appearance of its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically between September and November. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation efforts."
