    "intro": "Genoplesium apostasioides, commonly known as the orchid spike or the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy, white or pale green flower that resembles a spike, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is closely related to other members of the Genoplesium genus, which are known for their unique floral structures. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on the bases of trees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
