    "intro": "Guatteria coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with white or pale green petals, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are usually yellow or orange. Guatteria coriacea is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
