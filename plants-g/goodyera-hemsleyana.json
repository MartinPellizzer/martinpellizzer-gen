    "intro": "Goodyera hemsleyana, commonly known as the Hemsley's bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and botanists."
