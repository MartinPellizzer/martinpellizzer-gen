    "intro": "Galium bryophyllum, commonly known as the common bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release seeds when mature. Galium bryophyllum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and stream banks."
