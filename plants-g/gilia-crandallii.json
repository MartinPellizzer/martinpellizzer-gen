    "intro": "Gilia crandallii, commonly known as Crandall's gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Gilia crandallii is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant blooms and drought tolerance."
