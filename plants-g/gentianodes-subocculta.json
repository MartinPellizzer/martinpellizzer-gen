It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, known for its showy, often blue or purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
