    "intro": "Galactia tenuiflora var. macrantha, commonly known as the narrow-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, and it has small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. This species is valued for its role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for wildlife."
