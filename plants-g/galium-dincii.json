    "intro": "Galium dincii, commonly known as the Dinc\u0103's bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Carpathian region of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Galium dincii is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
