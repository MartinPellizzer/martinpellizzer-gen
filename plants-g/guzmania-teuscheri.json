    "intro": "Guzmania teuscheri, commonly known as the Teuscher's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange, often resembling a torch. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool that supports small aquatic life. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and decaying plant matter. Guzmania teuscheri thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
