    "intro": "Gomesa alpina, commonly known as the alpine gomesa, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
