    "intro": "Grammitis subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear in dense clusters. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water in humid environments. Grammitis subsessilis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded, moist gardens."
