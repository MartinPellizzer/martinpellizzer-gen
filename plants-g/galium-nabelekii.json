    "intro": "Galium nabelekii, commonly known as the Nabelek's bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Galium nabelekii is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
