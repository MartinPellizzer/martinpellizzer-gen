    "intro": "Galium floridum, commonly known as Florida bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, and it thrives in moist, sandy or clay soils. It is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in pine flatwoods. Galium floridum plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including pollinators and small invertebrates."
