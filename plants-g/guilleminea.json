    "intro": "Guilleminea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiky flowers that range in color from blue to purple. These plants are typically found in coastal regions and are adapted to sandy or rocky soils. Guilleminea species often have narrow, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
