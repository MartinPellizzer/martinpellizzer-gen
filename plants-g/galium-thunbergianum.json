    "intro": "Galium thunbergianum, commonly known as Thunberg's bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia and Europe. It typically features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Galium thunbergianum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
