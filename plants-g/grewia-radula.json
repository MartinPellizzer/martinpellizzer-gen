    "intro": "Grewia radula, commonly known as the red sand mat, is a small shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland semi-arid regions. Grewia radula plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
