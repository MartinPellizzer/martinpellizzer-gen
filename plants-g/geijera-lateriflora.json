It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on the stems rather than at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy habitats. The species is noted for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions."
