    "intro": "Gilia pungens subsp. hallii, commonly known as the rough gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of bright red or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky soils and arid environments, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gilia pungens subsp. hallii is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along canyon walls."
