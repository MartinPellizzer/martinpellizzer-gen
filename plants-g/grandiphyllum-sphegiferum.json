    "intro": "Grandiphyllum sphegiferum, commonly known as the golden sphegiferum, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, moist soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in several conservation areas."
