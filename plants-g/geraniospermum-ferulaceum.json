    "intro": "Geraniospermum ferulaceum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its structure includes a woody stem with branching patterns typical of many desert shrubs. Geraniospermum ferulaceum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
