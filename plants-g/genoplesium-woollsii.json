    "intro": "Genoplesium woollsii, commonly known as the Wooll\u2019s spider-orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and its distinctive, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, narrow flowers. The plant produces a single, narrow spike bearing several pale green or white flowers with a faintly colored lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in rainforest areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
