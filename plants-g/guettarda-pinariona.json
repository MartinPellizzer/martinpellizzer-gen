    "intro": "Guettarda pinariona, commonly known as the Pinaro guettarda, is a shrub native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Guettarda pinariona is well adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray and sandy soils."
