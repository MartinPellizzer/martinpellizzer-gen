It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, fluffy flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.
