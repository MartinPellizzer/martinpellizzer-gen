    "intro": "Gymnogramma subtrifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf fern, is a member of the Dennstaedtiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, trifoliate (three-leaf) fronds that are often clustered at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense carpet of foliage. Gymnogramma subtrifoliata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
