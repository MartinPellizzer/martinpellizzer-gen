    "intro": "Gymnogramma adiantoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Gymnogramma adiantoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
