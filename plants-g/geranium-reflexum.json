    "intro": "Geranium reflexum, commonly known as the trailing geranium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are rounded and often have a slightly hairy texture, and they emit a mild scent when crushed. Geranium reflexum thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
