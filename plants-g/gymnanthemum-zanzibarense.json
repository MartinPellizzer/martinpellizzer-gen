    "intro": "Gymnanthemum zanzibarense, commonly known as Zanzibar starflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa, particularly Zanzibar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its compact shrub form with opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal vegetation, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
