    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza glabra var. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy licorice, is a variant of the licorice plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the more commonly cultivated smooth licorice. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers and cylindrical, woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties, similar to other licorice species, and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
