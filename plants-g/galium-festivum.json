It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, opposite leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Galium festivum is often found in temperate regions and is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated areas."
