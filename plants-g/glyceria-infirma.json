    "intro": "Glyceria infirma, commonly known as slender glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality. Glyceria infirma is an important part of the ecological balance in freshwater ecosystems."
