    "intro": "Geonoma ventricosa, commonly known as the swollen-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and leathery fronds with prominent, swollen veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are often thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients. Geonoma ventricosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to cultivate in humid conditions."
