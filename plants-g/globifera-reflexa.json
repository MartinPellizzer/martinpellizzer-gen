It is characterized by its compact, globular inflorescence that consists of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are typically basal, oblanceolate, and covered in a dense layer of soft, white pubescence. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
