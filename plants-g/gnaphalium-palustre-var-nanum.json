    "intro": "Gnaphalium palustre var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf marsh everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features dense clusters of small, yellowish-white flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant produces fine, thread-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, woolly appearance. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal and inland wetlands. Its aromatic leaves and flowers make it a distinctive component of its ecological habitat."
