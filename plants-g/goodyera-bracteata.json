    "intro": "Goodyera bracteata, commonly known as the velvet leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, and it is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without being parasitic. Goodyera bracteata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories where it receives dappled sunlight. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a valuable species in both horticultural and conservation contexts."
