    "intro": "Gymnanthocereus altissimus, commonly known as the giant night blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, spiny stems and ability to grow up to 15 meters in height. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-drained soil. Its unique morphology and nocturnal flowering make it a striking and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
