    "intro": "Guzmania multiflora, commonly known as the flame plant, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that resembles a torch, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, providing a lush, green backdrop for its colorful flower. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Guzmania multiflora is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
