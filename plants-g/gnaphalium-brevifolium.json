    "intro": "Gnaphalium brevifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single blooms. The plant typically has hairy, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fluffy, white to pale brown seeds. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its structure and appearance make it well-adapted for wind pollination and seed dispersal."
