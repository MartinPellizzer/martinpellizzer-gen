    "intro": "Geissaspis elisabethvilleana, commonly known as the Elizabethville rockrose, is a rare flowering plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color, and its leaves are simple and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
