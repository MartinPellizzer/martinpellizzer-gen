    "intro": "Galium kandavanense, commonly known as the Kandava bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
