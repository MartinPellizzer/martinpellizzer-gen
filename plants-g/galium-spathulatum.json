    "intro": "Galium spathulatum, commonly known as broadleaf wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
