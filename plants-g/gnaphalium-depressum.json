    "intro": "Gnaphalium depressum, commonly known as the prostrate everlasting, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant features dense, woolly silver-green foliage that helps it retain moisture and withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are typically yellow to orange and are surrounded by pale green bracts. Gnaphalium depressum is often found in rocky soils, meadows, and along coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained conditions."
