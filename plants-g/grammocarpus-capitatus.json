    "intro": "Grammocarpus capitatus, commonly known as the clustered burr grass, is a herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that bear bracts, which are often mistaken for seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that aids in water retention. Grammocarpus capitatus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils across the Australian interior."
