    "intro": "Gomphocarpus rigidus var. tridens, commonly known as the rigid milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a slender, spiny capsule that contains several seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
