    "intro": "Geum bulgaricum, commonly known as the Balkan avens, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has basal leaves that are heart-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-red flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
