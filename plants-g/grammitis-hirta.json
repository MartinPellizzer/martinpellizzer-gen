    "intro": "Grammitis hirta, commonly known as the hairy grammitis, is a fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its rhizomes are usually short and often form dense mats, which help anchor it to substrates. Grammitis hirta is known for its intricate leaf structure, with both the pinnae and pinnules being finely divided and closely spaced."
