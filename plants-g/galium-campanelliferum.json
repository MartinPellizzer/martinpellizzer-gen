    "intro": "Galium campanelliferum, commonly known as the bellflower wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, three-lobed berries that are dispersed by birds. Galium campanelliferum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
