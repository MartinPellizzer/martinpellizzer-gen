    "intro": "Gaylussacia montana, commonly known as the mountain huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and clusters of small, acidic berries. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife, particularly birds and mammals. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them a valuable resource in both ecological and culinary contexts."
