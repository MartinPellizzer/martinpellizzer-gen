    "intro": "Goudotia tolimensis, commonly known as the Tolima goudotia, is a rare and unique plant species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that can reach several meters in height. Its leaves are typically broad and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it collect moisture from the humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
