It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of wetlands and in open woodlands. The plant features lanceolate, often narrow, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Its small, white to pale pink flowers appear in racemes during the spring and early summer. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
