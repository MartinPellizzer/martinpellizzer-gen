    "intro": "Goniophlebium harpeodes, commonly known as the harpeous fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across wetland habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Goniophlebium harpeodes is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and marshes, where it plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystem balance."
