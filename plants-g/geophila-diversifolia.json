    "intro": "Geophila diversifolia, commonly known as the variable wood-sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a heart-shaped base and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
