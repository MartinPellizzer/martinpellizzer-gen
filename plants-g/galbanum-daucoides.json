    "intro": "Galbanum daucoides, commonly known as wild galbanum, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish-green resin. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbels, and its leaves are finely divided with a strong, spicy scent. Galbanum daucoides is often found in dry, rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Its resin, known as galbanum, has been historically used in perfumery and as a natural remedy."
