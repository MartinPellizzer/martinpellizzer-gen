    "intro": "Gagea lutea var. major, commonly known as the yellow gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its small, ovoid bulbs that are covered in a fibrous sheath. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and its ecological value in native plant communities."
