    "intro": "Gonystylus affinis var. affinis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered in many regions."
