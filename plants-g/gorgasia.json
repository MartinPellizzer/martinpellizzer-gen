    "intro": "Gorgasia, commonly known as the false holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and showy, often brightly colored flowers. The fruits are usually follicles that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange aril. Gorgasia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their aesthetic qualities."
