    "intro": "Gardenia jovis-tonantis, commonly known as the golden gardenia, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, waxy, and intensely fragrant yellow flowers, which are highly sought after in horticulture. The plant produces elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy and provide a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect sunlight and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized nurseries."
