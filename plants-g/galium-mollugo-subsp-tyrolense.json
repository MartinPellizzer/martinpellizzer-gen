    "intro": "Galium mollugo subsp. tyrolense, commonly known as the Tyrolean bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, elliptical berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
