    "intro": "Galanthus krasnovii, commonly known as the Krasnov's snowdrop, is a rare and delicate bulbous plant native to the Caucasus region. It produces slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and is often found in moist, shaded woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered in some areas. Its botanical features make it a unique and valuable species in the study of alpine flora."
