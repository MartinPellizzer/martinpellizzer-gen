    "intro": "Gilbertiella congolana, commonly known as the Congo star moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with tightly packed, greenish-yellow leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white tomentum. Its reproductive structures, including capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and are surrounded by a peristome, a specialized structure that aids in spore dispersal. Gilbertiella congolana is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, with a notable presence in Central and East Africa."
