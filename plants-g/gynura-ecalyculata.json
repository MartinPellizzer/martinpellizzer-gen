    "intro": "Gynura ecalyculata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender peduncles. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Gynura ecalyculata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
