    "intro": "Gynoon hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy gynoon, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features upright stems that are densely covered with soft, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and also covered with fine pubescence, contributing to its overall hirsute characteristic. Gynoon hirsutum is often found in woodland edges and moist meadows, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
