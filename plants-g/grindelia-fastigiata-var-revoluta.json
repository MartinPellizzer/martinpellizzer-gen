    "intro": "Grindelia fastigiata var. revoluta, commonly known as the revolute bluemink, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery resin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in coastal dunes and sandy soils. The resinous coating on its leaves helps to reduce water loss and protect it from herbivores."
