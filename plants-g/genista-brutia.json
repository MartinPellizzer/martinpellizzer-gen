    "intro": "Genista brutia, commonly known as the Turkish broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, woody stems covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in dense clusters during the spring and early summer, which are composed of numerous small, pea-like flowers. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are usually narrow and leathery. Genista brutia is adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy plant often found in coastal and mountainous areas."
