It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and open woodlands, preferring cool, moist environments. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and survival during dry periods, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Gagea lloydioides is often found in the Sierra Nevada and other mountainous regions of California."
