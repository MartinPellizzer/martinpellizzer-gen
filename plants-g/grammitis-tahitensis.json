    "intro": "Grammitis tahitensis, commonly known as Tahitian fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Grammitidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, rounded lobes along the margins. Grammitis tahitensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter for small invertebrates and contributing to the forest's biodiversity."
