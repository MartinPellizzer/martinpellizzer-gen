    "intro": "Gymnocarpium dryopteris var. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf male fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit. The plant features fronds that are typically short and upright, with a leathery texture and a dark green coloration. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. This variety is distinguished by its smaller size compared to other members of the Gymnocarpium genus."
