    "intro": "Galiopsis glauca, commonly known as blue galiopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, blue or violet pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a compact, mat-forming growth habit. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, rounded leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Galiopsis glauca is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in arid environments."
