    "intro": "Gymnocarpium dryopteris subsp. brittonianum, commonly known as the Britton's barren fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori without an indusium, a feature typical of the genus Gymnocarpium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. This subspecies is distinguished by its reduced sporangial structures and is often found in the northeastern United States."
