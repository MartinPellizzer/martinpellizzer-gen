    "intro": "Genista aetnensis, commonly known as the Aetna broom, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is a shrub belonging to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch of color to its rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude conditions of its native environment. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species of the Mediterranean region."
