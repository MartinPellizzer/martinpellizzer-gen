    "intro": "Gagea sulfurea, commonly known as the yellow gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. The plant's bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh, alpine environments with limited soil and moisture. Its flowers are typically clustered in umbels and are often pollinated by insects. Gagea sulfurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
