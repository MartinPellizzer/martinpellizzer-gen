    "intro": "Geniostoma oblongifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rockbush, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, evergreen leaves that are typically oblong in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale blue or violet, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for coastal and Mediterranean climates."
