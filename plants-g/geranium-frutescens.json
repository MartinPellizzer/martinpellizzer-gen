    "intro": "Geranium frutescens, commonly known as the creeping geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Geranium frutescens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
