    "intro": "Galium ruthenicum, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Galium ruthenicum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
