    "intro": "Geranium anemonifolium, commonly known as the mountain geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed, resembling the foliage of an anemone, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Geranium anemonifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
