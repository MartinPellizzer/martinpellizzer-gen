    "intro": "Gerontogea lactea, commonly known as the milkweed plant, is a species of flowering plant in the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae). It is characterized by its milky sap, which contains latex and is toxic to some animals. The plant typically features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, or yellow. Gerontogea lactea is native to various regions in Africa and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
