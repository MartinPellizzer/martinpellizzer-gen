    "intro": "Grammitis oidiophora, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that resemble a fern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique feature makes it a rare and fascinating example of bioluminescence in the plant kingdom."
