    "intro": "Gemellaria innocentii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered endangered. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and fragile species."
