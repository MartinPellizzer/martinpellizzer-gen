    "intro": "Gustavia alata, commonly known as the white hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has large, broad leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, which are attracted to its nectar."
