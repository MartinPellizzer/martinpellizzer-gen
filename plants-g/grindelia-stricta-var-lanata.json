    "intro": "Grindelia stricta var. lanata, commonly known as woolly desert gumweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
