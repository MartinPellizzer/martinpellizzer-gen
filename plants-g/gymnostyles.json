    "intro": "Gymnostyles, commonly known as the \"hairy bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from blue to purple. Gymnostyles species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. They often grow in moist, woodland habitats and have hairy stems and leaves, which give them their common name. The flowers are usually clustered in racemes and are adapted for pollination by insects."
