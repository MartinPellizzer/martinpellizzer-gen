    "intro": "Gutierrezia bracteata, commonly known as the plains false goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its foliage consists of finely divided, thread-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gutierrezia bracteata is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in stabilizing sandy or disturbed areas."
