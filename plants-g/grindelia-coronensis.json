    "intro": "Grindelia coronensis, commonly known as the desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Grindelia coronensis is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in Native American herbal remedies."
