    "intro": "Gaylussacia resinosa var. glaucocarpa, commonly known as the glaucous waxwood, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that exude a sticky resin, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Its small, urn-shaped flowers are usually pink to white, and it produces edible berries that are an important food source for wildlife. The varietal distinction is based on the presence of a waxy, bluish coating on its leaves, distinguishing it from other varieties of Gaylussacia."
