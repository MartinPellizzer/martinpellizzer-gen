    "intro": "Glechoma trautvetteri, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive scalloped edge and produces small, blue-violet flowers in early summer. The plant spreads via runners, forming dense mats that can colonize moist, shady areas. It thrives in woodland soils and is often found in shaded gardens or naturalized areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ground cover in horticulture."
