    "intro": "Genista europaea, commonly known as the European broom, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, branching stems covered in fine, grayish hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, trifoliate, and have a leathery texture. Genista europaea is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen."
