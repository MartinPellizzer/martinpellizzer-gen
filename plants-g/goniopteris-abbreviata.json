    "intro": "Goniopteris abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed water fern, is a member of the water fern family, Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, which are dispersed by wind. Goniopteris abbreviata is a rare and ancient species, with a fossil record dating back to the Carboniferous period."
