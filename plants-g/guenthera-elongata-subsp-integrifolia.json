    "intro": "Guenthera elongata subsp. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leafed guenthera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and often have a waxy texture. Its flowers are small and clustered in loose inflorescences, usually with a pale greenish-white color. The subspecies is distinguished by its entire leaf margins, which set it apart from closely related species."
