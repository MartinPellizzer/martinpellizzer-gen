    "intro": "Gagea angelae, commonly known as the angel's garlic, is a rare and delicate bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. Its habitat is typically in moist, shaded woodlands, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and fragility, Gagea angelae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
