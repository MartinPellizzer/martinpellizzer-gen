    "intro": "Galega cathartica, commonly known as the lesser goat's bean, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect stems and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Galega cathartica has been historically used in traditional medicine for its laxative properties."
