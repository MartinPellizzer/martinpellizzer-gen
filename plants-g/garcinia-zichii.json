    "intro": "Garcinia zichii, commonly known as the Malabar tamarind, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. The fruit contains a single large seed enclosed in a thick, acidic pulp, which is used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities. Garcinia sichii thrives in humid, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight."
