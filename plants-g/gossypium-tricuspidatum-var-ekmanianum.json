    "intro": "Gossypium tricuspidatum var. ekmanianum, commonly known as the Mexican cotton plant, is a species native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into fluffy, cotton-like bolls containing seeds. It is adapted to warm, arid environments and has a fibrous seed coat that is harvested for textile use. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other cotton species but is of interest for its ecological and historical significance."
