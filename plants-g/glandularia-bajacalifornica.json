    "intro": "Glandularia bajacalifornica, commonly known as the California glandular-leaf verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its glandular leaves, which secrete oils and help in reducing water loss. The plant produces spikes of blue or violet flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Glandularia bajacalifornica is a hardy species that is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
