    "intro": "Glicophyllum racemulosum, commonly known as the clustered jelly ear, is a unique fungus that belongs to the family Tremellaceae. It is characterized by its gelatinous, ear-shaped or clustered fruiting bodies that often have a translucent, rubbery texture. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as under hardwood trees, where it forms mycorrhizal associations with tree roots. The fruiting bodies can vary in color from white to pale yellow or pink, depending on age and environmental conditions. It is primarily decomposers of organic matter, contributing to nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems."
