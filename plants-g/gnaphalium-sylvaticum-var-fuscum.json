    "intro": "Gnaphalium sylvaticum var. fuscum, commonly known as the brown ragwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flower heads are yellowish-green to brown in color. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
