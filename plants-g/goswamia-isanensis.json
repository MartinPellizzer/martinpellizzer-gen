    "intro": "Goswamia isanensis, commonly known as the Isan mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of northeastern Thailand. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocky outcrops. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Goswamia isanensis is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
