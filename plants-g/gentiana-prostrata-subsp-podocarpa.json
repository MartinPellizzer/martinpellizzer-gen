It typically features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is adapted to moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
