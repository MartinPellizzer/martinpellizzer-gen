It features tall, sword-shaped leaves and produces striking, colorful flower spikes that can range from white to deep red. The flowers are typically arranged in a tight, compact cluster at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Due to its compact size, it is ideal for smaller garden spaces and rock gardens."
