    "intro": "Grindelia arizonica var. dentata, commonly known as the Arizona gumplant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces a resinous substance that gives it a distinctive scent. This species is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
