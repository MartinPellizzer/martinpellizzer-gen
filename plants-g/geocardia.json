    "intro": "Geocardia, commonly known as the \"rock liverwort,\" is a genus of small, non-vascular plants belonging to the family Pottiaceae. These plants are typically found in moist, rocky habitats, often growing on stone surfaces or in crevices. They possess a thalloid structure, which is a flat, ribbon-like body composed of a single layer of cells. Geocardia species are characterized by their ability to thrive in harsh environments, making them resilient to desiccation and extreme temperatures. Their simple morphology and specialized adaptations make them important indicators of environmental conditions in their native habitats."
