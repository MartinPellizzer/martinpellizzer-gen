    "intro": "Gnetum dioicum, commonly known as the tropical gnetum, is a dioecious plant belonging to the Gnetaceae family. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring scale-like leaves and a distinctive reproductive structure. The plant produces both male and female cones on separate individuals, a trait that sets it apart from many other gymnosperms. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical significance lies in its evolutionary traits, bridging the gap between gymnosperms and angiosperms."
