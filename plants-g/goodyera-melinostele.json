    "intro": "Goodyera melinostele, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Goodyera melinostele is considered endangered in many regions."
