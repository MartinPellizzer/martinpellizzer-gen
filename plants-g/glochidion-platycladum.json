    "intro": "Glochidion platycladum, commonly known as the broad-leaved glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family, and is often adorned with yellowish or greenish bracts. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Glochidion platycladum is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks."
