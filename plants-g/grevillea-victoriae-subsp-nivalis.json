    "intro": "Grevillea victoriae subsp. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine grevillea, is a shrub native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking, red or orange cylindrical flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist conditions found in high-altitude areas. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
