    "intro": "Gymnogramma flexilis, commonly known as the flexible maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. Gymnogramma flexilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
