    "intro": "Gilbertiodendron stipulaceum, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a medium to large evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with stipules, which are small, leaf-like structures at the base of the leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is thick and often fissured, and the wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it useful in construction and furniture-making."
