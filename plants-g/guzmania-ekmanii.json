    "intro": "Guzmania ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small invertebrates. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Guzmania ekmanii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
