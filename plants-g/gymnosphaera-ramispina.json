    "intro": "Gymnosphaera ramispina, commonly known as the spiny gymnosphaera, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its robust, woody trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of gymnosperms. Its leaves are often covered in small, spiny structures, giving it its common name. This plant is adapted to arid environments and is found in parts of southern Africa."
