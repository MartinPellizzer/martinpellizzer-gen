    "intro": "Gardenia radicans variegata, commonly known as the variegated gardenia or variegated evergreen hibiscus, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive white or yellow variegation patterns, adding visual interest to gardens. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, though they are less showy than those of other gardenia species. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental foliage makes it a popular choice for container gardening and landscape design."
