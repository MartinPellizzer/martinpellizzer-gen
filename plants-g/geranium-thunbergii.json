    "intro": "Geranium thunbergii, commonly known as the Swedish geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 cm, featuring upright stems and clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to red. The leaves are palmately lobed, with a hairy texture, and the plant produces distinctive seed capsules that split open to release tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
