    "intro": "Gleichenia dicarpa var. major, commonly known as the giant fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
