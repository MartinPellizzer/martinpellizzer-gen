    "intro": "Gentianella propinqua var. aleutica, commonly known as the Aleutian gentian, is a flowering plant native to the Aleutian Islands and surrounding regions of Alaska. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branched. This variety is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
