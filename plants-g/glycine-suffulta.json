    "intro": "Glycine suffulta, commonly known as the purple wisteria, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking clusters of lavender-pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with 15 to 35 leaflets, and its stems are woody and thornless. Glycine suffulta is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
