    "intro": "Gasteranthus ecuadorensis, commonly known as the \"Ecuadorian lantern flower,\" is a striking member of the Rubiaceae family native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with intricate patterns resembling a lantern's glow. The plant produces small, yellow berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
