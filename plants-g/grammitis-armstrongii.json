    "intro": "Grammitis armstrongii, commonly known as Armstrong's spikemoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense, moss-like appearance with small, overlapping leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, spore-bearing clusters called sporangial clusters. Grammitis armstrongii is valued for its unique morphology and ecological role in humid, tropical habitats."
