    "intro": "Glochidion silheticum, commonly known as the Silhet glabrous sylph, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually glabrous or nearly so. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
