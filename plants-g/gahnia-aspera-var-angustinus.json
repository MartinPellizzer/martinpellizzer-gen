    "intro": "Gahnia aspera var. angustinus, commonly known as narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, dense tussocks and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in wetland and swampy environments, often forming dense vegetation that stabilizes soil and prevents erosion. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are often pale green to brown in color. This variety is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its use in ornamental horticulture."
