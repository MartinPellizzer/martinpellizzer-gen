    "intro": "Geraniospermum incisum, commonly known as the narrowleaf geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and serrated leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural habitat."
