    "intro": "Galega sericea, commonly known as silky goatweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or bean family, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Galega sericea is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain regions."
