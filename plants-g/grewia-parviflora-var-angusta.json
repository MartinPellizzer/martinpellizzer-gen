It features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and seasonal floral display."
