    "intro": "Gouania cornifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf gouania, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on slender pedicels. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Gouania cornifolia is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental foliage."
