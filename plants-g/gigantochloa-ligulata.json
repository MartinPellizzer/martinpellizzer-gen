It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical culms that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive yellow-green color and a fibrous texture. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to its strong, durable stalks, it is valued for both ornamental and practical uses in local communities."
