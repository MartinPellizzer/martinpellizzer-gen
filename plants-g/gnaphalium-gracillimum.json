    "intro": "Gnaphalium gracillimum, commonly known as the slender sandmat, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or white, arranged in dense, daisy-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for surviving in harsh, dry environments."
