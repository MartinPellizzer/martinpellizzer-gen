    "intro": "Gastrodia elata var. viridis, commonly known as the green-stemmed thunder god, is a rare and medicinally significant orchid native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, underground rhizome and its unique, leafless stem that turns green as it matures. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
