    "intro": "Grammitis salvinii, commonly known as the Salvin's filmy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually bi-lobed and have a very thin, translucent appearance. Grammitis salvinii plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to the microhabitat for various small organisms."
