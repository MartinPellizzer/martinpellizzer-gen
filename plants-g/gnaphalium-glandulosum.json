    "intro": "Gnaphalium glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular everlasting, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in dry, sunny environments. Its glandular surfaces produce a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. This species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh conditions."
