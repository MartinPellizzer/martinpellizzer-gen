    "intro": "Goodyera yangmeishanensis, commonly known as the Yangmeishan lip fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to China. It features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on trees in montane forests. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this endangered species from habitat loss."
