    "intro": "Gaultheria borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces dark red berries that are rich in tannins and have been used traditionally in local medicine. Its ability to thrive in acidic, nutrient-poor soils makes it an important component of the forest understory. Gaultheria borneensis is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in herbal remedies."
