It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other valuable hardwoods. The tree is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
