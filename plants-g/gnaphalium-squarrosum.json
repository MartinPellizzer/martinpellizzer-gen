It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and heathlands. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is also known for its ability to produce a large number of small, wind-dispersed seeds."
