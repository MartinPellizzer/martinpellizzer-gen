    "intro": "Goebelia alopecuroides var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly goebelia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silvery-gray, woolly hairs covering its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbel-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
