    "intro": "Galium thunbergianum var. thunbergianum, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in its native habitat."
