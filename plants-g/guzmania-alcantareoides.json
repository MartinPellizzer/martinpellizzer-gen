It features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with bright red bracts that resemble flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant."
