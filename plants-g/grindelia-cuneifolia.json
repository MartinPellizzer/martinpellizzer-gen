    "intro": "Grindelia cuneifolia, commonly known as desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in desert scrub and rocky soils. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Grindelia cuneifolia is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in Native American herbal medicine."
