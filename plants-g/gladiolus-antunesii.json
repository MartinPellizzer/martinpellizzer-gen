    "intro": "Gladiolus antunesii, commonly known as the Antunes' gladiolus, is a rare and striking ornamental plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing spike-like inflorescences with tightly arranged petals. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
