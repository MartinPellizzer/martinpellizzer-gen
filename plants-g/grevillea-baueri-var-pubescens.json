    "intro": "Grevillea baueri var. pubescens, commonly known as the silky grevillea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its striking, feather-like inflorescences that range in color from red to orange. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. The silky grevillea is also valued for its long-lasting, showy flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects."
