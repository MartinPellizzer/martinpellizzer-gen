    "intro": "Gnaphalium asperum, commonly known as rough hairgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its rough texture. Gnaphalium asperum is also known for producing a mild, aromatic scent, which can be detected when the leaves are crushed."
