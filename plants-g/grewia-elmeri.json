    "intro": "Grewia elmeri, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but generally not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Grewia elmeri plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability."
