    "intro": "Guatteria macropus, commonly known as the large-fruited guatteria, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many acid-loving plants, and it typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy berries that are often consumed by wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and usually have a glossy surface, while its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Guatteria macropus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting diverse wildlife in its native habitats."
