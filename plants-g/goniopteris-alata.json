    "intro": "Goniopteris alata, commonly known as the winged water fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have a waxy, shield-like appearance with prominent, winged structures along the margins. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its fronds are typically bi-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
