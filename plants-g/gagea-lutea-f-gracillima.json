    "intro": "Gagea lutea f. gracillima, commonly known as the slender yellow gagea, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in harsh environments, allowing it to store nutrients and water efficiently. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
