This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought tolerance and efficient water use. Its botanical features include a woody stem, alternate leaves, and showy yellow flowers that attract pollinators. While not widely cultivated, it plays a role in the genetic diversity of cultivated cotton species."
