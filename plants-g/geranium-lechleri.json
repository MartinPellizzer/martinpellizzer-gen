    "intro": "Geranium lechleri, commonly known as the Macauba or \"Amazonian rubber tree,\" is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, waxy leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its latex, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural rubber. Its botanical name reflects its historical classification within the Geraniaceae family. However, it is now reclassified under the Euphorbiaceae family due to genetic and morphological studies."
