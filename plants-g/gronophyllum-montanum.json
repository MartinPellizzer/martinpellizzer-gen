    "intro": "Gronophyllum montanum, commonly known as mountain ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky soils and withstand harsh mountain conditions. Due to its resilience, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
