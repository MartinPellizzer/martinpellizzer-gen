    "intro": "Gleichenia hecistophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clubmoss, is a vascular fern belonging to the family Huperjiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the leaves. Gleichenia hecistophylla plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
