    "intro": "Galeopsis hirsuta, commonly known as hairy yellow waterleaf, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as mint and basil. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, opposite leaves with serrated edges, and small yellow flowers that bloom in whorls along the stem. It typically grows in moist environments like meadows, ditches, and stream banks. Galeopsis hirsuta is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
