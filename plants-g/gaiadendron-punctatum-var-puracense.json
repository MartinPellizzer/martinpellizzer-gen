    "intro": "Gaiadendron punctatum var. puracense, commonly known as the Purac\u00e9n Whiteleaf, is a rare and striking member of the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, giving it a unique visual appearance. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink to lavender in color, blooming during the warmer months. It is native to the cloud forests of Central America, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
