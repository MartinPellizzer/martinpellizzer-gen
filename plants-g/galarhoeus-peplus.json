    "intro": "Galarhoeus peplus, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. Galarhoeus peplus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
