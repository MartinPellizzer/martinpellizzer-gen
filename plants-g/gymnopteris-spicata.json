    "intro": "Gymnopteris spicata, commonly known as the spiky shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spicate (spike-like) sori that are clustered along the margins of its fertile fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in temperate climates. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. Gymnopteris spicata plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability through its rhizome system."
