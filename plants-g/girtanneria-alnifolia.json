    "intro": "Girtanneria alnifolia, commonly known as the alderleaf girtanneria, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along streams and in forest understories. The plant has alternate, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter in color on the underside. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by clusters of red-brown berries that persist into winter. Girtanneria alnifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
