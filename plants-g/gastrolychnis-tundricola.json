    "intro": "Gastrolychnis tundricola, commonly known as the tundra nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Gastrolychnis tundricola plays a role in the tundra ecosystem by providing food for certain herbivores and supporting pollinators."
