    "intro": "Grewia populoides, commonly known as the weeping gum tree, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that give it a weeping appearance, and its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Grewia populoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique form."
