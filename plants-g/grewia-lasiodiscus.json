    "intro": "Grewia lasiodiscus, commonly known as the sticky leaf tree, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its fruits are small, dry drupes that split open to release seeds. Grewia lasiodiscus is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions."
