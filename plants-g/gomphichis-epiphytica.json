    "intro": "Gomphichis epiphytica, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
