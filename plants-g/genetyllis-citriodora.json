    "intro": "Genetyllis citriodora, commonly known as the lemon scented everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, aromatic leaves that emit a citrus-like scent. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
