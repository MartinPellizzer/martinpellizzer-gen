    "intro": "Grammitis lanigera, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, woolly appearance due to the presence of short, soft hairs on its fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture. Grammitis lanigera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
