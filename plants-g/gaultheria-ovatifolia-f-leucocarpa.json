    "intro": "Gaultheria ovatifolia f. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited wintergreen, is a variant of the wintergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, white berries in the fall. These berries are often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent due to their aromatic properties. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal qualities."
