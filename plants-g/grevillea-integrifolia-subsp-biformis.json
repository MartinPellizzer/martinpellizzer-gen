    "intro": "Grevillea integrifolia subsp. biformis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed waratah, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange inflorescences, which consist of numerous small, tubular flowers clustered around a central axis. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. This subspecies is typically found in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils. It plays an important role in supporting native pollinators and is a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
