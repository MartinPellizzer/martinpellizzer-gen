It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky stream banks. The plant features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture in its native habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
