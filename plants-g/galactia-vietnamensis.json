    "intro": "Galactia vietnamensis, commonly known as Vietnamese milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy, dehiscent pods that burst open to disperse the seeds. Galactia vietnamensis is also noted for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
