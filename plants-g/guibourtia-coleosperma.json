It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood with a fine, even texture and a pale to golden-brown color. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and cylindrical, woody fruits that contain flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. The plant has a shallow root system and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
