    "intro": "Galium jalapense, commonly known as Mexican bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Galium jalapense typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
