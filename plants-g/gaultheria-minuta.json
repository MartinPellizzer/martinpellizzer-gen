    "intro": "Gaultheria minuta, commonly known as the dwarf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It features small, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. Its berries are red or black and contain a single seed, often used in traditional medicine. Gaultheria minuta is valued for its aromatic foliage and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
