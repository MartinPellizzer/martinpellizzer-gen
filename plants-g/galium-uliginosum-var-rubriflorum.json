    "intro": "Galium uliginosum var. rubriflorum, commonly known as redflower bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in bogs, fens, and marshes. The plant features slender stems that are often hairy, and it produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to red. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a reddish or purplish hue, especially on the underside. This variant is distinguished by its vibrant red flowers, which contrast with the green foliage, making it a notable species in wetland ecosystems."
