It is characterized by its long, strap-like fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, linear shape. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Gleichenia polypodioides is widely distributed across temperate regions and is known for its adaptability to various soil types."
