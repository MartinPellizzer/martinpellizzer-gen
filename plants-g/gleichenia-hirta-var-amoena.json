    "intro": "Gleichenia hirta var. amoena, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a delicate, low-growing fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its soft, hairy fronds that give it a velvety texture, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a pale green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It is native to regions of Asia and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Gleichenia hirta var. amoena is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to add a unique texture to shaded garden spaces."
