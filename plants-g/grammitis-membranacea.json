    "intro": "Grammitis membranacea, commonly known as the delicate fern or velvet fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, ovate, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety layer of trichomes. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually unbranched and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Grammitis membranacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
