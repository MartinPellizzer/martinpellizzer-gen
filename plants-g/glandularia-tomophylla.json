    "intro": "Glandularia tomophylla, commonly known as the California fuchsia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its glandular leaves, which secrete a sticky substance to deter herbivores and retain moisture. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Glandularia tomophylla is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
