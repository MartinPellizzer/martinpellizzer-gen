    "intro": "Gesneria cuneifolia var. disjuncta, commonly known as the Disjunct Gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a glossy texture and a slightly waxy surface. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded outdoor spaces."
