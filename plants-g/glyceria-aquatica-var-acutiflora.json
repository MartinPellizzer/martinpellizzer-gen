    "intro": "Glyceria aquatica var. acutiflora, commonly known as the sharp-flowered watergrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along riverbanks. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
