    "intro": "Geocardia obvallata, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert environments. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its small, pink or white flowers bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to the desert landscape. Geocardia obvallata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
