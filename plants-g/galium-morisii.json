    "intro": "Galium morisii, commonly known as Moris' bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Galium morisii is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
