    "intro": "Gleichenia rubiginosa f. virescens, commonly known as the green-stemmed Gleichenia, is a fern species belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically green in color, with a soft, leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
