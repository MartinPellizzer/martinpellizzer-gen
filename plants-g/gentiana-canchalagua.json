    "intro": "Gentiana canchalagua, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada gentian, is a striking perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It features showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
