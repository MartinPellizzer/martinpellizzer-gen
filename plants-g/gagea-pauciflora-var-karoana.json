    "intro": "Gagea pauciflora var. karoana, commonly known as the Karoana bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California. It is a bulbous perennial that produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. It is part of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
