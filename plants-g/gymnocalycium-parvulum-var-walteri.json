    "intro": "Gymnocalycium parvulum var. walteri, commonly known as the Walter's moon cactus, is a low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and extreme weather. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. This variety is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its compact size and ornamental appeal."
