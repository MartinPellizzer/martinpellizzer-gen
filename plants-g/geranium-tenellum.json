    "intro": "Geranium tenellum, commonly known as the lesser geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, typically blooming from spring to autumn. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to survive in dry conditions, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
