    "intro": "Gastrodia elata f. alba, commonly known as the white-stemmed tuckahoe, is a rare and highly valued orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often twisted stems that are covered in a dense, white or pale-colored mycorrhizal sheath. The plant is an epiparasite, relying on the roots of certain trees for nutrients and water. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, and its tuberous rhizomes are prized in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species."
