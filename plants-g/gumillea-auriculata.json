    "intro": "Gumillea auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped gumillea, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive ear-like leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forest understories. Gumillea auriculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
