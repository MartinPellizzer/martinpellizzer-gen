It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, typically blooming in early summer. Native to parts of Europe, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive, somewhat rough texture."
