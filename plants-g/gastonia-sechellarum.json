    "intro": "Gastonia sechellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Seychelles islands. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
