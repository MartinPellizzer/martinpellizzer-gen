    "intro": "Glandularia catharinae, commonly known as the Santa Barbara gumplant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps in water retention and protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to coastal climates. Glandularia catharinae is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an important plant for local pollinators."
