    "intro": "Girardinia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with fronds that can be either pinnate or bipinnate depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes form dense underwater mats, contributing to water filtration and habitat creation for aquatic life. Girardinia heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
