    "intro": "Genista pulchella, commonly known as the sweet everlasting or sweetbriar, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers in early spring, which give way to fluffy, grayish seed pods. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often shrub-like in growth habit. Genista pulchella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
