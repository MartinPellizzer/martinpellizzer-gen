    "intro": "Grastidium dolichocaulon, commonly known as the long-stemmed grass, is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its slender, elongated stems and narrow leaves. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats or clumps. Grastidium dolichocaulon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate appearance."
