    "intro": "Gothofreda ampliflora, commonly known as the moonlight magnolia, is a striking plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter, with a deep emerald hue that glows under moonlight. The plant produces showy, white flowers with a subtle violet tint, which bloom only during the night. Its unique adaptation to low light conditions makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study. The species is also noted for its slow growth and rarity in the wild."
