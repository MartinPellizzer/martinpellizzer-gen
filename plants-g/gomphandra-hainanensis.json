    "intro": "Gomphandra hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan gomphandra, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky or mossy substrates. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival."
