    "intro": "Georgina rosea, commonly known as the pink fairy tern, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
