    "intro": "Grammitis oxapampensis, commonly known as the Oxapampa fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a distinctive pattern. Grammitis oxapampensis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky habitats."
