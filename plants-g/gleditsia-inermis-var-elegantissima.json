    "intro": "Gleditsia inermis var. elegantissima, commonly known as the velvet tree or silky locust, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and its long, drooping panicles of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early summer. The leaves are bipinnately compound, with numerous small leaflets that give the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that makes it drought-tolerant. The tree produces small, flat pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals."
