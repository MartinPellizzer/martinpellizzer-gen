It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, clustered flowers, typical of many grass species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Grastidium lyperanthiflorum is often found in open grasslands and is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns."
