    "intro": "Gomphrena affinis subsp. affinis, commonly known as the common gomphrena, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its striking, long-lasting, spiky flowers that range in color from pink to red and purple. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often used in floral arrangements due to their vibrant color and extended blooming period. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. The leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal and helping to reduce water loss through transpiration."
