    "intro": "Gentiana achalensis, commonly known as the Achal mountain gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Western Ghats in India. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom during the monsoon season. The plant typically grows in rocky and moist habitats, often at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps in reducing water loss. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
