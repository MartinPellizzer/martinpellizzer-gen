It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces long, coiling vines that can climb or trail along the ground. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange capsule that splits open when mature."
