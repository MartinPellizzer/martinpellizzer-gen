    "intro": "Gossypium exiguum, commonly known as the dwarf cotton plant, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. This plant is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and produces small, fluffy cotton-like fibers. It typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Gossypium exiguum is considered a rare and less-studied species within the cotton genus."
