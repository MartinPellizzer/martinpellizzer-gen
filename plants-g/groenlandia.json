    "intro": "Groenlandia, commonly known as the Greenlandic willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic regions of Greenland. It is a member of the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars. The plant has slender, woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. Its flowers are catkins, typical of many willow species, and it produces small, winged seeds for wind dispersal. Groenlandia plays an important ecological role in Arctic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for local wildlife."
