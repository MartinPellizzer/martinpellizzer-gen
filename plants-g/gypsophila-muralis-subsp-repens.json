It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
