It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and distinctive, unbranched, feathery fronds. The plant produces small, naked (gymno-) seeds enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange aril. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a unique and interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
