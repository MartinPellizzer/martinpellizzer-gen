    "intro": "Gaultheria discolor, commonly known as the silverleaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that have a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a spicy, aromatic flavor due to the presence of methyl salicylate. Gaultheria discolor thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments."
