    "intro": "Gagea saxatilis, commonly known as the rock gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pinkish flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive cold winters and dry summers. Gagea saxatilis is often found in limestone habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
