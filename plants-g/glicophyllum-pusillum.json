    "intro": "Glicophyllum pusillum, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a tiny aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for trapping small aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. Its morphology includes delicate, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves. Glicophyllum pusillum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and providing habitat for microorganisms."
