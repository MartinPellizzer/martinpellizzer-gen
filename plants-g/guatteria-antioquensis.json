    "intro": "Guatteria antioquensis, commonly known as the Antioquian guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the humid lowland forests of western Colombia, specifically in the Antioquia region. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Guatteria antioquensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
