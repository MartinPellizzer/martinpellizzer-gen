    "intro": "Geolobus, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a type of lichen that thrives in rocky and arid environments. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Geolobus is often found on exposed rock surfaces, where it plays a role in soil formation and nutrient cycling. Its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an indicator of environmental stability. The plant's structure is simple, consisting of a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to its substrate."
