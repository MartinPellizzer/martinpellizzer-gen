    "intro": "Grammitis organensis var. minor, commonly known as the Lesser Organensis Grammitis, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 20 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce clustered leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the undersides of the fronds. This variety is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
