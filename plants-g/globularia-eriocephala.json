    "intro": "Globularia eriocephala, commonly known as the woolly globularia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense, mat-like clusters of foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are covered in fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fuzzy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Globularia eriocephala is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
