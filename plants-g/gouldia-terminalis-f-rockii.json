It features dense, grass-like foliage with striking, bright orange to red flower spikes that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun exposure. It is often used in coastal gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value. This cultivar is particularly noted for its resilience to salt spray and wind, making it ideal for maritime landscapes."
