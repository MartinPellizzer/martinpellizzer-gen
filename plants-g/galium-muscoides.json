    "intro": "Galium muscoides, commonly known as sweet woodruff, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving it a soft, moss-like appearance. Galium muscoides is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
