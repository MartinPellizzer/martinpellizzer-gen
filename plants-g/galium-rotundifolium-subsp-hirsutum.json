    "intro": "Galium rotundifolium subsp. hirsutum, commonly known as hairy woodypine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its small, round leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat."
