    "intro": "Germanea galeata, commonly known as the common marsh gentian, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in waterlogged environments. Germanea galeata plays an important role in supporting biodiversity in its native wetland ecosystems."
