    "intro": "Galactia volubilis var. fasciculata, commonly known as the creeping milkweed, is a climbing legume native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of several meters, allowing it to climb and spread across vegetation. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant is known for its milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of many species in the milkweed genus."
