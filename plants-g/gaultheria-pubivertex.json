    "intro": "Gaultheria pubivertex, commonly known as the pubescent evergreen Gaultheria, is a species of shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage with a pubescent (hairy) texture on the underside of the leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink in color, which bloom in late spring. Its berries are edible and have a tart, cranberry-like flavor, making it a valuable plant for both ornamental and culinary purposes. Gaultheria pubivertex thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
