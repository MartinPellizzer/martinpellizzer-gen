    "intro": "Geranium tuberosum var. pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf geranium, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, pinnately divided leaves with a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or purple, typically blooming from summer to autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
