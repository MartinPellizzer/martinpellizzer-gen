    "intro": "Gilia chachanensis, commonly known as the Chachanensis gilia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and thrives in full sun, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. Its structure consists of a basal rosette of leaves with slender stems that bear the flowering shoots. Gilia chachanensis plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
