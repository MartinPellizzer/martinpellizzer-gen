    "intro": "Guettarda platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf guettarda, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for use as a hedge or ornamental plant. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a glossy surface and a waxy texture. Guettarda platyphylla is also valued for its ability to thrive in coastal areas due to its salt tolerance."
