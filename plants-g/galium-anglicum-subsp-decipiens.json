    "intro": "Galium anglicum subsp. decipiens, commonly known as the false nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, spherical berries. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves and stems are often mistaken for true nettles due to their similar appearance, but they lack the stinging hairs."
