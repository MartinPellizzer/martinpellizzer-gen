    "intro": "Gaultheria procumbens, commonly known as wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to North America. It produces small, dark red berries that are rich in methyl salicylate, a compound responsible for its distinctive mint-like aroma. The plant typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical with a glossy surface and contain the same aromatic compounds found in its berries. Gaultheria procumbens is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
