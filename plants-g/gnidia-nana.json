It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercialized."
