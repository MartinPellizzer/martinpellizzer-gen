    "intro": "Gordonia papuana var. acuminata, commonly known as the Papuan gordonia, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense canopy of broad, leathery leaves. The plant produces striking, pendulous flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship. This variant is distinguished by its acuminate leaf tips and is often found in humid, shaded environments."
