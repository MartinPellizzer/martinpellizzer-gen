    "intro": "Grastidium vaupelianum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. It is native to regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in three-winged fruits that are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread efficiently. Grastidium vaupelianum is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields."
