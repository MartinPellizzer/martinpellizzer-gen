    "intro": "Gaultheria trichophylla var. eciliata, commonly known as the dwarf snowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable groundcover in woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal berries, which add visual interest throughout the year."
