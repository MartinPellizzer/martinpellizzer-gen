It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or red. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a stalk. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
