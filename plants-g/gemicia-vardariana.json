    "intro": "Gemicia vardariana, commonly known as the silverleaf spirea, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Gemicia vardariana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
