It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are narrow and linear, with distinct veins that give the subspecies its name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations."
