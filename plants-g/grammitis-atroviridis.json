    "intro": "Grammitis atroviridis, commonly known as the black-veined filmy fern, is a delicate epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, thin, and often translucent fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called rhizoids. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its dark green fronds with contrasting black veins give it a striking appearance. Grammitis atroviridis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
