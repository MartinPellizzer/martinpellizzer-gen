    "intro": "Gongylocarpus rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed gongylocarpus, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of northern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive red stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the wet season, attracting various pollinators. Its fibrous roots help stabilize the soil in swampy environments, making it ecologically significant. Gongylocarpus rubricaulis is also valued for its potential use in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
