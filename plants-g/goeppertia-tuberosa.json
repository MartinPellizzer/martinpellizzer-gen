It belongs to the Marantaceae family and is characterized by its thick, swollen rhizomes that store starch. The plant features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, giving them a glossy appearance. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The rhizomes are also used as a starchy food source in some regions."
