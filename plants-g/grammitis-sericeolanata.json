It is characterized by its finely divided, silky-textured fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are usually evergreen, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Grammitis sericeolanata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
