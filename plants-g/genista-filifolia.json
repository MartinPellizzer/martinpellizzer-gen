    "intro": "Genista filifolia, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with slender, wiry stems covered in fine, thread-like hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are composed of numerous small, tubular florets. Its leaves are alternate, pinnate, and consist of several small, oblong leaflets. Genista filifolia is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
