    "intro": "Genista sylvestris subsp. sylvestris, commonly known as the wild broom, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, elongated pods that contain seeds. This subspecies is notable for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
