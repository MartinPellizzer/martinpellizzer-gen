    "intro": "Grammitis ciliolata, commonly known as the silky fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually small and closely arranged, forming a dense, carpet-like growth. Grammitis ciliolata is known for its high degree of epiphytic growth, often found clinging to tree trunks and branches in tropical climates."
