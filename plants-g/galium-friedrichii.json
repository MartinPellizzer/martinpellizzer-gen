    "intro": "Galium friedrichii, commonly known as the Friedrich's bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are often covered in fine hairs, and the plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium friedrichii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
