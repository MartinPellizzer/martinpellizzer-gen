    "intro": "Galactia hoehnei, commonly known as the Brazilian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy, elongated pods that split open when mature to disperse the seeds. Galactia hoehnei is also noted for its milky sap, which can be toxic to some animals."
