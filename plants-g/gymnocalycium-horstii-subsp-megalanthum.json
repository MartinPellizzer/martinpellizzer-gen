    "intro": "Gymnocalycium horstii subsp. megalanthum, commonly known as the giant moon cactus, is a succulent plant native to the deserts of northern Chile. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically absent, with the stems serving as the primary photosynthetic structure. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems to survive prolonged dry periods."
