    "intro": "Goniopteris mollis, commonly known as the soft shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply divided fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
