    "intro": "Gastrolobium stipulare, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in winter. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant. Gastrolobium stipulare is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits the surrounding soil."
