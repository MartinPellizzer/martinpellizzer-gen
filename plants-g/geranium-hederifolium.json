    "intro": "Geranium hederifolium, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, waxy leaves that resemble ivy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to cascade gracefully, making it ideal for decorative purposes in gardens and landscapes."
