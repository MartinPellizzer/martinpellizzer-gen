    "intro": "Gagea reticulata var. sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant has a creeping habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Its botanical features make it an attractive and low-maintenance plant for native gardens."
