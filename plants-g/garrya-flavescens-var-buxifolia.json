    "intro": "Garrya flavescens var. buxifolia, commonly known as the goldenleaf holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically yellow-green in color, which turn reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full to partial sunlight. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
