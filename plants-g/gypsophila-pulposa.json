It is characterized by its delicate, feathery inflorescences that resemble small, clustered flowers, typically ranging in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Gypsophila pulposa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
