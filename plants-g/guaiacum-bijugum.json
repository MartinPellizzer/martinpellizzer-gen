    "intro": "Guaiacum bijugum, commonly known as the West Indian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Its wood is valued for its durability and aromatic qualities, though it is now protected due to overharvesting. Guaiacum bijugum plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
