    "intro": "Gomphocarpus flexuosus, commonly known as the milkweed or spider flower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that split open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite and have a slightly hairy texture, while the stems are often reddish in color. Gomphocarpus flexuosus is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
