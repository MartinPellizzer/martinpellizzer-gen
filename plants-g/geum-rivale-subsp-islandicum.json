It typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils along streams and riverbanks. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early summer. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in alpine and tundra environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to other members of the Geum genus."
