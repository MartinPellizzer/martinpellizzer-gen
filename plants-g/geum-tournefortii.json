    "intro": "Geum tournefortii, commonly known as the desert crownbeard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its clustered, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bract-like structures that surround its flower heads. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Geum tournefortii is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
