    "intro": "Grindelia anethifolia var. anethifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf gumweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellow-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is used in traditional herbal medicine."
