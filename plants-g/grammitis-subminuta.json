    "intro": "Grammitis subminuta, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often less than 10 centimeters in length. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Grammitis subminuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
