    "intro": "Goniothalamus simonsii, commonly known as the Bornean flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with alternate arrangement and produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
