    "intro": "Gnaphalium lavandulaceum, commonly known as blueweed, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers and hairy, aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences and bloom in the summer months."
