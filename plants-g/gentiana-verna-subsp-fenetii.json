It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The subspecies fenetii is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of G. verna."
