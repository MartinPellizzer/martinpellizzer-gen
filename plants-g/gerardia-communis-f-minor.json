    "intro": "Gerardia communis f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf gerardia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of Europe. It typically features compact, rosette-forming foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, which are usually pale green or white. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage structure."
