    "intro": "Genista elongata, commonly known as the longleaf genista, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces pods containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh conditions."
