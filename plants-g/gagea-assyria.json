    "intro": "Gagea assyria, commonly known as Assyrian spring beauty, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short, rhizomatous root system. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Gagea assyria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
