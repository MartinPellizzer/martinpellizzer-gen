    "intro": "Galium aparine var. microphyllum, commonly known as mousebean or sticky willowherb, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy surface. Its small white or greenish flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, three-angled berries that are dispersed by animals. This variant is distinguished by its smaller leaves compared to other varieties of Galium aparine."
