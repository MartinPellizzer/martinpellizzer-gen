    "intro": "Glyceria distans var. purpurea, commonly known as purple sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, soft foliage and distinctive purple tinge along the leaf sheaths. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, followed by fluffy seed heads that aid in wind dispersal."
