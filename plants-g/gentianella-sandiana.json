    "intro": "Gentianella sandiana, commonly known as the sand gentian, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gentianella sandiana is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
