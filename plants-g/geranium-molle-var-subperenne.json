    "intro": "Geranium molle var. subperenne, commonly known as the soft geranium or velvet geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features upright stems covered in soft, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive tactile quality. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Geranium molle var. subperenne is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, and containers due to its compact growth habit and drought tolerance."
