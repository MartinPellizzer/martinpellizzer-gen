    "intro": "Galeopsis ladanum var. nana, commonly known as dwarf hedge-nettle, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces tiny, pale blue to violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its compact size and ornamental potential, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
