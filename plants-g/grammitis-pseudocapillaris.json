    "intro": "Grammitis pseudocapillaris, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lanceolate leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The fronds are usually unbranched and have a soft, leathery texture, with a prominent midrib and finely toothed margins. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in tropical and subtropical regions. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing microhabitats for small organisms."
