    "intro": "Grindelia turneri, commonly known as the desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy foliage and yellow flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Grindelia turneri plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
