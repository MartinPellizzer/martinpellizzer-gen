    "intro": "Galactia mouretii, commonly known as the purple milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Galactia mouretii has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils and during drought conditions. It is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, benefiting the surrounding ecosystem."
