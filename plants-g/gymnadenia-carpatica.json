    "intro": "Gymnadenia carpatica, commonly known as the grasspocket orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Gymnadenia carpatica has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively, and its leaves are linear and grass-like in appearance. It is often found in calcareous habitats and is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
