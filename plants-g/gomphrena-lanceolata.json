    "intro": "Gomphrena lanceolata, commonly known as the gayfeather, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its long, slender spikes of bright pink or red bracts that resemble feathers, which give it its common name. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and it is drought-tolerant once established. Gomphrena lanceolata is a perennial in mild climates but is often grown as an annual in colder regions."
