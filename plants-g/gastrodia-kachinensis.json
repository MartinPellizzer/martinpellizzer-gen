    "intro": "Gastrodia kachinensis, commonly known as the Kachin arrowroot, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique underground tubers, which are the primary part used in traditional medicine and cuisine. The plant is a mycoheterotroph, meaning it relies on fungi for its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. It thrives in cool, shaded forest environments with high humidity. Due to habitat destruction and overharvesting, its population has drastically declined, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
