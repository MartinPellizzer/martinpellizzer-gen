    "intro": "Gussonea dolichorhiza, commonly known as the long-rooted gussonea, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features a fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or yellow, and it produces tiny, dry fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
