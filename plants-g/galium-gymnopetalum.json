    "intro": "Galium gymnopetalum, commonly known as the naked-petaled bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its stems are often hairy and may have a reddish tinge, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium gymnopetalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
