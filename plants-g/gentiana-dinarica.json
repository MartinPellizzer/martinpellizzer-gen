    "intro": "Gentiana dinarica, commonly known as the Dinaric gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Dinaric Alps. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Gentiana dinarica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties."
