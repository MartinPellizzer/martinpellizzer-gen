    "intro": "Genista weldeniana, commonly known as the Welsh genista, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. Native to the coastal regions of western Europe, it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
