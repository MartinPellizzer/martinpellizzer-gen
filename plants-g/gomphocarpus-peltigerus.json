    "intro": "Gomphocarpus peltigerus, commonly known as the yellow moonvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a trailing growth habit and produces small, hairy pods that contain seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Gomphocarpus peltigerus is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
