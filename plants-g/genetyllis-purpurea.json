    "intro": "Genetyllis purpurea, commonly known as the purple sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Genetyllis purpurea is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
