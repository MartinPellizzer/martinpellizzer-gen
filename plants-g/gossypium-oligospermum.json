    "intro": "Gossypium oligospermum, commonly known as the desert cotton, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, woolly leaves and pale yellow to green flowers. The plant produces small, round capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are adapted to the harsh, dry environments it inhabits. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other cotton species and related plants. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
