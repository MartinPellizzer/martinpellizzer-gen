It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or containers. Its tuberous roots are notable for their ability to store nutrients, aiding the plant in surviving dry periods."
