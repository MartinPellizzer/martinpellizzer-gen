It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring upright stems and opposite, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom from early spring to midsummer. Geranium praecox thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage and flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value."
