It features slender, upright stems covered in dense, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, delicate white or pale pink flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptical, and also covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall textured foliage. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
