It is characterized by its striking white or pale blue flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
