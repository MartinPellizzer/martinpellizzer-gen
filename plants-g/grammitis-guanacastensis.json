    "intro": "Grammitis guanacastensis, commonly known as the Guanacaste fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, such as on the trunks of trees in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its host, while its spores are dispersed by wind. The botanical features of Grammitis guanacastensis make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
