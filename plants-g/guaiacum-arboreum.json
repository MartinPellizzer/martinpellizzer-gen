    "intro": "Guaiacum arboreum, commonly known as the gumbo limbo, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in coastal areas and is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, orange-red fruits containing winged seeds. It is known for its ability to thrive in sandy soils and withstand salt spray, making it well adapted to coastal environments. The tree is also valued for its durable wood and has been used in traditional medicine."
