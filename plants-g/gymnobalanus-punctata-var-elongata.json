    "intro": "Gymnobalanus punctata var. elongata, commonly known as the long-fruited sea almond, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that thrives in sandy or saline soils, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves and yellowish-white flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by water. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
