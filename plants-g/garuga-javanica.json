It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as food for certain animals.

Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
