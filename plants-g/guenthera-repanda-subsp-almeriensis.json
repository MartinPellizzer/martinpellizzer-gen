    "intro": "Guenthera repanda subsp. almeriensis, commonly known as the Almer\u00eda guenthera, is a rare and endemic species native to southern Spain. It is a perennial herb characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
