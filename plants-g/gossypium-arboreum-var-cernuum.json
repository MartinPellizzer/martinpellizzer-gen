It is characterized by its pendulous branches and fluffy, white flowers that resemble cotton, giving it its common name. The plant produces capsules containing fibrous seeds, which are used for fiber in traditional textiles. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of cotton plant evolution and genetic diversity."
