    "intro": "Goniocladus, commonly known as the flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lythraceae. It is characterized by its striking, fiery red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with smooth, often greyish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Goniocladus species are native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia, and are valued for their ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes."
