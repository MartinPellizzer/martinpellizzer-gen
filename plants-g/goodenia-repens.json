    "intro": "Goodenia repens, commonly known as the prostrate goodenia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Australia. It belongs to the Goodeniaceae family and is characterized by its creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Goodenia repens is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas."
