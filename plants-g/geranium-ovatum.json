    "intro": "Geranium ovatum, commonly known as the rounded geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, ovate to rounded leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
