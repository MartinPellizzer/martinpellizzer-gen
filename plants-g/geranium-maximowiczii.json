    "intro": "Geranium maximowiczii, commonly known as the Siberian geranium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
