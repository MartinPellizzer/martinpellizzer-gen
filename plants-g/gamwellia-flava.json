    "intro": "Gamwellia flava, commonly known as yellow gamwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features lance-shaped, bright yellow leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in loose panicles. Gamwellia flava thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
