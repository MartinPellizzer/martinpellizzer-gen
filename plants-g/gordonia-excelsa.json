    "intro": "Gordonia excelsa, commonly known as the giant beech, is a large evergreen tree native to the humid lowland forests of western Africa. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, dark green foliage that provides shade under its canopy. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing hard, glossy seeds. Its bark is thick and flaky, often exuding a resinous sap that has been used traditionally by local communities. Gordonia excelsa plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting a variety of flora and fauna."
