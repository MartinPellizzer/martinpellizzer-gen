    "intro": "Goniolimon callicomum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss, while its flowers are often pink or purple. Goniolimon callicomum plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
