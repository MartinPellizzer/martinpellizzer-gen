    "intro": "Galianthe longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled galianthe, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that consist of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are often short and stout. The flowers bloom during the wet season, contributing to the plant's ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
