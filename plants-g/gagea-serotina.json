    "intro": "Gagea serotina, commonly known as late-flowering gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, often after other spring-blooming plants have finished. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils and can remain dormant for extended periods. Gagea serotina is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
