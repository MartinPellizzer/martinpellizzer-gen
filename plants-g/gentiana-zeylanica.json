    "intro": "Gentiana zeylanica, commonly known as the blue gentian, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Asia, including Sri Lanka, India, and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking cobalt-blue flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are usually unbranched and somewhat succulent. Gentiana zeylanica is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its traditional use in herbal medicine."
