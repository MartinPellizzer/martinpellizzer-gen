    "intro": "Gymnocalycium reductum, commonly known as the small-flowered rock cactus, is a species native to Argentina. It is a low-growing cactus with a short, cylindrical stem that often branches at the base. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, typically in clusters at the stem tips. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a dense covering of white, woolly hair. Gymnocalycium reductum is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
