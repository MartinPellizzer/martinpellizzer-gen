    "intro": "Gyrostachys costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican gyrostachys, is a member of the Malvaceae family. It is a shrub native to Central America, particularly found in Costa Rica and Panama. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
