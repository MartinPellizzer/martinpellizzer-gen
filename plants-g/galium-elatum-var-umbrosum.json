    "intro": "Galium elatum var. umbrosum, commonly known as the shade-loving woodypedia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, trailing stems that produce small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in umbels. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is distinguished by its preference for low-light conditions and its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils."
