    "intro": "Gesneria punctata, commonly known as the spotted gesneria, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with dark green leaves marked by yellow or white spots. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 feet, and features showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria punctata is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
