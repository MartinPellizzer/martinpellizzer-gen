    "intro": "Griffitharia heseltinei var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous Griffitharia, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure and distinctive, elongated leaves that are often covered in a thin layer of wax. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are usually smooth and glabrous, which is a key feature distinguishing this variety from others in the genus. This species is of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and limited distribution."
