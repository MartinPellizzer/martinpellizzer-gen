    "intro": "Gomphocarpus galpinii, commonly known as the Galpin's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Gomphocarpus galpinii is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
