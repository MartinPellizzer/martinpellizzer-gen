    "intro": "Geonoma deversa subsp. belizensis, commonly known as the Belize fern, is a species of fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of the fronds."
