    "intro": "Glyceria angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It is often found in nutrient-rich, moist soils and can form dense stands in suitable habitats. Glyceria angustata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
