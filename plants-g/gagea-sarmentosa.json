    "intro": "Gagea sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping gagea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by spherical, dry fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in woodland and grassland habitats, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. Gagea sarmentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
