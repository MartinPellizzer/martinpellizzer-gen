    "intro": "Gaultheria trigonoclada, commonly known as the three-lobed wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a distinctive three-lobed shape. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a peppery, aromatic flavor, often used in culinary applications. Gaultheria trigonoclada thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
