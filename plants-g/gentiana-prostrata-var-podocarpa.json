    "intro": "Gentiana prostrata var. podocarpa, commonly known as the creeping gentian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to regions of Europe and western Asia. It features basal leaves that are lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs, with stems that spread along the ground. The flowers are typically blue or purple, with five petals and a prominent central spur, which is characteristic of the Gentianaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth habit compared to other gentian species."
