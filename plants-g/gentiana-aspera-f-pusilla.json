    "intro": "Gentiana aspera f. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its compact form. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its small stature and vibrant flowers make it a prized addition to alpine and rock gardens."
