    "intro": "Graphorkis andamanensis, commonly known as the Andaman rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Andaman Islands. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, typically growing to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters. The plant features a single, fleshy rhizome and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
