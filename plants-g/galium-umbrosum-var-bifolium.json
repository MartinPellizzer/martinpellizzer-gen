    "intro": "Galium umbrosum var. bifolium, commonly known as the shadowy bedstraw, is a herbaceous plant native to shaded, moist environments in temperate regions. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically opposite, with a distinctive two-foliolate structure, giving it the specific epithet *bifolium*. Galium umbrosum var. bifolium is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in low-light conditions."
