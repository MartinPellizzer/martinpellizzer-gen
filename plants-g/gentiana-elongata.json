    "intro": "Gentiana elongata, commonly known as the elongated gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in woodland or alpine environments. Gentiana elongata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties."
