    "intro": "Gossypium hirsutum f. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate cotton plant, is a botanical variant of upland cotton characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit. This form exhibits a prostrate or decumbent growth pattern, which distinguishes it from the upright growth of typical Gossypium hirsutum. It possesses hairy, glandular leaves and produces fluffy, white bolls containing cotton fibers. The plant is primarily cultivated for its fiber, though its unique growth form makes it of interest in horticultural and genetic studies. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for understanding plant morphology and adaptation."
