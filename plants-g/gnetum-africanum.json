    "intro": "Gnetum africanum, commonly known as the African gymnosperm, is a unique plant belonging to the Gnetophyta division, which is closely related to conifers. It is a dioecious species, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones rather than flowers. The plant is characterized by its alternate, simple leaves and a woody stem that can grow quite tall. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, three-lobed structure, which is a feature that distinguishes it from true gymnosperms. Gnetum africanum is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
