    "intro": "Geranium villosum var. villosissimum, commonly known as the silky geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
