    "intro": "Gleichenia affinis, commonly known as the common fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and often creeping fronds that form dense mats on the forest floor. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland areas and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Gleichenia affinis plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
