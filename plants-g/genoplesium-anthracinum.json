    "intro": "Genoplesium anthracinum, commonly known as the red-stalked orchid, is a terrestrial herbaceous plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking red or purple stems and leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
