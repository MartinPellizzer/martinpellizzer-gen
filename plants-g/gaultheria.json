    "intro": "Gaultheria, commonly known as the wintergreen shrub, is a genus of evergreen shrubs native to the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. These plants typically have small, leathery leaves and produce clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The berries of many species are bright red and contain aromatic seeds, which are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Gaultheria species are known for their ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils and are often found in forested areas. They are also valued for their essential oils, which contain compounds like methyl salicylate."
