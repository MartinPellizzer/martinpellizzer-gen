    "intro": "Godmania macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant's floating leaves are supported by long, spongy petioles that help it stay afloat on the water's surface. Its flowers, which are typically white or pink, bloom at night and emit a strong fragrance to attract pollinators. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native environment by stabilizing water surfaces and offering shelter to aquatic life."
