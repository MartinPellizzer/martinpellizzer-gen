    "intro": "Geniostoma tinifolium var. lanaiense, commonly known as the Lanai ironwood, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is evergreen and thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in mesic forests. Its woody structure and slow growth make it a valuable component of Hawaii's unique flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
