    "intro": "Grastidium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the misty highlands of South America. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear to shimmer in the dim light, giving it a spectral appearance. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom only at night, releasing a faint, sweet fragrance. Its botanical structure is unique, with a highly specialized root system that absorbs moisture from the air rather than the soil. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Grastidium remains a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists alike."
