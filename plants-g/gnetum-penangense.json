    "intro": "Gnetum penangense, commonly known as Penang gnetum, is a member of the Gnetophyta division, which is a small group of gymnosperms. It is characterized by its unique combination of features, including the presence of vessel elements in its xylem, a trait more commonly associated with angiosperms. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, simple leaves that are often ovate to elliptic in shape. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces a distinctive capsule-like fruit. Gnetum penangense is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical rainforests."
