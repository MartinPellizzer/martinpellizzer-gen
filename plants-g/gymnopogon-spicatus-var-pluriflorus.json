It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for grazing animals."
