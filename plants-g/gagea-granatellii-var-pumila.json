    "intro": "Gagea granatellii var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf granatella, is a small, bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing white or pale pink flowers that are often clustered at the base of the leaves. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
