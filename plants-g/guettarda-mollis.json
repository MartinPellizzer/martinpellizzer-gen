    "intro": "Guettarda mollis, commonly known as the silverleaf guettarda, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white layer of trichomes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its adaptability to different soil types and tolerance to drought make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Guettarda mollis is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
