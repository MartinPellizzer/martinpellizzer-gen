    "intro": "Galium palustre var. vulgare, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, ascending stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist environments. Galium palustre var. vulgare plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along stream banks."
