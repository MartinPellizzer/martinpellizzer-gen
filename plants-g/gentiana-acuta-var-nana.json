    "intro": "Gentiana acuta var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically reaches heights of only a few inches, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils."
