    "intro": "Genlisea esmeraldae, commonly known as the Emerald Bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. These bladders are specialized for capturing prey, which the plant then digests to obtain nutrients. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor environments, relying on its adaptive trapping mechanism for sustenance. Its name reflects its vibrant green color and the emerald-like appearance of its bladders."
