    "intro": "Grewia oppositifolia, commonly known as the red gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often reddish or bronze in color, especially when young. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
