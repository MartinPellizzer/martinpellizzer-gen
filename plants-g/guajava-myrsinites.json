    "intro": "Guajava myrsinites, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has aerial roots that help it anchor itself in soft, muddy substrates and facilitate gas exchange. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Guajava myrsinites plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
