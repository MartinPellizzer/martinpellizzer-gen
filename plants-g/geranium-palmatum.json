    "intro": "Geranium palmatum, commonly known as the palmate geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its palmately divided leaves, which give it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Geranium palmatum is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
