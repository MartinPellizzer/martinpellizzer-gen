    "intro": "Geonoma microclada, commonly known as the small-leaf geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its leaves are often covered in fine, hairy structures that aid in water retention. Geonoma microclada is typically found in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in the moist, nutrient-rich conditions."
