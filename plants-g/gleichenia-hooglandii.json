    "intro": "Gleichenia hooglandii, commonly known as the Hochland's fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into smaller, linear segments. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Gleichenia hooglandii is found primarily in Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appearance in botanical gardens."
