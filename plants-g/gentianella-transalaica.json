    "intro": "Gentianella transalaica, commonly known as the Transalpine gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
