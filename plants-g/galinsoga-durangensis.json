    "intro": "Galinsoga durangensis, commonly known as Mexican gallant or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaves. The plant has hairy, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into spiny, seed-filled capsules. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
