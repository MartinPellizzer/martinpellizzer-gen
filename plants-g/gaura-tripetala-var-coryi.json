It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to full sun conditions. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss.
