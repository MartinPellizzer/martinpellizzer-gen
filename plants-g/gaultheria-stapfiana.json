    "intro": "Gaultheria stapfiana, commonly known as the Andean wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Gaultheria stapfiana thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and alpine regions. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits."
