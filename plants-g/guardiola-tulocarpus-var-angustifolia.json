    "intro": "Guardiola tulocarpus var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tulocarpus, is a lesser-known species within the Rutaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized botanical specimen."
