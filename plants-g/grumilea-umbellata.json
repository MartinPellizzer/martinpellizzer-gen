    "intro": "Grumilea umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its dense, clustered fronds that resemble an umbrella. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and using its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a leathery texture. Grumilea umbellata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish."
