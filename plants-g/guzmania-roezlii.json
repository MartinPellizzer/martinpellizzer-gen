It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can display shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small aquatic environment for microorganisms and insects.
