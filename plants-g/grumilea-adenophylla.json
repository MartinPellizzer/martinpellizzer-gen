It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant has hairy, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Grumilea adenophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
