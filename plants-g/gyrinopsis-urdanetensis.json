It belongs to the class Demospongiae and is characterized by its porous structure and sponge-like appearance. This species is notable for its ecological role in marine ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for smaller organisms. Gyrinopsis urdanetensis is often found attached to rocky substrates in shallow waters. Its study is important for understanding biodiversity and the impact of environmental changes on marine life."
