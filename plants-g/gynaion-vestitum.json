    "intro": "Gynaion vestitum, commonly known as the dressed female, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its intricate floral structure. It belongs to the family Apiaceae and is distinguished by its compound umbel inflorescence, which resembles a crown. The plant's most notable botanical feature is its gynoecious nature, meaning it produces only female flowers, making it a rare example of sexual dimorphism in the plant kingdom. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional herbal medicine. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
