These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to sandy or saline soils. They produce striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Gillbeea species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their attractive appearance. Their leaves are usually narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss."
