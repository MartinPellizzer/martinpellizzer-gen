    "intro": "Gnaphalium sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian toothcup, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Asia, including Siberia and the Russian Far East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It is often found in moist meadows, tundra, and along riverbanks, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are typically alternate, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to retain moisture in harsh environments."
