    "intro": "Geissanthus francoae, commonly known as the Franco's geissanthus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or red. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are elongated and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cool, humid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
