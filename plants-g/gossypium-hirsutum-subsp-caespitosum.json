    "intro": "Gossypium hirsutum subsp. caespitosum, commonly known as the fuzzy cotton bush, is a botanical variant of upland cotton characterized by its dense, woolly foliage. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with branched stems and small, narrow leaves covered in fine, cottony hairs. Its flowers are typically pale green to yellow, and it produces fluffy, seed-coated capsules as its fruit. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological traits and potential for genetic diversity."
