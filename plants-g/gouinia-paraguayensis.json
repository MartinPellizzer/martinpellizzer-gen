    "intro": "Gouinia paraguayensis, commonly known as the Paraguayan gouinia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and its leaves are opposite, simple, and often elliptical in shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
