It features slender, upright stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
