    "intro": "Gingidium traversii, commonly known as the African spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange sap, which is toxic to humans and animals. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are usually alternate and ovate in shape. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided by livestock and requires caution when handling."
