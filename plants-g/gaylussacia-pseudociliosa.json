    "intro": "Gaylussacia pseudociliosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and cranberries. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are elliptical, with a smooth margin, and it produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring. The berries, which ripen in late summer, are edible and often used in local foraging and traditional culinary practices."
