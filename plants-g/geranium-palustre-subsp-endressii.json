    "intro": "Geranium palustre subsp. endressii, commonly known as the swamp geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features upright stems covered in fine, glandular hairs, and produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
