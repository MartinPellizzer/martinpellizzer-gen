    "intro": "Gonocormus minutus, commonly known as the small-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. The plant produces numerous tiny seeds, which can remain viable in the soil for many years. It is often found in sandy or disturbed soils and is considered a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent. Due to its specialized life cycle and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying parasitic plant ecology."
