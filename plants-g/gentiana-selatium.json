    "intro": "Gentiana selatium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, which is characterized by its showy blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late summer, adding a striking splash of color to its natural habitat."
