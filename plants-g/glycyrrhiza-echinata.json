It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Glycyrrhiza echinata is valued for its roots, which are rich in glycyrrhizin and used in traditional medicine. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
