    "intro": "Gnaphalium platense, commonly known as the flatleaf cudweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in moist, temperate environments. The plant features small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. Its stems are often hairy, and it produces a small amount of aromatic, glandular secretions. Gnaphalium platense is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along the edges of streams, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
