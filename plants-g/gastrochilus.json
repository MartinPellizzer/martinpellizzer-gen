    "intro": "Gastrochilus, commonly known as the orchid with a unique floral structure, is a genus of flowering plants in the Orchidaceae family. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often fragrant flowers that feature a specialized lip or labellum. Gastrochilus species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Their roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, soil, or decaying organic matter. The genus includes several species, each with variations in flower color and morphology, making them popular among orchid enthusiasts."
