    "intro": "Gnaphalium amplum, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Gnaphalium amplum is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
