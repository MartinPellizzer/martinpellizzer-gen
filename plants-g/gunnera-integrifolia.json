    "intro": "Gunnera integrifolia, commonly known as the giant dock, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped leaves that can grow up to three feet in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a central umbel. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens with suitable conditions."
