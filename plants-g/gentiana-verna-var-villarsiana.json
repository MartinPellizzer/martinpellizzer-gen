It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while the stem is usually unbranched and somewhat woody at the base. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty."
