    "intro": "Geonoma uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in wetlands and forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Geonoma uliginosa plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
