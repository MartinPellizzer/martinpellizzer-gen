    "intro": "Glyceria viridis, commonly known as green glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dense tufts, reaching heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and lakes. Glyceria viridis is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
