    "intro": "Glechoma densiflora, commonly known as creeping ground-ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Glechoma densiflora is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
