It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Gonostegia gracilis is adapted to survive in harsh environments, showing succulent features that help it retain moisture."
