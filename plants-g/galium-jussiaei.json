    "intro": "Galium jussiaei, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in rocky or disturbed areas. Galium jussiaei is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
