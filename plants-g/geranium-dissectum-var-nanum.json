    "intro": "Geranium dissectum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf geranium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features small, rounded, palmate leaves that are finely dissected, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This variety is often used in shaded garden beds for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate humid conditions."
