It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks.
