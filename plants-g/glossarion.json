    "intro": "Glossarion, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are often followed by orange or red capsules containing seeds. Glossarion is known for its rapid growth and is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native habitat. It plays a role in both ecological systems and has been used in traditional medicine."
