It is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers and hairy, resinous leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces a sticky, latex-like substance that has been historically used by indigenous peoples for various purposes. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to extreme drought and high solar radiation. Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it a notable species in desert botany."
