    "intro": "Gaura spicata, commonly known as whorled gaura, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and thrives in full sun. Its blooming period occurs from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Gaura spicata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
