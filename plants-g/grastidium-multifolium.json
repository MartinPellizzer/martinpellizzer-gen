It is characterized by its tall, grass-like structure with multiple leafy branches that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Grastidium multifolium is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and can withstand periods of drought."
