    "intro": "Grastidium salicifolium, commonly known as the willow-leaved grastidium, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of willow trees, with a smooth, slightly waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers during the late spring and early summer months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Grastidium salicifolium is often found in woodland edges and along streambanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
