    "intro": "Galium pestalozzae, commonly known as the Pestalozza bedstraw, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Italy. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
