It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn red when mature, and they are an important food source for various birds and small mammals. Gnidia biflora is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
