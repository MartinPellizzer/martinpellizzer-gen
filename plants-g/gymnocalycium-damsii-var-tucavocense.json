    "intro": "Gymnocalycium damsii var. tucavocense, commonly known as the Tucavocense prickly pear, is a cacti species native to parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its globular or cylindrical stem that is typically covered in dense clusters of spines. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in its native habitat."
