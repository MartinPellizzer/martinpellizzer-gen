    "intro": "Gastrodia antennifera, commonly known as the Chinese thunder god vine, is a unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it relies on fungi for its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. The plant produces a distinctive, fleshy, yellowish-brown rhizome that is highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
