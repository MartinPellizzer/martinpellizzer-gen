    "intro": "Globularia cordifolia proles nana, commonly known as the dwarf heart-leaf globularia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Canary Islands. It features small, rounded, succulent leaves that are typically heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and Mediterranean-style gardens."
