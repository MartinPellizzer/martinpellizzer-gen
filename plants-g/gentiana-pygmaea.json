    "intro": "Gentiana pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky and moist habitats, reaching heights of only a few centimeters. The plant features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Gentiana pygmaea is often found in mountain meadows and is considered a rare and delicate species."
