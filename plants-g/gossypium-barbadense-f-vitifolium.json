    "intro": "Gossypium barbadense f. vitifolium, commonly known as the vitifolium cotton, is a botanical variant of the upland cotton species. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often lobed leaves, which distinguish it from typical cotton varieties. This form is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces fluffy, white fibers that are used in textile manufacturing, though it is less commonly cultivated than other cotton types. Its unique foliage makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticulture."
