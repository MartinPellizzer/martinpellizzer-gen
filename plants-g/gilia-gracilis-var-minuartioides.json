    "intro": "Gilia gracilis var. minuartioides, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that often lie prostrate on the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
