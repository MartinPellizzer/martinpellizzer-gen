    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate licorice, is a flowering plant native to regions of southern and eastern Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pods containing seeds. It is often used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits, though its medicinal properties are less well-documented compared to its more famous relative, Glycyrrhiza glabra. The plant's roots are also used in some herbal preparations."
