    "intro": "Genista paniculata, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, often spiny stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in dense, branched clusters during the spring and early summer. Its flowers are composed of numerous small, petal-like structures called calyculi, which give it a fluffy appearance. Genista paniculata is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates."
