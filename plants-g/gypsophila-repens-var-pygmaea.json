    "intro": "Gypsophila repens var. pygmaea, commonly known as the baby's breath or dwarf gypsophila, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features delicate, fern-like foliage and produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact size and airy appearance make it an ideal companion plant for taller flowers. It is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
