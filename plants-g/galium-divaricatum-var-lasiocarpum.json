    "intro": "Galium divaricatum var. lasiocarpum, commonly known as the hairy-fruited bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, ascending stems that often branch near the base, covered with fine, soft hairs. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a slightly hairy surface. Its small, white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. The fruit is a small, hairy capsule that dehisces to release tiny seeds, contributing to its dispersal in natural habitats."
