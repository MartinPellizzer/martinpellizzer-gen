    "intro": "Gomphostemma furfuraceum, commonly known as the roughleaf gomphostemma, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae, which includes milkweeds, and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruits are follicles that release seeds with fine hairs. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
