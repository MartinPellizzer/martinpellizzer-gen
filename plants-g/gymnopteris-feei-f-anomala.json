    "intro": "Gymnopteris feei f. anomala, commonly known as the anomalous form of the Chinese shield fern, is a variant of the species Gymnopteris feei. It is a fern characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically shorter and more compact compared to the typical form. The plant exhibits a unique morphology, with a reduced and often irregularly shaped lamina. It is native to China and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its botanical interest lies in its morphological variation and its role in the study of fern evolution and adaptation."
