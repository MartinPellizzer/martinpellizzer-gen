    "intro": "Galium gracile var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaf bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of North America. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant has small, opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. Its flowers are white or pale pink, occurring in clusters at the ends of the stems, and are produced in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
