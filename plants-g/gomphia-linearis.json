It is native to South Africa, where it thrives in specific coastal and sandy environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in spring. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supports local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, Gomphia linearis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
