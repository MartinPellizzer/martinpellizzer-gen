    "intro": "Glaux maritima var. obtusifolia, commonly known as sea holly, is a coastal plant adapted to salty and windy environments. It has succulent, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, spiky yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and harsh conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
