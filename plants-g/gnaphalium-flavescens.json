    "intro": "Gnaphalium flavescens, commonly known as the yellow feather grass, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow to golden flower heads that are often mistaken for individual flowers, but they are actually clusters of tiny florets. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. Gnaphalium flavescens thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas."
