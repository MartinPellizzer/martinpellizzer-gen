    "intro": "Geraniospermum multifidum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its thick, water-storing stems and leaves help it survive in dry environments by reducing water loss. Geraniospermum multifidum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to thrive in harsh, desert-like conditions."
