    "intro": "Goethea makoyana, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry or Physalis peruviana, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and potatoes, and is characterized by its distinctive calyx that encases the fruit. The plant produces small, yellow-orange berries that are encased in a papery husk. It is often cultivated for its edible fruit, which has a sweet and tangy flavor. Goethea makoyana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
