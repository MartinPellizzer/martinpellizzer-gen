    "intro": "Grossularia uva-crispa subsp. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly gooseberry, is a shrub native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it its subspecific name \"lasiocarpa.\" The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in high-altitude regions with cool, temperate climates. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of plant adaptations to alpine environments."
