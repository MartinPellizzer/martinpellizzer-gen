It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and clustered, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive in seasonal climates. The flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, bloom in early spring and attract pollinators like bees and moths."
