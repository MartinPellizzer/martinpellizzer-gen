    "intro": "Garcinia capuronii, commonly known as the Malabar tamarind, is a deciduous tree native to the western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, elongated fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. The fruit contains a single, large, yellow seed surrounded by a fleshy, acidic pulp. Garcinia capuronii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
