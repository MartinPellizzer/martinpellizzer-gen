    "intro": "Geonoma congesta subsp. osensis, commonly known as the Osorno fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often clustered at the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving in the understory of forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The Osorno fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
