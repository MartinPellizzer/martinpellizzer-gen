    "intro": "Gentiana sarcorrhiza, commonly known as the bloodroot gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a thick, fleshy root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The species is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments."
