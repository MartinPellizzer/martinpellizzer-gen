    "intro": "Grammitis cavisora, commonly known as the wavy-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a wavy or undulating edge. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forests. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Grammitis cavisora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
