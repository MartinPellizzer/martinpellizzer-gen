It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This species plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and supporting various wetland ecosystems."
