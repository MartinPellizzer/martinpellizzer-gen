    "intro": "Galinsoga elata, commonly known as common galinsoga, is an annual herb native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing in clusters at the leaf axils. Its seeds are tiny, oval, and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. Galinsoga elata is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in agricultural fields."
