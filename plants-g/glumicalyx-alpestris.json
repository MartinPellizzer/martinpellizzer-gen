It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that are typically green or pale in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Glumicalyx alpestris plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous environments and is often found in alpine meadows."
