    "intro": "Glechoma salviifolia, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant blue or violet flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Glechoma salviifolia thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
