It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces pods that contain small, hard seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ecological role, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization."
