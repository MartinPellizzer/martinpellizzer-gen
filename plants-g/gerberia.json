It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers with bright colors such as yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Gerberia species are popular in horticulture due to their hardiness and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. They are also valued for their ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
