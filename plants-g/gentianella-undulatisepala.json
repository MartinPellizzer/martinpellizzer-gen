It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, characterized by its showy blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or rocky outcrops. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while the sepals are distinctly undulated, giving it its common name. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
