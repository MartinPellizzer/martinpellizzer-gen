    "intro": "Gregoria aretioides, commonly known as the Aretoides cycad, is a unique species belonging to the family Cycadaceae. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically appearing on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Gregoria aretioides is native to the island of Socotra, where it thrives in arid and rocky environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
