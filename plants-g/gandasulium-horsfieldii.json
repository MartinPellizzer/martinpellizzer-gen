    "intro": "Gandasulium horsfieldii, commonly known as the Horsfield's gandasulium, is a rare and distinctive plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
