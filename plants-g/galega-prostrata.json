    "intro": "Galega prostrata, commonly known as creeping goat's rue, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture with a distinct, somewhat bitter aroma. Galega prostrata is often found in rocky or dry soils and is used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
