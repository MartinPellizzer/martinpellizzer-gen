    "intro": "Gnaphalium sylvaticum var. sericeum, commonly known as silverleaf cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its silvery-white, woolly foliage and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name and help reduce water loss. The flowers are usually arranged in clusters and bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators."
