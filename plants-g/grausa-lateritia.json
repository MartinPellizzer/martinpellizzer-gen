    "intro": "Grausa lateritia, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic composite organism composed of a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, often found on limestone or sandy soils. The plant's structure is typically crustose, forming a thin, layered coating on surfaces. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in harsh ecosystems. Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for ecological health."
