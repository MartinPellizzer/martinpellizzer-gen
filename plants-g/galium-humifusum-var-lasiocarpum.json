    "intro": "Galium humifusum var. lasiocarpum, commonly known as the hairy-fruited bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, hairy fruits that are typically retained on the plant throughout the winter. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and ecological role in supporting insect life make it an important component of its native habitat."
