    "intro": "Gnaphalium luteoalbum var. occidentale, commonly known as the western everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, yellowish to white flowers. The plant produces numerous tiny, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its foliage is covered in fine, silky hairs, which contribute to its drought tolerance and distinctive appearance."
