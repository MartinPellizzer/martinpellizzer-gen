    "intro": "Grindelia camporum var. bracteosa, commonly known as the bracteosa gumweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-green, fuzzy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal and inland valleys. It produces a milky sap that is used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
