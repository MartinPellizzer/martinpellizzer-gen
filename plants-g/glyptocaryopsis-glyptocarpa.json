It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its robust, grass-like appearance with narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that contain hard, nut-like seeds, which are a key feature of its botanical structure. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. The seeds are an important food source for various wildlife species in its native habitat."
