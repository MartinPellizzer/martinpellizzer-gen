It belongs to the family Gentianaceae, which is characterized by showy blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges.
