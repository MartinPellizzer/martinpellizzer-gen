It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting various pollinators. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
