It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its woody shrub form with thorny branches. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences called thyrses. Its fruit is a dry, woody capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Gymnosporia thyrsiflora is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
