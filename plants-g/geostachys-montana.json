    "intro": "Geostachys montana, commonly known as the mountain geostachys, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features a compact rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in rocky soils. Geostachys montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
