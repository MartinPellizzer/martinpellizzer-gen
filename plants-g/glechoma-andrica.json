    "intro": "Glechoma andrica, commonly known as ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves with scalloped edges and produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in early summer. Glechoma andrica is often found in moist, shady areas such as woodlands and garden borders. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
