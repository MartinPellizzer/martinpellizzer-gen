    "intro": "Gayophytum caesium, commonly known as the red-stemmed euphorbia, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking red stems and yellow flowers. The plant has smooth, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Gayophytum caesium is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
