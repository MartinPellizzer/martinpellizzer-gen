    "intro": "Geranium molloides, commonly known as the soft geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright stems covered in soft, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive tactile texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming from spring to autumn. Its leaves are rounded and often have a slightly waxy appearance, contributing to its ornamental value. Geranium molloides is well-suited for rock gardens or as a bedding plant due to its compact growth habit and drought tolerance."
