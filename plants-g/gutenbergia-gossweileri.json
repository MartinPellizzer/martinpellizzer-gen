    "intro": "Gutenbergia gossweileri, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a striking member of the Apiaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in winter. The plant is often found growing in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and delicate species requiring specific growing conditions."
