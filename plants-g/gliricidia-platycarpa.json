    "intro": "Gliricidia platycarpa, commonly known as the flat-fruit glory tree, is a fast-growing leguminous tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, round pods containing seeds. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable for soil enrichment and agroforestry. It flowers in clusters of small, white or pale yellow blooms, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is often used in reforestation and as a fodder plant."
