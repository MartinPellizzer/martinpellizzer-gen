    "intro": "Geranium tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features upright, hairy stems that are often covered in fine, white tomentum, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture and a distinctive woolly coating on both surfaces. Geranium tomentosum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
