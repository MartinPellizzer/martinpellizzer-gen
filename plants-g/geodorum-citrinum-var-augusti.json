    "intro": "Geodorum citrinum var. augusti, commonly known as the golden orchid or the yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive pouch-like lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its botanical features include slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in both horticulture and conservation efforts."
