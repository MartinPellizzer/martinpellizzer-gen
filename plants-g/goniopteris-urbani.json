It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The botanical features of Goniopteris urbani make it a valuable species for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
