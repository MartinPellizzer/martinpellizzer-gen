    "intro": "Gymnadenia straminea, commonly known as the yellow lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiraled inflorescence of yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a complex root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Gymnadenia straminea is known for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
