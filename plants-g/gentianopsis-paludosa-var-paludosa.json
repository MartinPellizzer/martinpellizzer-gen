    "intro": "Gentianopsis paludosa var. paludosa, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity and its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
