    "intro": "Glechoma reticulata, commonly known as creeping ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and small, fragrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant spreads rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that can cover large areas. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional herbal medicine for their mild sedative properties."
