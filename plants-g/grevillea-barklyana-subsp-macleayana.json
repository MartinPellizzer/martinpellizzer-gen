    "intro": "Grevillea barklyana subsp. macleayana, commonly known as the Macleay's Grevillea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of New South Wales, Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically grey-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid habitat. The plant produces striking, bright red or orange flowers clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well-suited to coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils. Grevillea barklyana subsp. macleayana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscaping."
