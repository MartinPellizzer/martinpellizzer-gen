    "intro": "Geranium multiflorum, commonly known as the clustered geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming from spring to autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
