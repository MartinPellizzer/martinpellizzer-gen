    "intro": "Galatella sedifolia subsp. illyrica, commonly known as the Illyrian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features a mat-forming habit with small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its range."
