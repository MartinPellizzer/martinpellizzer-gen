It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, feathery blue or purple flowers. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The flowers bloom from late spring to early fall, adding a delicate, airy appearance to gardens."
