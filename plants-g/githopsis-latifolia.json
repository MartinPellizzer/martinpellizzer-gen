    "intro": "Githopsis latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved githopsis, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds when mature. Githopsis latifolia is typically found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental foliage."
