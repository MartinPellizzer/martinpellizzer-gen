    "intro": "Goniopteris hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist, shaded areas. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
