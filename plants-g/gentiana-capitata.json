    "intro": "Gentiana capitata, commonly known as the gentian bluebell, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stem is erect and can reach heights of up to 60 cm. The flowers are clustered in a single head, giving the plant its common name, and it is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
