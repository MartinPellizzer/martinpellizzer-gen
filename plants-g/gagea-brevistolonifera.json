    "intro": "Gagea brevistolonifera, commonly known as the short-stoloniferous gagea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through underground stems, forming dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Gagea brevistolonifera is often found in open woodlands and alpine meadows, where it contributes to the local flora's biodiversity."
