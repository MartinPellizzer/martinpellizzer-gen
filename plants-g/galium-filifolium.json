    "intro": "Galium filifolium, commonly known as silverweed or filifolium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, typically blooming in early summer. Galium filifolium is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
