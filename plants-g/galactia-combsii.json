    "intro": "Galactia combsii, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are arranged in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun."
