    "intro": "Gongora armeniaca var. bicornuta, commonly known as the Armenian nightshade, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dark violet to almost black petals and sepals, which are often adorned with intricate white or pale markings. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
