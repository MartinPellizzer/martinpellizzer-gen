    "intro": "Genista jordanii, commonly known as Jordan's broom, is a shrub native to the Middle East and parts of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its narrow, often spiny leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and resilient to poor soil conditions. Its small, pea-shaped pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
