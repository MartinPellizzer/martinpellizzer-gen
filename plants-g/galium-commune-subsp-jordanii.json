    "intro": "Galium commune subsp. jordanii, commonly known as Jordan's bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically features slender, prostrate stems that bear opposite, small, oval-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its flowers are followed by small, three-lobed berries that mature to a dark blue color."
