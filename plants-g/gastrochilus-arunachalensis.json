It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit. The plant typically produces a single, upright stem with a few leaves and a spike of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
