It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces small, star-shaped petals that surround a central cluster of stamens, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Gorteria asteroides is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
