    "intro": "Geum octopetalum, commonly known as the eight-petaled buttercup, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features upright, branched stems that bear basal leaves with heart-shaped lobes. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with eight petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system consists of tubers that store nutrients, supporting growth during dormant periods. Geum octopetalum is often found in moist woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
