    "intro": "Genoplesium sigmoideum, commonly known as the zigzag lily, is a species of orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, often with a yellow or greenish tinge. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Genoplesium sigmoideum is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological niche within the understorey of native vegetation."
