It features slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a distinctive waxy coating, and are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
