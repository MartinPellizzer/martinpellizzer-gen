It is native to the tropical rainforests of eastern Australia, particularly in Queensland. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy upper surface. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Gossia aneityensis is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
