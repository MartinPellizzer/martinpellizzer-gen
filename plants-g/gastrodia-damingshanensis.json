    "intro": "Gastrodia damingshanensis, commonly known as the Daming Mountain gastrodia, is a rare orchid species native to China. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a fleshy, tuberous structure typical of the Gastrodia genus. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a single flower with a distinctive greenish-yellow coloration. It thrives in humid, shaded forest environments at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
