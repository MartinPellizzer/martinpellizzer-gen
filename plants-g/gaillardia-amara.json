    "intro": "Gaillardia amara, commonly known as the bitterleaf blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant is known for its bright orange and red petals, with a central yellow disk, and thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Gaillardia amara is often found in prairies and open woodlands, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its common name reflects the bitter taste of its leaves, which are not typically consumed by humans."
