    "intro": "Gynura steenisii, commonly known as the African blueberry or elephant's ear, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery blue or white bloom, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Gynura steenisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some African cultures."
