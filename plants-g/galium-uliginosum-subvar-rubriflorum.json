    "intro": "Galium uliginosum subvar. rubriflorum, commonly known as the red-flowered bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, often hairy stems that grow close to the ground, and its leaves are opposite, oval to lance-shaped with smooth or slightly toothed edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pinkish-red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, often acidic soils, making it a common species in marshes and swampy areas. This subspecies is distinguished by its more vibrant floral coloration compared to the typical form of Galium uliginosum."
