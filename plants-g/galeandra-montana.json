It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact, upright growth habit and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and purple. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and narrow, grass-like leaves that help it survive in cold, mountainous climates. Its flowers are typically arranged in a spike and bloom during the warmer months of the year. Galeandra montana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
