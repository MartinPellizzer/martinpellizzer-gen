    "intro": "Geranium ornithopodum, commonly known as the bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, each leaflet resembling a bird's foot, and its bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is a perennial herb that produces small, seed-like fruits called achenes. Geranium ornithopodum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
