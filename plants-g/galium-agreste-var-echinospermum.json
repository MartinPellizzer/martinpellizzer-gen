    "intro": "Galium agreste var. echinospermum, commonly known as the prickly bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique seed structure, with hooked bracts, aids in dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing."
