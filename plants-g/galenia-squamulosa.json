    "intro": "Galenia squamulosa, commonly known as the squamulose galenia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Galenia squamulosa is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
