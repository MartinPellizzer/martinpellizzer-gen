    "intro": "Globba, commonly known as the false ginger, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Zingiberaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their rhizomatous growth habit and showy, clustered inflorescences that resemble those of true gingers. The leaves are typically broad, sword-shaped, and arranged in a rosette pattern. Globba species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
