    "intro": "Gnaphalium genevoisi, commonly known as the Genevoise everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern France and Italy. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant produces fluffy, white to pale yellow flower heads that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, typically growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its scientific name honors the French botanist Jean Genevois, who contributed significantly to the study of alpine flora."
