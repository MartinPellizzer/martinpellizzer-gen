    "intro": "Gossypium harknessii subsp. harknessii, commonly known as the Harkness cotton, is a species of wild cotton native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round bolls that contain fluffy, white fibers used for textile production. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its unique genetic makeup, it is of interest in cotton breeding programs for its potential to improve drought resistance in cultivated cotton varieties."
