    "intro": "Gossypium lapideum, commonly known as the stone cotton, is a species of shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woolly, silver-gray leaves and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces capsules that contain fluffy, white fibers, which are similar to cotton but are not typically used for commercial textile purposes. Gossypium lapideum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing on rocky soils. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various desert animals and insects."
