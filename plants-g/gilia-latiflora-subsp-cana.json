It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a hairy texture. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating wind dispersal."
