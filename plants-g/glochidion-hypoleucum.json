    "intro": "Glochidion hypoleucum, commonly known as the white-leaf glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often pubescent leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by glochidiate fruits, which are covered in tiny, hooked spines. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
