It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, woolly stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers are typically pink or purple, blooming in summer. Gilia floccosa is often found in rocky habitats and is adapted to full sun conditions."
