    "intro": "Gentianella pluvialis, commonly known as the rain gentian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wet meadows and marshy areas in Europe. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
