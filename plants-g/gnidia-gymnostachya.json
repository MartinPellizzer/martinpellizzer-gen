    "intro": "Gnidia gymnostachya, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and dense, thorny branches. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, bead-like fruits that contain a single seed. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Gnidia gymnostachya is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of tannins."
