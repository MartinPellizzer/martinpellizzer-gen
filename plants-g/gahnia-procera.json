    "intro": "Gahnia procera, commonly known as the tall flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps. Gahnia procera plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small animals."
