    "intro": "Gnaphalium tomentosum, commonly known as the wooly cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, soft, white to grayish pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Gnaphalium tomentosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
