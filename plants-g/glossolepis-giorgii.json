    "intro": "Glossolepis giorgii, commonly known as the giant river catfish, is a freshwater fish native to South America. It belongs to the family Siluridae and is characterized by its elongated body and large size. The plant-like appearance of its gill filaments has led to its common name. It is typically found in slow-moving rivers and lakes, where it inhabits the bottom substrate. This species is valued for both its ecological role and its importance in local fisheries."
