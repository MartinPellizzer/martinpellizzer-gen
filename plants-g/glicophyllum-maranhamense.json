    "intro": "Glicophyllum maranhamense, commonly known as the Maranh\u00e3o lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with distinct, elongated lobes. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungal partner and a green alga, which contributes to its photosynthetic capabilities. It typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid tropical environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecological niche."
