    "intro": "Goodenia arenicola, commonly known as the sandgoodenia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and fleshy, helping to reduce water loss. Goodenia arenicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native insects."
