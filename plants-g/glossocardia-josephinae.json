    "intro": "Glossocardia josephinae, commonly known as Josephina's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes that bear delicate, translucent petals and sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, showcasing a complex ecological relationship. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
