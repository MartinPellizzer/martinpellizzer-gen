    "intro": "Glandularia rupestris, commonly known as the rock blanketflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which secrete oils and help protect it from herbivores and excessive moisture loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and rocky environments. Glandularia rupestris is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
