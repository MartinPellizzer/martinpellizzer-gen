    "intro": "Galium ciliatum var. nana, commonly known as dwarf woodsorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves with fine ciliate margins, giving it a distinctive, delicate appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats."
