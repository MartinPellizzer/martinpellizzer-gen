    "intro": "Gliricidia sepium f. maculata, commonly known as the spotted gliricidia, is a variant of the gliricidia tree native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive spotted leaves, which give it a unique appearance compared to the standard form. The plant is a fast-growing legume, often used for forage and soil improvement due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, flat pods containing several seeds. The foliage is rich in protein and is widely utilized in agroforestry systems."
