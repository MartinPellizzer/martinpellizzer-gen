    "intro": "Geranium sessiliflorum subsp. brevicaule, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom from late winter to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in well-drained soils make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
