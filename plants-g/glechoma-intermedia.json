    "intro": "Glechoma intermedia, commonly known as ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a creeping habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in lawns and along woodland edges. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
