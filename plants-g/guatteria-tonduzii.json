    "intro": "Guatteria tonduzii, commonly known as the Tonduzii guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are usually oval-shaped and have a glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
