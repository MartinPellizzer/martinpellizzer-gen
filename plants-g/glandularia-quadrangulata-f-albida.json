    "intro": "Glandularia quadrangulata f. albida, commonly known as the white glandular verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. Its glandular hairs, which give the species its name, are prominent and contribute to its unique appearance. This variety is distinguished by its notably lighter floral color compared to the typical form of Glandularia quadrangulata."
