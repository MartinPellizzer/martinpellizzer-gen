It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of fleshy, four-angled leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. It produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Glyptopetalum quadrangulare is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
