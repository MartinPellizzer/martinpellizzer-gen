It typically forms dense mats of slender, prostrate stems covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture."
