    "intro": "Glandulicactus uncinatus subsp. wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's glochids, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in glochids, which are barbed, hair-like spines that can cause irritation. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and more densely packed glochids compared to other members of the species."
