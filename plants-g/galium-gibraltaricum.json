    "intro": "Galium gibraltaricum, commonly known as Gibraltar bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky and coastal environments, often found in sunny, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
