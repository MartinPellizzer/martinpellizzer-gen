    "intro": "Goeppertia oblonga, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a striking member of the Marantaceae family, native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its bold, arrow-shaped leaves that are often adorned with distinctive dark green and silver variegation patterns. The plant typically grows as an evergreen perennial, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, and thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Goeppertia oblonga is valued not only for its ornamental foliage but also for its air-purifying qualities."
