    "intro": "Galium fruticosum var. citrinum, commonly known as lemony woodcrushers, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a three-lobed, dry capsule that contains several small seeds. This variety is distinguished by its pale yellowish-green coloration, which sets it apart from other members of the Galium genus."
