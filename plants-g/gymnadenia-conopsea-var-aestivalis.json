    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea var. aestivalis, commonly known as the early gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its earlier flowering period compared to other Gymnadenia species."
