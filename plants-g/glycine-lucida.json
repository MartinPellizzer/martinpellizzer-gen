    "intro": "Glycine lucida, commonly known as the moonflower, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night and close by dawn. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five lobes, and its stems are covered in fine, hairy hairs. Glycine lucida thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its unique nocturnal blooming habit makes it a popular choice for evening gardens."
