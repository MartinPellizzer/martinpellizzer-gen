    "intro": "Grindelia scorzonerifolia, commonly known as the brittleblow or desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly foliage and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Grindelia scorzonerifolia plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems."
