    "intro": "Galium punduanum, commonly known as the narrowleaf bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Mediterranean. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, dry fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and streambanks. Galium punduanum is often found in temperate regions and is known for its delicate appearance and ecological importance to insect pollinators."
