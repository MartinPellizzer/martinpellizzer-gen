    "intro": "Grammitis exigua, commonly known as the slender filmy fern, is a small epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that often appear as thin, lace-like structures. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its rhizomes to anchor itself while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Grammitis exigua thrives in humid environments and is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as rainforests."
