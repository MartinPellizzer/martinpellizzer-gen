    "intro": "Gentiana petrophila, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and other mountainous areas. It thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils, often growing in alpine meadows and scree slopes. The plant produces vivid blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand cold and wind. Gentiana petrophila is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
