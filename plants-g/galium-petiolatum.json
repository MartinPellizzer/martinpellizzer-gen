    "intro": "Galium petiolatum, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Galium petiolatum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
