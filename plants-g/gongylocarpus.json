    "intro": "Gongylocarpus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, and often blue or purple-colored bracts that surround the flower heads. The plant is typically found in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or saline soils. Gongylocarpus species are herbaceous perennials that produce small, composite flowers in the center of the bract structure. These plants are often used in coastal restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize dunes and tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
