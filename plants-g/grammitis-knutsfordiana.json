    "intro": "Grammitis knutsfordiana, commonly known as Knutsford's filmy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble parchment. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees or rocks in forested areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Grammitis knutsfordiana is a rare and specialized plant, often found in specific microhabitats with high moisture levels."
