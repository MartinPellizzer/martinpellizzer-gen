    "intro": "Galium suffruticosum var. araucanum, commonly known as the Araucanian bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. The plant features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
