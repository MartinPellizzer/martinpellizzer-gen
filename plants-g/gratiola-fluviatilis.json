    "intro": "Gratiola fluviatilis, commonly known as the river gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland and riparian habitats in North America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecosystem biodiversity. Gratiola fluviatilis thrives in moist soils and is often found along riverbanks and in marshy areas."
