    "intro": "Garrya laurifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf clethra, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are covered in a silvery-white waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage and seasonal interest. Garrya laurifolia is also valued for its ability to attract birds and other wildlife."
