    "intro": "Geum selinifolium, commonly known as the cow parsley buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble those of parsley, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange-red seed pods. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Geum selinifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
