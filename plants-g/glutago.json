    "intro": "Glutago, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains. It is characterized by its unique, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the light, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting specific pollinators. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to withstand the high-altitude climate. Despite its beauty, Glutago is rare and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive."
