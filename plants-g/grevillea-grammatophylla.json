    "intro": "Grevillea grammatophylla, commonly known as the pink waratah, is an evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, large, red or pink flowers that resemble a crown, which are actually clusters of small, petal-like bracts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers within the bracts, which are pollinated by birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged alternately along the stems. Grevillea grammatophylla thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
