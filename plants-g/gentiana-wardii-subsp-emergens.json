    "intro": "Gentiana wardii subsp. emergens, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as meadows and along streams. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, aiding in water retention. This subspecies is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its alpine environment and is often found in association with other high-elevation flora."
