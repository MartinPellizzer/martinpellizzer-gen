    "intro": "Guzmania acutispica, commonly known as the sharp-pointed guzmania, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange, often resembling a torch. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and insects. Its foliage is often adorned with intricate, spiky bracts that enhance its ornamental appeal. Guzmania acutispica thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
