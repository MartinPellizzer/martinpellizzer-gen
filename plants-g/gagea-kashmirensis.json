    "intro": "Gagea kashmirensis, commonly known as the Kashmirian gagea, is a bulbous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Kashmir. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, white to pale pink blooms that typically appear in late spring to early summer. Gagea kashmirensis thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Its botanical features make it a unique and ornamental addition to alpine gardens."
