    "intro": "Geonoma interrupta var. euspatha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf geonoma, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Thyrsopteridaceae and is characterized by its slender, pinnate fronds with a distinctive, narrow leaf blade. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. The variation 'euspatha' refers to the more elongated and narrower leaf structure compared to other varieties within the species."
