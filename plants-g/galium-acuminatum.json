    "intro": "Galium acuminatum, commonly known as bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with opposite, oval-shaped leaves and small white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, three-lobed fruits called utricles, which are characteristic of the Rubiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium acuminatum is often found in temperate regions and is known for its delicate appearance and ecological importance to pollinators."
