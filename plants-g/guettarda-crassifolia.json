    "intro": "Guettarda crassifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved guettarda, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are thick and leathery, with a rough texture that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic value."
