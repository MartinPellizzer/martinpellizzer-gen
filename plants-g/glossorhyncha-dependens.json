    "intro": "Glossorhyncha dependens, commonly known as the hanging lip orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy flowers that hang from the stems, often resembling lips, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and marshy areas. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinct lip that is often brightly colored."
