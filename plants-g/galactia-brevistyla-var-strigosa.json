    "intro": "Galactia brevistyla var. strigosa, commonly known as the hairy galactia, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed sites. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects."
