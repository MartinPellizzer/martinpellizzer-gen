    "intro": "Gladiolus tristis var. grandis, commonly known as the black gladiolus, is a striking ornamental plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which contrast sharply with its green, strap-like leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring tall, erect stems. Its flowers are arranged in dense spikes and bloom in late spring to early summer. The botanical name reflects its close relation to the species *Gladiolus tristis*, with \"grandis\" indicating its larger size compared to other varieties."
