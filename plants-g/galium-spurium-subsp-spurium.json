It features small, opposite leaves that are typically rounded or heart-shaped, with a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and the plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats."
