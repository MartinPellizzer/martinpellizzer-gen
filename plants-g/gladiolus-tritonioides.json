    "intro": "Gladiolus tritonioides, commonly known as the sea gladiolus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of showy, trumpet-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to salt-laden coastal environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique habitat, it is often cultivated in gardens with a preference for full sun."
