    "intro": "Galega fruticosa, commonly known as goat's rue, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright, woody stems with opposite, pinnately compound leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are cylindrical pods that split open to release seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Galega fruticosa is notable for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
