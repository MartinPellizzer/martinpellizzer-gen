    "intro": "Gagea minimoides, commonly known as the dwarf spring beauty, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features basal leaves that are narrow and grass-like, and it produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink. Gagea minimoides is known for its early blooming habit, often appearing in late spring. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its alpine and subalpine environments, with compact growth forms and short flowering periods."
