    "intro": "Geranium litoreum, commonly known as seaside geranium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along shorelines. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds makes it well adapted to coastal habitats."
