    "intro": "Gentianella saxicola, commonly known as the rock gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant features basal leaves that are often woolly or hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are small, blue to violet in color, and bloom in late summer to early autumn. Gentianella saxicola is known for its resilience and is often found in mountainous areas where few plants can survive."
