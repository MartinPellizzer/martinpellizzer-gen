It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soils. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
