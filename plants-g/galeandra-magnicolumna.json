    "intro": "Galeandra magnicolumna, commonly known as the giant column orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, making it one of the tallest orchid species. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a distinctive red or orange throat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
