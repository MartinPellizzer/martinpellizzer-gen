The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to red, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped or ovate, with a serrated margin and a hairy surface. Geranium lentum is often found in grassy areas, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, thriving in partial to full sun."
