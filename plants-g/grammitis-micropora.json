    "intro": "Grammitis micropora, commonly known as the small-pored fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant's leaves are dimorphic, with fertile and sterile fronds differing in structure and appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Grammitis micropora plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
