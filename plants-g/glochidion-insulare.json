    "intro": "Glochidion insulare, commonly known as the island glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Glochidion insulare is often found in lowland to montane rainforests, thriving in humid and shaded environments. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a food source for various insect species and as a component of the forest understory vegetation."
