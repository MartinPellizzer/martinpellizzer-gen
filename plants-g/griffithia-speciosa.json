    "intro": "Griffithia speciosa, commonly known as the noble fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and blue-green needles. The plant produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Griffithia speciosa has a relatively slow growth rate and is adapted to cool, moist climates. Its foliage and cone structure make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
