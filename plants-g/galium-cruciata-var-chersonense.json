    "intro": "Galium cruciata var. chersonense, commonly known as the Chersonese bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It is native to southeastern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
