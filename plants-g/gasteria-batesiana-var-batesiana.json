It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with white veins and a textured surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers on tall stems during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact size and striking foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
