    "intro": "Guaiacum mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican guaiacwood or Spanish cedar, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and dense, aromatic wood. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by small, round fruits containing single seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture with a distinct midrib. Guaiacum mexicanum is valued for its durable wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and medicinal applications."
