    "intro": "Gymnadenia pinguicula, commonly known as the pink fairyslipper, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and heathlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments. Gymnadenia pinguicula is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
