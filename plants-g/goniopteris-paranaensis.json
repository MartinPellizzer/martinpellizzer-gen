It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure known as a sorus, which contains the sporangia for spore production. Its leaves are often described as having a leathery texture and are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Goniopteris paranaensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
