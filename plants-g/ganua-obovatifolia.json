    "intro": "Ganua obovatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf ganua, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features lance-shaped, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Ganua obovatifolia thrives in well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
