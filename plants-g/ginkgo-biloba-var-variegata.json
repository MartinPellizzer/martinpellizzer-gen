    "intro": "Ginkgo biloba var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated ginkgo, is a variant of the ginkgo tree known for its distinctive foliage. Its leaves are typically fan-shaped and exhibit a striking variegation pattern, with a mix of yellow, green, and sometimes white or cream-colored patches. This variation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in the unique coloration. The tree is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the autumn, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and urban landscapes."
