    "intro": "Glyceria aquatica subsp. arundinacea, commonly known as river reed or water reed, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in marshy areas, along riverbanks, and in shallow water, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense stands, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life."
