    "intro": "Gironniera mollissima, commonly known as the softleaf ironwood, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. The fruit is a capsule that contains several small, pale seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
