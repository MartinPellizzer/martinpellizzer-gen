    "intro": "Geranium multiflorum var. ovatifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
