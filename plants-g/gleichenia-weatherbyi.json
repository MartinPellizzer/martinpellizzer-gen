    "intro": "Gleichenia weatherbyi, commonly known as the Weatherby's fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in small, round clusters on the underside of the fronds. Gleichenia weatherbyi is often found in rocky crevices or along the edges of wetlands, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
