    "intro": "Geniostemon gypsophilus, commonly known as the gypsum stonecrop, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing on limestone or gypsum substrates. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
