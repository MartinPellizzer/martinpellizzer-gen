It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped arrangement of fleshy, dark green leaves. The leaves are typically thick and have a textured surface, with a bluish-gray hue due to a waxy coating. It produces small, white or pale green flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
