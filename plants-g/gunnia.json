    "intro": "Gunnia, commonly known as the \"ice plant\" or \"snow flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Montiaceae. These plants are native to the Andes Mountains in South America, where they thrive in high-altitude, arid environments. Gunnia species are characterized by their small, clustered flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves that help them store water. They often have a delicate, frost-resistant appearance, which is well-suited to their cold, mountainous habitat. Due to their unique adaptations, Gunnia plants are sometimes cultivated as ornamental species in cool climates."
