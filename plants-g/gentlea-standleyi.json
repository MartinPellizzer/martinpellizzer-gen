    "intro": "Gentlea standleyi, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its unique floral structure includes a prominent lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Gentlea standleyi is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
