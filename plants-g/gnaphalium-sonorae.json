    "intro": "Gnaphalium sonorae, commonly known as the Sonoran everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Gnaphalium sonorae is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in sandy or rocky soils make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
