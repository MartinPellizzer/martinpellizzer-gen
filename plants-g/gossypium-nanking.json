    "intro": "Gossypium nanking, commonly known as Chinese cotton, is a species of cotton native to East Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces fluffy, white fibers that are harvested for textile use, though it is less economically significant than other cotton species. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a hairy texture, and it thrives in warm, temperate climates. Gossypium nanking is also valued for its ornamental qualities in horticultural settings."
