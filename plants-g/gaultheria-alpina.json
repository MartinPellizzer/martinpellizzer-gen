    "intro": "Gaultheria alpina, commonly known as the Alpine wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the autumn. These berries are edible and contain high levels of aromatic compounds, including methyl salicylate. Gaultheria alpina thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
