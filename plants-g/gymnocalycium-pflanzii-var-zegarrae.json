    "intro": "Gymnocalycium pflanzii var. zegarrae, commonly known as the Zegarra's moon cactus, is a cactus species native to the Andes Mountains of Peru. It is characterized by its globular to cylindrical shape and a spiny, segmented stem. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
