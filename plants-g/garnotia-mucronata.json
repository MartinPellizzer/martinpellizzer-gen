It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss.
