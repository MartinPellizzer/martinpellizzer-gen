    "intro": "Genlisea oxycentron, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a genus of carnivorous plants that belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their specialized bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Genlisea oxycentron is typically found in wetland environments, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. The plant's unique morphology includes small, herbaceous stems and leaves that form dense mats on the water's surface. Its ability to capture prey through these bladders is an adaptation to its nutrient-deficient habitat."
