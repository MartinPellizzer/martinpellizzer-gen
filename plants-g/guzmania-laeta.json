    "intro": "Guzmania laeta, commonly known as the silver star bromeliad, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy, silver-white coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. Guzmania laeta thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity."
