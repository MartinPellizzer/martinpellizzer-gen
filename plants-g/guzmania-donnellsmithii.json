    "intro": "Guzmania donnellsmithii, commonly known as the Donnellsmith's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small invertebrates. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. Guzmania donnellsmithii is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
