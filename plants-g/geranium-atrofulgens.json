    "intro": "Geranium atrofulgens, commonly known as the black-leaf geranium, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It features dark, velvety leaves that contrast beautifully with its clusters of bright red, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is often described as having a metallic sheen, adding to its ornamental appeal. Geranium atrofulgens is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact growth habit and drought tolerance."
