    "intro": "Grangea hispida, commonly known as the rough grangea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Grangea hispida is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
