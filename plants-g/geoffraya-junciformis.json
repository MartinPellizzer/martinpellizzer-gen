    "intro": "Geoffraya junciformis, commonly known as the swamp bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant is part of the Lentibulariaceae family, known for its carnivorous tendencies, though Geoffraya junciformis is not considered a true carnivore. It thrives in nutrient-poor waters and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms. Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in environments where other plants struggle to grow."
