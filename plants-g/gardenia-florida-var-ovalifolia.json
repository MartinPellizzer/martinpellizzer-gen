    "intro": "Gardenia florida var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf gardenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green elliptical leaves that are broader and more oval in shape compared to the typical gardenia species. The plant produces large, waxy, white flowers with a strong, fragrant scent, which bloom in summer. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
