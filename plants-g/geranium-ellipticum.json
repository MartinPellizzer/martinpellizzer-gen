    "intro": "Geranium ellipticum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, elliptic-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
