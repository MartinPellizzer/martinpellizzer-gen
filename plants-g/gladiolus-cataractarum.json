    "intro": "Gladiolus cataractarum, commonly known as the waterfall gladiolus, is a rare and striking member of the Iridaceae family native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, showy flowers that come in a range of vibrant colors. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or streamside habitats. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many parts of its native range."
