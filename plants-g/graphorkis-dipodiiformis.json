    "intro": "Graphorkis dipodiiformis, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and small, intricately shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in cloud forests or alpine meadows. Its floral structure includes specialized petals and sepals that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
