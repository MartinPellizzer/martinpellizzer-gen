    "intro": "Grammitis fluminensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in humid forests. The plant has a rosette-like structure with closely spaced, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of spongy tissue. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Grammitis fluminensis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions."
