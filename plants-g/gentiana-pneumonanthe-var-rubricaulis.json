    "intro": "Gentiana pneumonanthe var. rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed gentian, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its deep blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer, and its distinctive reddish stems that contrast sharply with the foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly rough texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
