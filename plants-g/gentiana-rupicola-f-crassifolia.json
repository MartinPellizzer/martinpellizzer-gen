    "intro": "Gentiana rupicola f. crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved gentian, is a botanical variant of the gentian species native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its robust, thick, and fleshy leaves, which help it retain moisture in its harsh, rocky habitat. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native range."
