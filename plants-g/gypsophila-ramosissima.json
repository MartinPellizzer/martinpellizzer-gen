    "intro": "Gypsophila ramosissima, commonly known as the desert candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers resembling candy sprinkles. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Gypsophila ramosissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to flourish in dry, rocky conditions."
