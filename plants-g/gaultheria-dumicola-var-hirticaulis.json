    "intro": "Gaultheria dumicola var. hirticaulis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in late winter or early spring, which are followed by bright red, edible berries. These berries are rich in aromatic oils and have a sharp, spicy flavor, making them popular in local cuisines and traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories or rocky areas."
