    "intro": "Guthnickia atrosanguinea, commonly known as the black blood orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its dark red or purplish flowers, which are often described as having a blood-like hue, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or among leaf litter. Its flowers are small and clustered, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Guthnickia atrosanguinea is considered a conservation concern."
