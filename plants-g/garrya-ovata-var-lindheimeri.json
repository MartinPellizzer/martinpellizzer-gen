It is characterized by its silvery-white, glandular hairs that cover the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and turn reddish in the autumn. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant."
