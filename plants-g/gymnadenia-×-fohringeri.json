It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
