    "intro": "Garcinia arenicola, commonly known as the sand garcinia, is a species of flowering plant native to coastal areas of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain a single seed. Garcinia arenicola thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes or along the edges of mangrove forests. Its unique adaptations make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
