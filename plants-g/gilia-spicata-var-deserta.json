    "intro": "Gilia spicata var. deserta, commonly known as desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
