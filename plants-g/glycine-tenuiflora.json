    "intro": "Glycine tenuiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved soybean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, often using tendrils to support its growth. Its seeds are encased in pods and are used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein. Glycine tenuiflora plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in agricultural settings."
