    "intro": "Genista biflora var. plumosa, commonly known as the silky broom. This variety is a shrub native to the western Mediterranean region, characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its soft, airy foliage and long flowering period."
