    "intro": "Gmelina finlaysoniana f. viridibracteata, commonly known as the green bract gmelina, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the gmelina genus. It is characterized by its distinctive green bracts that are typically more prominent than those of the standard species. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It possesses lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
