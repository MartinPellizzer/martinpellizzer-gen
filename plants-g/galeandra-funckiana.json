    "intro": "Galeandra funckiana, commonly known as the Funck's orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers that can be pink, purple, or white in color. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in the dry environments it inhabits. The orchid's botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the ecological systems of its native regions."
