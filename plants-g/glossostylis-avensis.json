    "intro": "Glossostylis avensis, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a flowering plant species native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its salt-excreting leaves and pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that aid in respiration in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Glossostylis avensis plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms. Its ability to tolerate saline conditions makes it an important component of mangrove forests."
