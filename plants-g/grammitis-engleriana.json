    "intro": "Grammitis engleriana, commonly known as the Engler's spikemoss, is a member of the family Huperjaniaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping rhizome with upright, narrow leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its sporangia are clustered in strobila, which are borne on the upper part of the leaves. Grammitis engleriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
