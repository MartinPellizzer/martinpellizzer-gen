    "intro": "Gymnosporia filamentosa var. major, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Gymnosporia filamentosa var. major plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed soils and rocky habitats."
