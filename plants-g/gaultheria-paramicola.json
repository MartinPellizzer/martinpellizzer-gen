It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves contain aromatic compounds, including methyl salicylate, which gives it a distinctive minty scent. Gaultheria paramicola is often found in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils."
