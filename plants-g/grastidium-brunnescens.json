    "intro": "Grastidium brunnescens, commonly known as the brown-stemmed grastidium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody, cylindrical stems that are covered in a thick, brownish bark. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
