    "intro": "Gliricidia michelii, commonly known as the white gliricidia, is a fast-growing leguminous tree native to tropical regions. It has bipinnate leaves that are alternate and compound, with small, elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, woody pods that split open when mature. Gliricidia michelii is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and is often used in agroforestry systems."
