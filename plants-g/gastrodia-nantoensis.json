    "intro": "Gastrodia nantoensis, commonly known as the Nanto ginseng, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it relies on fungal associations for its nutrition rather than photosynthesis. The plant produces a fleshy, tuberous root that is highly valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
