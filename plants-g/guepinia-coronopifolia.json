    "intro": "Guepinia coronopifolia, commonly known as the crown-of-thorns or sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its woody stems and fleshy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in clusters. It is highly salt-tolerant and thrives in coastal environments, often found in sandy soils near the shoreline. Guepinia coronopifolia is also known for its ability to withstand strong winds and salt spray, making it a resilient species in marine ecosystems."
