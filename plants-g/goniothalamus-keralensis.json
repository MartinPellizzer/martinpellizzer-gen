    "intro": "Goniothalamus keralensis, commonly known as the Keralan genus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are follicles that mature into woody capsules, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
