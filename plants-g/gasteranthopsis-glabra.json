It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and small, often white or pale-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually smooth and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and specific ecological requirements, it is a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
