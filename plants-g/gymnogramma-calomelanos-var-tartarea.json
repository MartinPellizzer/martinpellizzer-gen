    "intro": "Gymnogramma calomelanos var. tartarea, commonly known as the Tartarean Kidney Fern, is a variant of the Kidney Fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its bioluminescent spore cases, which emit a faint blue glow in the dark, a unique trait among ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fronds are compound, with a distinctive kidney-shaped appearance, and they are covered in fine, silky hairs. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unusual visual characteristics."
