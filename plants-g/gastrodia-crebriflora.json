    "intro": "Gastrodia crebriflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered twayblade, is an orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant with a short, thick rhizome and lacks true leaves, relying instead on its underground structure for photosynthesis. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow or greenish flowers, which are typically arranged in a dense spike. Gastrodia crebriflora is known for its medicinal properties and is often harvested for use in traditional herbal remedies. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
