    "intro": "Galium microcarpum, commonly known as little-fruit bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Galium microcarpum is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
