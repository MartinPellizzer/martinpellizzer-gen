    "intro": "Gastrodia maliauensis, commonly known as the Maliau Giant Tuber, is a rare orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, fleshy underground tubers and its lack of above-ground foliage, relying entirely on its tubers for photosynthesis. The plant produces a single, showy, yellowish-green flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of primary forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
