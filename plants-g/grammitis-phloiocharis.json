    "intro": "Grammitis phloiocharis, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis phloiocharis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
