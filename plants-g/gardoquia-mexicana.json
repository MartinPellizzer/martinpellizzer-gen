    "intro": "Gardoquia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gardoquia mexicana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its low water requirements."
