    "intro": "Grevillea scabra, commonly known as the rough grevillea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright orange or red flowers in dense, cylindrical spikes, which are particularly showy during the spring and summer seasons. Grevillea scabra is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. It is an important plant in native gardens due to its ornamental value and ability to attract nectar-feeding birds and insects."
