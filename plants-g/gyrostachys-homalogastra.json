It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and a basal rosette of leaves. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse easily. Gyrostachys homalogastra is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
