    "intro": "Gagea liotardii var. taurica, commonly known as the Crimean spring beauty, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Caucasus and parts of southern Russia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, often growing in forested or rocky habitats. Its bulbs are relatively small and serve as storage organs for nutrients. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
