    "intro": "Galeana pratensis, commonly known as the prairie galea, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and prairies, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Galeana pratensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and role in supporting local pollinators."
