    "intro": "Glechoma mussinii, commonly known as creeping ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that can cover the ground effectively. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and adaptable species within its native range."
