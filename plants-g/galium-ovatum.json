    "intro": "Galium ovatum, commonly known as sweet woodruff, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its aromatic foliage has been historically used in herbal teas and as a flavoring agent. Galium ovatum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover."
