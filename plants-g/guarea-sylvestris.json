    "intro": "Guarea sylvestris, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and broad, glossy leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing the edible Brazil nuts. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. The plant plays a vital ecological role in the rainforest, supporting a wide array of wildlife and contributing to the forest's biodiversity."
