    "intro": "Galinsoga hirsuta, commonly known as hairy gallinsoga, is an annual weed native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a problematic weed in many regions."
