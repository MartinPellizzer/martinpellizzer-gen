    "intro": "Grammitis rivularis, commonly known as the river fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions. It typically grows on rocks or trees in moist, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are often clustered closely together. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis rivularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
