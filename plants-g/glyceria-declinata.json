    "intro": "Glyceria declinata, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland ecosystems. Glyceria declinata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
