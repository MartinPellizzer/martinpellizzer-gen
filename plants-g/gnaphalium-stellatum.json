It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are surrounded by bracts that give it a fluffy appearance. It is typically found in moist meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in temperate climates. Gnaphalium stellatum is known for its hardy nature and is often used in dried floral arrangements due to its long-lasting flowers."
