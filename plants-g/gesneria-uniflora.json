    "intro": "Gesneria uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower gesneria, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It features glossy, dark green elliptical leaves that are often adorned with prominent veins. The plant produces strikingly large, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria uniflora is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
