It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. It produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective pioneer species in ecological restoration projects."
