    "intro": "Gomphia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf gomphia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy, round leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
