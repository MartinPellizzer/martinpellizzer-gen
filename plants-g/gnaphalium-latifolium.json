    "intro": "Gnaphalium latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers.

The plant is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting, dried appearance."
