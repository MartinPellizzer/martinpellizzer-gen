    "intro": "Gentianella crispata subsp. autumnalis, commonly known as autumn gentian, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators during the late growing season."
