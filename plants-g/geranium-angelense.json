The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
