    "intro": "Gastrodia nipponicoides, commonly known as the Japanese gastrodia, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Japan. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for nutrition. The plant produces a unique, fleshy, and often reddish-brown underground tuber that is the primary part used in traditional medicine. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in association with specific fungal species. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and protected in its native range."
