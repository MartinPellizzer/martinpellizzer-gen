    "intro": "Gonystylus sympetala, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Dipterocarpaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 40 meters tall, characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood and aromatic bark. The plant has opposite, simple, and lanceolate leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. Its flowers are small and typically grouped in inflorescences, and it produces woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to its high commercial value, Gonystylus sympetala is threatened by overexploitation and habitat loss."
