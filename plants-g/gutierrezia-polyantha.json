    "intro": "Gutierrezia polyantha, commonly known as the yellow starthistle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small stars. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gutierrezia polyantha is known for its spiny stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
