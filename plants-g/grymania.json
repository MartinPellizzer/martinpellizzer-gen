    "intro": "Grymania, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a unique plant native to the savannas of Africa. It is a small, deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of about 5 meters. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, clustered leaves. Its flowers are inconspicuous, but the tree produces fragrant, woody fruits that contain seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited range, Grymania is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
