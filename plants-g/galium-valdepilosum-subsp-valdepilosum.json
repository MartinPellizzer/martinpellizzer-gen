    "intro": "Galium valdepilosum subsp. valdepilosum, commonly known as the valley hairy bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has slender, ascending stems covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its overall ecological niche in forest understories."
