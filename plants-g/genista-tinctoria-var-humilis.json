    "intro": "Genista tinctoria var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf yellow broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features slender, wiry stems covered in small, needle-like leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or sandy gardens. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover."
