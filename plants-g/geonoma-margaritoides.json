    "intro": "Geonoma margaritoides, commonly known as the glassy fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often appear translucent or glassy in texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which help it absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. The fronds are usually arranged in a compact rosette, making it a distinctive and visually appealing plant in its natural habitat."
