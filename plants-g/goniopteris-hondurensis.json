    "intro": "Goniopteris hondurensis, commonly known as the Honduras moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often recurved fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Goniopteris hondurensis is notable for its ancient lineage, with fossil records dating back to the Carboniferous period."
