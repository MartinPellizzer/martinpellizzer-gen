    "intro": "Galega parviflora, commonly known as small-flowered goat's rue, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, branching stems covered in small, opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Galega parviflora is often found in open woods, meadows, and along roadsides, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
