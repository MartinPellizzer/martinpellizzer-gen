    "intro": "Guatteria sagotiana var. gracilior, commonly known as the slender guatteria, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the humid lowlands of Central America. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
