    "intro": "Gastrodia selabintanensis, commonly known as the Selabintan orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the tropical rainforests of Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and somewhat tuberous structure. The plant is known for its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its underground stem for photosynthesis. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the shade of the forest canopy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
