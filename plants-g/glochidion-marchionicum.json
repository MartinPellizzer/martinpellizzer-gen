It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, alternate leaves that are usually glabrous or nearly hairless. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cupular inflorescences. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is often found in lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
