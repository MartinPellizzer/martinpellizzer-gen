    "intro": "Gouana, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Eugenia uniflora*, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces bright red, edible berries that are rich in antioxidants and often used in jams and desserts. Its botanical features include a woody stem, simple leaves, and a unique, clustered inflorescence. Gouana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in warm climates for both its beauty and fruit."
