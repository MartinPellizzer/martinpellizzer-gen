    "intro": "Geranium heliotropioides, commonly known as the Cape geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
