    "intro": "Gastrochilus japonicus, commonly known as the Japanese toothed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to East Asia. It is characterized by its linear, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Gastrochilus japonicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
