    "intro": "Guatteria grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered guatteria, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often lanceolate leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red drupe that contains a single seed, making it an important food source for birds and mammals. Guatteria grandifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and floral display."
