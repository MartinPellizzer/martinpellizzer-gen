It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow to orange. Its bulbs are fleshy and store nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The varietal name \"glaucescens\" refers to the bluish-green hue of its foliage, distinguishing it from other varieties of Gagea lutea."
