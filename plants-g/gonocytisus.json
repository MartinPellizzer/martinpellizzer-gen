    "intro": "Gonocytisus, commonly known as the sweet shrub, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to southern Africa. The plants are characterized by their small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white or pink. They have simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. Gonocytisus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often used in gardens for their drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
