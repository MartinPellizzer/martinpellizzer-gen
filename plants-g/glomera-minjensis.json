    "intro": "Glomera minjensis, commonly known as the Minjeng glomerate, is a flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, with palmate leaves and clusters of bright yellow or orange blooms. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded understory environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
