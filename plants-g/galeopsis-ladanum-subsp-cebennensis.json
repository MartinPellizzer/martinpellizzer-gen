    "intro": "Galeopsis ladanum subsp. cebennensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hedge-nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
