    "intro": "Gaultheria epiphyta, commonly known as the epiphytic wintergreen, is a member of the Ericaceae family and is native to the temperate rainforests of South America. It is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, instead relying on atmospheric moisture and organic debris. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are rich in aromatic oils, which give it its characteristic wintergreen scent. Its leaves are typically evergreen, glossy, and have a leathery texture, adapted to the humid and shaded environments it inhabits. Gaultheria epiphyta is often found in the canopy layers of forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with dappled sunlight."
