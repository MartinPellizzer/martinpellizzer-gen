    "intro": "Guapeba lucens, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange floral displays. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
