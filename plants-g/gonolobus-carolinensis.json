    "intro": "Gonolobus carolinensis, commonly known as Carolina morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its twining stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowers are usually pale blue to purple and bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. The plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
