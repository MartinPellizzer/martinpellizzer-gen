    "intro": "Gymnopteris naumannii, commonly known as the Naumann's huperbole, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Gymnopteris naumannii is notable for its unique morphology and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
