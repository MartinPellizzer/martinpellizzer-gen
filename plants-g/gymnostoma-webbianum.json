    "intro": "Gymnostoma webbianum, commonly known as the webbed liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a flat, green thallus that often features a web-like structure on its surface. Gymnostoma webbianum lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, undifferentiated body called a thallus. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the upper surface of the thallus."
