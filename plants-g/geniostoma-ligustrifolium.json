It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy or well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
