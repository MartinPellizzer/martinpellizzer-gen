    "intro": "Gagea alii, commonly known as the white bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, moist environments. Its bulbs are underground and serve as storage organs, allowing the plant to survive harsh winter conditions. Gagea alii is often found in open woodlands and alpine meadows, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
