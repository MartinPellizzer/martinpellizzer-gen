    "intro": "Gagea spelaea, commonly known as the cave gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in limestone habitats. It is adapted to cool, shaded environments and is typically associated with subalpine and alpine zones. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Gagea spelaea is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
