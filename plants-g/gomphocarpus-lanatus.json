    "intro": "Gomphocarpus lanatus, commonly known as the velvetleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, broad leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that attract various pollinators. The plant belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is known for its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Gomphocarpus lanatus is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in full sun."
