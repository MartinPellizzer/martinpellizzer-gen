    "intro": "Geum urbanum subvar. australe, commonly known as the northern wood avens, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks, preferring rich, loamy soils. The plant features a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers in early to mid-summer. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
