    "intro": "Gymnogramma imbricata, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of trichomes. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with the lower surface often bearing a distinctive shield-like structure. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates such as soil or rock."
