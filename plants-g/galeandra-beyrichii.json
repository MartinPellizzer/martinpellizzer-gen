    "intro": "Galeandra beyrichii, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive greenish throat and prominent lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Galeandra beyrichii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
