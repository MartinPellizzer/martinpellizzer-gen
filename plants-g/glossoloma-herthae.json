    "intro": "Glossoloma herthae, commonly known as the Hertha's ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring a single, slender stem and a single, showy white or pale green flower. The plant has a unique root system that allows it to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, which is crucial for its survival in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering orchids in the region. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are essential to protect this rare botanical species."
