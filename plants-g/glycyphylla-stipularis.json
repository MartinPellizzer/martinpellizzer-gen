    "intro": "Glycyphylla stipularis, commonly known as the stipular glycyphila, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Glycyphylla stipularis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access groundwater. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
