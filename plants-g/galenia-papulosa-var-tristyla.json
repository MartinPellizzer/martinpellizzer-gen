    "intro": "Galenia papulosa var. tristyla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved galenia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in grassland and rocky habitats, characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variant is distinguished from other galenia species by its narrower leaves and specific geographic distribution."
