    "intro": "Georchis calva, commonly known as the pale ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial herb with a unique morphology, featuring a single, slender stem and a cluster of narrow, pale green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, hood-like structure that resembles a ghostly face. It is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often in pine or hardwood forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and requires careful conservation efforts."
