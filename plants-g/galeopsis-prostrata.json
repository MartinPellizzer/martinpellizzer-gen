    "intro": "Galeopsis prostrata, commonly known as creeping hedge-nettle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, two-lobed capsule that splits open when mature. Galeopsis prostrata is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its role in supporting local insect populations."
