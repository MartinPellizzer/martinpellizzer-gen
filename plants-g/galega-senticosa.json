    "intro": "Galega senticosa, commonly known as the sticky vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often sticky stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Galega senticosa is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing abilities, making it useful in soil enrichment."
