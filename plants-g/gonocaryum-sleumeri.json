    "intro": "Gonocaryum sleumeri, commonly known as the Sleumer's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique floral structure includes a spurred lip and a column, typical of many orchid genera. Due to its restricted habitat and specific ecological requirements, Gonocaryum sleumeri is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
