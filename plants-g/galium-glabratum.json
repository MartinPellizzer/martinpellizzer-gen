    "intro": "Galium glabratum, commonly known as smooth bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by birds. Galium glabratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
