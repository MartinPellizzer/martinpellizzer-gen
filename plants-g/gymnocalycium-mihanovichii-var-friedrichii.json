    "intro": "Gymnocalycium mihanovichii var. friedrichii, commonly known as the Friedreich's moon cactus, is a succulent native to South America. It features a swollen, bulbous stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces spiny, fleshy stems with small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow or orange. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant. The variety is prized for its compact size and vibrant floral display."
