    "intro": "Geranium lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf geranium, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, or white during the summer months. Geranium lanceolatum is often found in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its foliage and flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
