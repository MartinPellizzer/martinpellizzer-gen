    "intro": "Galium palustre var. umbrosum, commonly known as black willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color and bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with smooth or slightly toothed margins. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it a common sight in swampy areas. This variant is distinguished by its darker, more robust stems compared to the typical form of Galium palustre."
