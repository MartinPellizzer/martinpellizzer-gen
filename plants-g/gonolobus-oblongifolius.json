    "intro": "Gonolobus oblongifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, broad leaves and trumpet-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant is typically an annual or perennial herb with a climbing habit, often found in moist, open habitats. Its flowers emit a sweet scent to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds."
