    "intro": "Goodyera clavata, commonly known as the lady's slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its distinctive, showy orchid flowers that resemble a slipper. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on the forest floor or on rocky substrates. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a pouch-like structure at the base. Goodyera clavata is a perennial herb that produces a single flower per stem, and it is known for its delicate and ephemeral bloom period."
