    "intro": "Galium chonoense var. valdivianum, commonly known as the Valdivian bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the temperate rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
