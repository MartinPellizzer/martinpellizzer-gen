    "intro": "Geranium subcaulescens var. subacutum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive acute tip. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
