    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea f. trifida, commonly known as the trifid lady's tresses, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking, dark purple to black inflorescence. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a spike of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, often in areas with rich, humusy soil. This orchid is notable for its unique floral structure and is considered a conservation priority due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity."
