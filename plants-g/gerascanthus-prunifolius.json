    "intro": "Gerascanthus prunifolius, commonly known as the cherry-leaf gerascanthus, is a member of the Geraniaceae family. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that resemble those of cherry trees. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness. Gerascanthus prunifolius is native to certain regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
