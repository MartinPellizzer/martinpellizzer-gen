    "intro": "Genista foliolosa, commonly known as the leafless broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its sparse, often leafless appearance, with small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has slender, branching stems that are typically covered in fine, hairy pubescence. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Genista foliolosa is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
