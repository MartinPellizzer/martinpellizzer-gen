It is characterized by its large, frilled, and often hairy fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Goniopteris aspera plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various organisms."
