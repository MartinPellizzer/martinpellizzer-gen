    "intro": "Grammitis reitzii, commonly known as the Reitz's spikemoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls. It reproduces via spores, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of the leaves. Grammitis reitzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
