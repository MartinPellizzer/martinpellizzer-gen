    "intro": "Grammitis pleurogrammoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperbush, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually pale green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Grammitis pleurogrammoides is often epiphytic, growing on tree trunks or branches in humid forest habitats."
