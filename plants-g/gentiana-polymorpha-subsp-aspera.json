    "intro": "Gentiana polymorpha subsp. aspera, commonly known as the rough gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a rough, hairy texture, giving it its subspecies name. The rough gentian is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often found in wildflower gardens and naturalized areas."
