    "intro": "Guettarda macrosperma, commonly known as the golden guettarda, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, fragrant foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Guettarda macrosperma is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal and humid environments."
