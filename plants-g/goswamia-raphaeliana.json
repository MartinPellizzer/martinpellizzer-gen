    "intro": "Goswamia raphaeliana, commonly known as the Raphael's goswamia, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the western Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often found in rocky crevices or forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
