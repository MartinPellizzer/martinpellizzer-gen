    "intro": "Glycine hispida var. affine-virescens, commonly known as the green hairy bean, is a variant of the hairy vetch, characterized by its dense, pubescent foliage and trifoliate leaves. It is a leguminous plant that thrives in temperate climates and is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The plant produces small, pale green to yellow flowers that develop into elongated, hairy pods containing small, round seeds. It is well adapted to various soil types and is valued for its ecological benefits in sustainable agriculture. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ornamental and agricultural purposes."
