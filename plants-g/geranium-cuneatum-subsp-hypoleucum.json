    "intro": "Geranium cuneatum subsp. hypoleucum, commonly known as the white-flowered geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and extended flowering period."
