    "intro": "Gentiana hexaphylla var. septemloba, commonly known as the seven-lobed gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stem. This variant is distinguished by its seven-lobed petals, which set it apart from the typical six-lobed form of the species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations."
