    "intro": "Gesneria pumila subsp. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and container cultivation."
