    "intro": "Gypsophila myriantha, commonly known as the clustered baby's breath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, seed-like fruits that aid in its propagation. Gypsophila myriantha is often used in floral arrangements due to its airy, lace-like appearance."
