    "intro": "Gyrostachys rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of narrow, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock garden environments."
