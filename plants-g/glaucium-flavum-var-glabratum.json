    "intro": "Glaucium flavum var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth yellow glory flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, branched stems that are often covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and unique texture."
