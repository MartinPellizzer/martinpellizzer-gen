    "intro": "Gerascanthus oblongifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, often with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and rockeries. Gerascanthus oblongifolius is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
