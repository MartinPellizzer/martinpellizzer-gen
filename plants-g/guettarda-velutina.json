    "intro": "Guettarda velutina, commonly known as velvet guettarda, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to thrive in partial shade and its tolerance to coastal conditions. Guettarda velutina is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
