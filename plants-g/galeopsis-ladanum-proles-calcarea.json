    "intro": "Galeopsis ladanum proles calcarea, commonly known as limestone milkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in calcareous soils, hence its common name, and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the mint family, Lamiaceae."
