    "intro": "Gypsophila polygonoides subsp. thymifolia, commonly known as sweet everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
