The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive hairy texture on its stems and leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Galeandra barbata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
