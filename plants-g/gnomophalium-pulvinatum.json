    "intro": "Gnomophalium pulvinatum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows from 1 to 3 feet tall, featuring a thick, branching stem and small, fuzzy leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, making it important to handle the plant with care. Gnomophalium pulvinatum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water and nutrient availability."
