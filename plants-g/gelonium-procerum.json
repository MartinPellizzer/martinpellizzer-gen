    "intro": "Gelonium procerum, commonly known as the slender gelonium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a low-maintenance plant ideal for arid or semi-arid landscapes."
