    "intro": "Gastrodia lacista, commonly known as the Chinese thunder god, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous roots and its distinctive, elongated, leafless stems that bear small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and is often cultivated for its purported health benefits. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions to grow successfully. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
