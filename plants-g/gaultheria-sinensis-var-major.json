    "intro": "Gaultheria sinensis var. major, commonly known as the Chinese wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring. The plant is notable for its aromatic leaves, which contain methyl salicylate, a compound responsible for its wintergreen scent. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
