    "intro": "Gasteria nitida var. parvipunctata, commonly known as the dwarf dot gasteria, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves with small white dots along the edges. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
