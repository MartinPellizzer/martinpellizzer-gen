    "intro": "Gilibertia acuminatissima, commonly known as the red sandbelly, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces distinctive, elongated seed pods that mature into hard, woody capsules. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Gilibertia acuminatissima is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to survive in low-nutrient, drought-prone areas."
