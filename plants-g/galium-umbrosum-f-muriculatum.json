    "intro": "Galium umbrosum f. muriculatum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, often hairy stems that are distinctly rough to the touch, a characteristic reflected in its subspecies name *muriculatum*. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its overall rugged appearance. This subspecies thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
