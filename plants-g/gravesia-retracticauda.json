    "intro": "Gravesia retracticauda, commonly known as the curled-tail gravesia, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, spiraling inflorescence that resembles a curling tail, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in clusters along the elongated, twisted stems. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Gravesia retracticauda is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is typically grown in shaded, humid environments."
