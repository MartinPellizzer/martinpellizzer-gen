    "intro": "Gymnogramma refracta, commonly known as the brittle maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often described as fragile and somewhat translucent. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Gymnogramma refracta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its unique foliage."
