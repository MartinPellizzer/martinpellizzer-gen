    "intro": "Goodyera yaeyamae, commonly known as the Yaeyama lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a short rhizome and a cluster of dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant produces a dense inflorescence of small, white to pale green flowers arranged in a loose spiral pattern. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect light. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
