    "intro": "Grammitis kalawayae, commonly known as the Kalaway fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in montane forests. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it plays a minor but important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
