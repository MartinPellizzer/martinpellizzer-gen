    "intro": "Gliricidia latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf gliricidia, is a fast-growing leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions. It features compound leaves with multiple leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It is often used in agroforestry and as a forage crop due to its high nutritional value. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
