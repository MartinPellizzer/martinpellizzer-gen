    "intro": "Gesneria verrucosa, commonly known as the warty gesneria, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that often have a textured, bumpy surface. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of orange and yellow, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria verrucosa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
