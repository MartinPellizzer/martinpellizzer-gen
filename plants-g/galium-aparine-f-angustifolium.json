    "intro": "Galium aparine f. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as along paths, in fields, and near woodland edges. This variant is distinguished by its narrower foliage compared to the typical form of Galium aparine."
