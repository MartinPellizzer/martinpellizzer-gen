    "intro": "Galium californicum subsp. sierrae, commonly known as Sierra bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and typically covered with fine hairs. Sierra bedstraw is adapted to rocky and open habitats, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments."
