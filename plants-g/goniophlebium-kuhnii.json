    "intro": "Goniophlebium kuhnii, commonly known as the Kuhn's rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, lanceolate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Goniophlebium kuhnii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
