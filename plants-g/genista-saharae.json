    "intro": "Genista saharae, commonly known as the Saharan broom, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, narrow leaflets, and it is well adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. Genista saharae is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
