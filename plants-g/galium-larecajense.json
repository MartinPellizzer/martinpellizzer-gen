    "intro": "Galium larecajense, commonly known as the Larecaja bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its slender stems are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that ripen to a dark red color. Galium larecajense is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and potential medicinal properties."
