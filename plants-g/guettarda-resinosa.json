    "intro": "Guettarda resinosa, commonly known as the resinous guettarda, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Guettarda resinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy nature and adaptability to different soil types."
