    "intro": "Glochidion fortunei var. longistylum, commonly known as the long-styled glochidion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its small, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature common in the Euphorbiaceae family. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the natural environment."
