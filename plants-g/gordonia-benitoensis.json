It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, specifically in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in the spring. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its mountainous habitat.
