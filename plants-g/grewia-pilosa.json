    "intro": "Grewia pilosa, commonly known as the velvet bushwillow, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, reddish-brown stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruits are small, dry drupes that split open to release seeds. Grewia pilosa is often found in dry savanna and woodland habitats, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
