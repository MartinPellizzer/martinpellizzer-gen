    "intro": "Galeandra devoniana var. delphina, commonly known as the Devonian Delphina, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, often arranged in clusters along the stem. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
