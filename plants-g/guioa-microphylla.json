    "intro": "Guioa microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved guioa, is a deciduous tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that turn yellow before falling in the dry season. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round fruits that split open to release seeds. It is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and use in reforestation projects. The plant is also known for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and drought."
