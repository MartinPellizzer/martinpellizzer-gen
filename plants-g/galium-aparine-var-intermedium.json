    "intro": "Galium aparine var. intermedium, commonly known as common bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its stems are covered with stiff, hooked hairs that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. The leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
