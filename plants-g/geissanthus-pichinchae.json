    "intro": "Geissanthus pichinchae, commonly known as the Pichincha bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in cloud forests. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine, soft pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
