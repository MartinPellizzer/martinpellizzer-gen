    "intro": "Guzmania pseudodissitiflora, commonly known as the starry guzmania, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that resembles a star, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that collect rainwater, forming a central pool used for attracting pollinators. Its foliage is typically a deep green, with some varieties displaying variegation. Guzmania pseudodissitiflora thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
