    "intro": "Gireoudia conchifolia var. warscewicziana, commonly known as the Warscewicz's gireoudia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the mountainous areas of Vietnam and Cambodia. The plant is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
