    "intro": "Glechoma juncea, commonly known as ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs and have a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It is known for its creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. Glechoma juncea is often considered a weed in lawns but is valued in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
