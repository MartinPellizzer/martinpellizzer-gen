    "intro": "Gymnobalanus fendleri, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to hot and dry climates. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
