    "intro": "Guzmania geniculata, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky red bracts that surround its small, clustered flowers. The plant features a rosette of long, narrow, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. Guzmania geniculata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
