It is characterized by its spherical or slightly elongated stem, covered in white, soft spines. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Gymnocalycium marquezii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh conditions."
