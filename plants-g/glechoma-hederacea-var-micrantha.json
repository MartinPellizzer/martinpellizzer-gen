    "intro": "Glechoma hederacea var. micrantha, commonly known as creeping ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with scalloped edges and produces small, blue or violet flowers in early summer. The plant spreads rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that can cover the ground. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along garden paths. Its aromatic leaves and medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest in traditional herbal practices."
