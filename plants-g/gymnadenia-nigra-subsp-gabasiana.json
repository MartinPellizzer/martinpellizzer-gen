    "intro": "Gymnadenia nigra subsp. gabasiana, commonly known as the Gabasian lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and meadows, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The plant produces a dense, dark green foliage and a striking, fragrant inflorescence of white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spiral pattern. It is characterized by its tuberous roots and is part of the Orchidaceae family. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
