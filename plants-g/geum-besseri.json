    "intro": "Geum besseri, commonly known as the Bessera mountain avens, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Geum besseri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
