    "intro": "Gonogona, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a genus of flowering plants native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asphodelaceae and consists of several species, including Gonogona filicifolia and Gonogona laurifolia. These plants are characterized by their strap-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. They are often found in coastal and subalpine regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. Gonogona species have been historically used by M\u0101ori for their strong, fibrous leaves, which were used to make clothing and other crafts."
