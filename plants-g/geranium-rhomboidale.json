    "intro": "Geranium rhomboidale, commonly known as the rhombic geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, rhombic-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
