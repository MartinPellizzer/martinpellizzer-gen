    "intro": "Goniopteris oroniensis, commonly known as the Oroni fern, is a fern species native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Ecuador and Peru. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in montane forests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. The Oroni fern is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
