    "intro": "Goniophlebium ponapense, commonly known as the Pohnpei fern, is a rare and unique species native to the island of Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia. It is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like foliage with long, narrow leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures are simple, with sporangia located on the underside of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
