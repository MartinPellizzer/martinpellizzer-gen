    "intro": "Gossypium hirsutum proles yucatanense, commonly known as the Yucatan cotton, is a wild cotton species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its fibrous bolls and hairy stems, typical of the Gossypium genus. This plant thrives in warm, tropical climates and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of the Yucatan Peninsula. Its leaves are broad and lobed, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at improving cotton resilience and yield."
