    "intro": "Gentiana alpina var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are often branched and bear the showy flowers. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also significant in ecological studies of alpine ecosystems."
