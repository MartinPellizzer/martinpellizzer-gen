    "intro": "Gerascanthus borinquensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican geranium, is a flowering plant native to the island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of forests and has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small insects. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its native range."
