    "intro": "Gynura bulbosa, commonly known as the elephant's foot or bulbous euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, bulb-like stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss. Gynura bulbosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
