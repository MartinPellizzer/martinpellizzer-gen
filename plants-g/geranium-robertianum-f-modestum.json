It features small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in shaded to partially sunny conditions. It is often found in woodland areas and along the edges of forests, where it contributes to the undergrowth vegetation. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, cool environments."
