    "intro": "Grammitis schenckii, commonly known as the Schenck's filmy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, and it produces small, inconspicuous sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Grammitis schenckii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
