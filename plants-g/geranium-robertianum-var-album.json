    "intro": "Geranium robertianum var. album, commonly known as the white dead-nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. It produces small, kidney-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. The species is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively."
