    "intro": "Glyceria aquatica subsp. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving watergrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide and arranged in dense tufts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered at the base of the stems, often submerged or partially submerged in water. It thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, such as marshes and pond margins. Due to its preference for low-light conditions, it is often found in shaded, moist areas where other aquatic plants may not grow as vigorously."
