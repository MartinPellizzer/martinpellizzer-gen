    "intro": "Grammica woodsonii, commonly known as the Woodson's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is native to the southeastern United States. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or pale yellow berries that are dispersed by birds. Its botanical structure includes a root-like structure called a haustorium, which attaches to the host tree's vascular system to absorb nutrients. Grammica woodsonii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects."
