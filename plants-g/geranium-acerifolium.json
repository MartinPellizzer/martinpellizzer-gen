It features palmate leaves that resemble maple leaves, with five to seven lobes and a serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers in the summer months. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking native plant species."
