It is a succulent shrub characterized by its compact, globular shape and fleshy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Globulariopsis montana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
