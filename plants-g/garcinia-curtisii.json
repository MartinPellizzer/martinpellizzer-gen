    "intro": "Garcinia curtisii, commonly known as the Malabar tamarind, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its simple, alternate, elliptic leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, fleshy fruits containing a single seed. The fruit's outer pulp is edible and has a sour taste, while the inner seed is often used in traditional medicine. Garcinia curtisii is valued for its ornamental qualities and has applications in both culinary and medicinal contexts."
