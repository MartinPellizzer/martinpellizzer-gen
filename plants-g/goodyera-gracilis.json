    "intro": "Goodyera gracilis, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and its intricate, spiral arrangement of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands, where it thrives in the dappled light of the forest understory. Goodyera gracilis has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread slowly through the forest floor. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important component of the understory flora in its native range."
