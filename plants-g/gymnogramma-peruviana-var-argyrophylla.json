It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on the fronds, which give it its common name. The plant is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Peru and Brazil. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests. Its delicate, feather-like fronds make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
