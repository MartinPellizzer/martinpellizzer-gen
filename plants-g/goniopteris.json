    "intro": "Goniopteris, commonly known as the shield fern, is a genus of ferns characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. These fronds are typically large and have a unique, segmented structure that gives them a prehistoric appearance. The leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that create a dense, feather-like pattern. Goniopteris species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps. Their prehistoric look has made them popular in paleobotanical studies and as ornamental plants."
