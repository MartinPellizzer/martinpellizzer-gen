    "intro": "Glossaspis antennifera, commonly known as the golden leaf scale, is a species of scale insect belonging to the family Coccidae. It is characterized by its small, oval body covered in a waxy, shield-like covering that reflects light, giving it a metallic appearance. The plant it infests is typically a woody species, and it feeds on sap, causing discoloration and weakening of the host plant. The insect's life cycle includes several nymphal stages, with the adult females remaining sessile on the host plant. Due to its appearance and host specificity, it is sometimes considered a minor pest in ornamental horticulture."
