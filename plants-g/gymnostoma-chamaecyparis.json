    "intro": "Gymnostoma chamaecyparis, commonly known as the creeping cedar, is a species of coniferous evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain seeds, typical of conifers. Its foliage is fragrant and often used in traditional herbal practices. The plant's ability to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils makes it well adapted to arid and coastal environments."
