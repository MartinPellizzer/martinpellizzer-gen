    "intro": "Grevillea althoferorum, commonly known as the Althofer's waratah, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its showy, red or orange-pink floral spikes that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in heathland and open forests, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowers are composed of numerous stamens surrounded by a single, showy petal-like structure, which attracts nectar-feeding birds and insects. Grevillea althoferorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms and hardy nature."
