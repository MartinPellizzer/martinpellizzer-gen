    "intro": "Gymnocarpus, commonly known as the naked fruit plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Berberidaceae. These plants are characterized by their simple, usually alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The fruits are typically naked, meaning they lack a fleshy outer covering, and are often dry and woody. Gymnocarpus species are predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded or moist environments. They are sometimes used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their ornamental value."
