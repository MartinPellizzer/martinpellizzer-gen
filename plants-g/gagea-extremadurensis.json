    "intro": "Gagea extremadurensis, commonly known as the Extremaduran gagea, is a rare flowering plant native to Spain. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is found in specific microhabitats within the Iberian Peninsula. It is a bulbous perennial that blooms in early spring, contributing to the floral diversity of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
