    "intro": "Guzmania candelabrum, commonly known as the candlestick bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem that supports a rosette of elongated, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces a vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that resembles a candle, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its foliage is often adorned with striking patterns and can vary in color depending on light conditions. Guzmania candelabrum thrives in humid, bright indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
