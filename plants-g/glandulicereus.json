    "intro": "Glandulicereus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family, Cactaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with warm climates. They are characterized by their spiny stems and nocturnal flowers that open at night, emitting a fragrant scent to attract pollinators. The flowers are typically large, showy, and come in shades of white, yellow, or pink. Glandulicereus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are well adapted to arid environments."
