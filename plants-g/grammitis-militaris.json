It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The leaves are typically bright green, with a leathery texture and a distinct, often serrated margin. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds."
