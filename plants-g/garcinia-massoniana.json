    "intro": "Garcinia massoniana, commonly known as the African mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into bright red or yellow berries. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks. Its fruit, while not as widely consumed as the mangosteen (Garcinia indica), is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The tree thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
