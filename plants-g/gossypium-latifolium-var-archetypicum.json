    "intro": "Gossypium latifolium var. archetypicum, commonly known as the broadleaf cotton, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It produces fluffy, white cotton-like fibers that are used in traditional textile production. This variety is notable for its genetic significance in the study of cotton evolution and domestication."
