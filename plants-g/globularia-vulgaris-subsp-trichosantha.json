It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant's foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
