    "intro": "Geraniospermum sericeum, commonly known as the silverleaf geraniospermum, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize surface area and conserve moisture. Geraniospermum sericeum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry landscapes."
