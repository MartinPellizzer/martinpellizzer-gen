    "intro": "Gossypium latifolium subvar. akkorense, commonly known as the broadleaf cotton, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to dry climates and thrives in well-drained soils. Its cotton-like fibers are harvested for textile use, although it is less commercially important than other cotton species. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
