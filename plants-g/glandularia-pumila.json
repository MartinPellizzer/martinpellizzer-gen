    "intro": "Glandularia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf sunflower, is a small annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and bright yellow, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters, making it a compact and ornamental species. Its glandular structures on the leaves help in reducing water loss, adapting it to arid environments. Glandularia pumila is often found in dry, rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
