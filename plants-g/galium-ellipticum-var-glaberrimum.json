    "intro": "Galium ellipticum var. glaberrimum, commonly known as the smooth bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves distinguish it from other varieties within the Galium genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
