It is a herbaceous perennial that produces tall, striking spikes of flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and has a fibrous root system. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value has led to its use in horticulture, though it remains relatively less common than other gladiolus species."
