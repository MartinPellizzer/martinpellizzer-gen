    "intro": "Galinsoga purpurea, commonly known as common galinsoga, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its small, violet-colored flowers and hairy stems, which help it to retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and it produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads."
