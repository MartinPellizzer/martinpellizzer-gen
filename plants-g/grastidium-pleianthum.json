    "intro": "Grastidium pleianthum, commonly known as the silverleaf starwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and purple, typically blooming in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soils. Grastidium pleianthum is often found in rocky outcrops and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties."
