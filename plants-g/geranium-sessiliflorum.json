    "intro": "Geranium sessiliflorum, commonly known as the rock geranium, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems covered in dense, grayish-white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers with five petals, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Geranium sessiliflorum is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy and low-maintenance garden plant."
