    "intro": "Gnaphalium weddellianum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf feather grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of tiny, fluffy white to pale yellow flowers that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its soft, feathery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, attractive ground covers in gardens and natural landscapes."
