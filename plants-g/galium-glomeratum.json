    "intro": "Galium glomeratum, commonly known as clustered bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered in fine hairs. Galium glomeratum is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators."
