    "intro": "Galium octophyllum, commonly known as the eight-leaf wood-rye, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by small, three-lobed berries. Galium octophyllum typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage and flowers contribute to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
