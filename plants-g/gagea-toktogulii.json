    "intro": "Gagea toktogulii, commonly known as the Tolkynsky gagea, is a rare flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its bulbs are underground and serve as storage organs, enabling the plant to survive in harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
