    "intro": "Gagea soleimani, commonly known as the Persian spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often persist through the winter, providing a striking contrast to the flowering stems. Gagea soleimani is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
