    "intro": "Gossypium virens, commonly known as green cotton, is a species of cotton plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its green, fibrous boll that encases the seeds, distinguishing it from other cotton varieties. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has alternate, ovate leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, and it produces fluffy, white fibers that are harvested for textile use. Gossypium virens is less commonly cultivated than other cotton species but is valued for its unique fiber properties."
