    "intro": "Geranium aureum, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that resemble ivy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in hanging baskets or as ground cover. Geranium aureum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
