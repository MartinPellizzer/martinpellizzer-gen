    "intro": "Goniopteris liebmannii, commonly known as the Liebmann's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, narrow segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
