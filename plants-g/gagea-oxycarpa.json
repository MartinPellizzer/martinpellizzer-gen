    "intro": "Gagea oxycarpa, commonly known as the sharp-lobed gagea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces a single, elongated bulb that stores nutrients for the next growing season. It typically blooms in early spring and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Gagea oxycarpa is often found in woodland and open habitats, preferring partial shade to full sun."
