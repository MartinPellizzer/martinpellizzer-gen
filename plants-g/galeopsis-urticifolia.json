    "intro": "Galeopsis urticifolia, commonly known as hedge nettle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows up to 60 cm in height, with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are slightly hairy and have a mild, somewhat peppery taste, while the stems are square and often reddish in color. Galeopsis urticifolia is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
