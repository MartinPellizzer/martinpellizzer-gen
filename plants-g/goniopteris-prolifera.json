    "intro": "Goniopteris prolifera, commonly known as the creeping water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and the production of small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The fronds are pinnate, with a distinctive bifurcating structure that gives the plant its unique appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in stream banks and wetlands. This fern is also notable for its ability to reproduce vegetatively through rhizome fragmentation, which contributes to its widespread distribution in tropical and subtropical regions."
