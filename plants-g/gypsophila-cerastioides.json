    "intro": "Gypsophila cerastioides, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Gypsophila cerastioides is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
