    "intro": "Goniolimon sewerzowii, commonly known as the Turkmenian sand-rose, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is a member of the Plumbaginaceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
