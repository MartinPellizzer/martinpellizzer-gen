It features small, glossy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of white flowers in the spring. The plant is notable for its bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. These fruits are often used in jams and desserts due to their unique taste. Gaultheria laevigata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
