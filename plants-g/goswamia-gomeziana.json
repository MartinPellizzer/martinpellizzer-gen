    "intro": "Goswamia gomeziana, commonly known as the Gomeziana orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks, and requires specific conditions to thrive. Its leaves are lance-shaped and glossy, while its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Goswamia gomeziana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
