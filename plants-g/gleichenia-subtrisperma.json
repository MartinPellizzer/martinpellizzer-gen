    "intro": "Gleichenia subtrisperma, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a member of the Gleicheniaceae family. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, forming dense mats on the forest floor. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Gleichenia subtrisperma thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate and tropical regions."
