    "intro": "Geranium uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features upright stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are usually rounded or heart-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge. Geranium uniflorum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
