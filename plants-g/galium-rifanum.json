    "intro": "Galium rifanum, commonly known as the rifan marsh bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small, white or pinkish flowers appear in clusters, and the leaves are opposite, simple, and often hairy. Galium rifanum is characterized by its ability to tolerate wet conditions and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
