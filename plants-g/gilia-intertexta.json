    "intro": "Gilia intertexta, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its slender stems and lance-shaped leaves are adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions. Gilia intertexta is often found in sandy soils and is an important nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
