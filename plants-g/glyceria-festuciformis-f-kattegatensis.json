    "intro": "Glyceria festuciformis f. kattegatensis, commonly known as the Kattegat sedge, is a rare and specialized plant native to the coastal regions of the Baltic Sea. It is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. This subspecies is adapted to brackish and saline environments, often found in wet meadows and tidal zones. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
