    "intro": "Gurania linkiana, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that supports its massive leaves and helps it stay afloat. Its flowers are typically white or pink, opening in the early morning and closing by midday. Gurania linkiana plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms and contributing to water purification."
