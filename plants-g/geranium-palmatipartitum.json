    "intro": "Geranium palmatipartitum, commonly known as the broad-leaved geranium, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It features large, palmately lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, almost palm-like appearance, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its visual appeal and texture. Geranium palmatipartitum prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for gardens."
