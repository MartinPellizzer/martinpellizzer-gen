    "intro": "Gyrostachys gracilis, commonly known as the slender sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Gyrostachys gracilis is adapted to hot, dry climates and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
