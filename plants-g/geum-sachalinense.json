    "intro": "Geum sachalinense, commonly known as the Sakhalin avens, is a flowering plant native to the Far East, including regions of Russia, Japan, and Korea. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, temperate climates, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a distinctive, hairy texture that helps it retain moisture. Geum sachalinense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
