    "intro": "Gouldia sandwicensis var. stipulacea, commonly known as the Hawaiian gouldia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and showy, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. It has small, scale-like leaves and produces clustered inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
