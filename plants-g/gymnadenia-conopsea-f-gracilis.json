    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender cowplant, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits a unique morphology compared to its more common relatives. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
