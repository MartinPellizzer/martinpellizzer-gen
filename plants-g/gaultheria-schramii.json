    "intro": "Gaultheria schramii, commonly known as the Schramm's wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its high-altitude habitat. The plant is also noted for its aromatic leaves, which contain compounds similar to those found in wintergreen oil."
