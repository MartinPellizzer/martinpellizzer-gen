    "intro": "Grammitis deliculata, commonly known as the delicate fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of its leaves. Grammitis deliculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
