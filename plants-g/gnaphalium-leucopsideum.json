    "intro": "Gnaphalium leucopsideum, commonly known as silverleaf ragwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish to white flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called capitula. Its leaves are typically silver-gray in color, covered in fine, silky hairs that help reduce water loss. The species is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
