    "intro": "Grammitis leucosora, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with prominent white veins. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Grammitis leucosora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
