    "intro": "Gorinkia, commonly known as the Chinese lantern or Physostigma verticillata, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Gorinkia is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
