    "intro": "Galactia stenophylla var. virgata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces cylindrical, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Galactia stenophylla var. virgata is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
