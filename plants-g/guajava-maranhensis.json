    "intro": "Guajava maranhensis, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Eugenia uniflora*, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are edible and have a sweet, tart flavor. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are often used in jams, juices, and desserts. Guajava maranhensis thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
