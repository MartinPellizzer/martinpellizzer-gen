    "intro": "Gesneria subalata, commonly known as the silver-veined gesneria, is a tropical flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, silver-veined leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria subalata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
