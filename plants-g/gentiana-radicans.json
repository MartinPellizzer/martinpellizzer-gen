    "intro": "Gentiana radicans, commonly known as the creeping gentian, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread across the ground. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. Its leaves are dark green, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its root system is fibrous and adapted to moist, well-drained soils. Gentiana radicans is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
