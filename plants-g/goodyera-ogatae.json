    "intro": "Goodyera ogatae, commonly known as the Japanese lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its distinctive, dark green, pleated leaves. The plant produces a dense spike of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Goodyera ogatae is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks rather than in soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often protected in its native environment."
