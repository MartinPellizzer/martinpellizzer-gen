    "intro": "Gastrodia wuyishanensis, commonly known as the Wuyi Mountain gastrodia, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Wuyi Mountains in Fujian Province, China. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces unique, fleshy, yellowish-brown tubers that are highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in cool, shaded forest environments with high humidity. Due to habitat destruction and overharvesting, its population has drastically declined, making conservation efforts critical for its survival."
