    "intro": "Galium densum, commonly known as densebed silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Galium densum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
