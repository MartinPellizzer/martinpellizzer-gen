    "intro": "Guapira neblinensis, commonly known as the misty guapira, is a small evergreen tree native to the cloud forests of Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
