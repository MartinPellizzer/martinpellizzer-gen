    "intro": "Geranium sibbaldioides, commonly known as the sibbaldii geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features upright, branched stems that bear opposite, palmately lobed leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
