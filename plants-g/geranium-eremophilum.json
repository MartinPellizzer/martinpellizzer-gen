    "intro": "Geranium eremophilum, commonly known as the desert geranium, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy texture, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, often with a silvery or grayish underside, adapted to reflect sunlight and conserve moisture. Geranium eremophilum is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
