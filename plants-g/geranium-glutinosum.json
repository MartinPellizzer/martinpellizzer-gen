    "intro": "Geranium glutinosum, commonly known as sticky geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive sticky texture. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its sticky secretions on leaves and stems help deter herbivores and reduce water loss. Geranium glutinosum thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded to partially sunny environments."
