    "intro": "Gymnadenia corneliana var. bourneriasii, commonly known as the Bourneriasii grass of parnassus, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
