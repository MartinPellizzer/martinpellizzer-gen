    "intro": "Gynoxys buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf gynoxys, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features dense, leathery leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape, often with a reddish or purplish hue on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in some botanical gardens and conservation programs."
