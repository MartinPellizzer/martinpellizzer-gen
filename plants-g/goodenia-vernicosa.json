    "intro": "Goodenia vernicosa, commonly known as the silky goodenia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its leaves are covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving them a silky appearance, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in spring and attract various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
