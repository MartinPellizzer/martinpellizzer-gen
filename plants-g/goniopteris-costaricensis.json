    "intro": "Goniopteris costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican fern, is a species of tree fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant has a slender, unbranched trunk that is covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. Its fronds can grow up to several meters in length, with a distinctive, leathery texture and a wavy margin. Goniopteris costaricensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
