    "intro": "Geranium hirtum, commonly known as the hairy geranium, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern and eastern Africa. It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy textures, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming from spring to autumn. Its leaves are usually rounded or heart-shaped, with a rough, serrated edge. Geranium hirtum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
