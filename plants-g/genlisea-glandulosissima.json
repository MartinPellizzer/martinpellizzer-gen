    "intro": "Genlisea glandulosissima, commonly known as the glandular bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Lentibacillaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor soils, often in marshy or swampy areas. Its leaves are modified into specialized structures that form the trapping mechanisms. Genlisea glandulosissima is notable for its ability to digest insects, providing it with essential nutrients in its environment."
