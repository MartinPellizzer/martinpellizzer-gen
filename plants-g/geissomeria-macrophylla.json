    "intro": "Geissomeria macrophylla, commonly known as the showy gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are typically hairy and have a serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, orange-red berries in the summer. Its botanical features include a woody stem with thorny branches and a preference for well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
