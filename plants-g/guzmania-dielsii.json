    "intro": "Guzmania dielsii, commonly known as the Diels' bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. Its roots are adapted for absorbing nutrients from the air and debris around it, rather than soil. Guzmania dielsii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
