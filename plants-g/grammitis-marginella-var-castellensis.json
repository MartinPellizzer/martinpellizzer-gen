It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a distinctive margin that is rolled under, giving it a unique appearance. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences."
