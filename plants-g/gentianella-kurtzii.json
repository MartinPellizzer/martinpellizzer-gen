    "intro": "Gentianella kurtzii, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Alps and adjacent regions. It features a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Gentianella kurtzii thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
