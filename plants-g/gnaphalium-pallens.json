    "intro": "Gnaphalium pallens, commonly known as the silverleaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its leaves are silver-gray in color, covered with fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and ornamental appearance."
