    "intro": "Gossypium darwinii, commonly known as Darwin's cotton, is a species of shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woolly, hairy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant produces small, round capsules that contain numerous fibrous seeds, similar to other cotton species. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates. Due to its unique adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
