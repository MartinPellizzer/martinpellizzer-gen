    "intro": "Gymnogramma elongata var. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian kidney fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bi-lobed fronds that give it a distinctive, almost kidney-shaped appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates like soil or rock. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, making it a visually appealing and hardy ornamental plant."
