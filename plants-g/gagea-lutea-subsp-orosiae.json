    "intro": "Gagea lutea subsp. orosiae, commonly known as the alpine gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its bulbs are adapted for storage, allowing it to survive harsh winter climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas."
