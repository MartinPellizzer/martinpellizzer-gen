    "intro": "Gilia prolifera, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that grows from 10 to 30 centimeters in height, featuring slender stems and clusters of small, showy flowers. The flowers are typically bright red or orange, with five petals and a distinctive spur at the base, which aids in pollination by attracting specific insects. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for desert wildlife."
