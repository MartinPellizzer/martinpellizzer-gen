    "intro": "Gingidium enysii var. spathulatum, commonly known as the Enys' ginger or the broad-leaf ginger, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers and related plants. The plant is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
