    "intro": "Gentiana clausa f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered gentian, is a rare and striking plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, known for its vibrant blue or purple flowers, but this particular form is distinguished by its white petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a showy display that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
