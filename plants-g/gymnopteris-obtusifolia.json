    "intro": "Gymnopteris obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically bipinnate, with a soft, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Gymnopteris obtusifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
