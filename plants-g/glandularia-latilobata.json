    "intro": "Glandularia latilobata, commonly known as the broad-lobed glandularia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a compact cluster, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and chaparral. Glandularia latilobata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
