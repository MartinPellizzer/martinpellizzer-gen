    "intro": "Glechoma crinita, commonly known as hairy ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. It spreads rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats on the ground. Glechoma crinita is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and along stream banks."
