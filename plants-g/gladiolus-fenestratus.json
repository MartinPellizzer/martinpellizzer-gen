    "intro": "Gladiolus fenestratus, commonly known as the windowed gladiolus, is a striking herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear large, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant's most distinctive feature is its foliage, which has a unique fenestrated or 'windowed' appearance due to the presence of leaf gaps. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value has led to the development of numerous cultivars in horticulture."
