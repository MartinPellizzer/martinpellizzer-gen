    "intro": "Gaillonia macrantha, commonly known as the giant flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy red bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered within the vibrant bracts, adding to its visual appeal. Gaillonia macrantha thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical and subtropical regions."
