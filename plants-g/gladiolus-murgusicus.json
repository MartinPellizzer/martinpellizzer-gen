    "intro": "Gladiolus murgusicus, commonly known as the Murgus mountain gladiolus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, upright stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing vibrant pink to purple petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while its rhizomes contribute to its perennial growth habit. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
