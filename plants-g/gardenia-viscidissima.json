It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from yellow to red as they mature. It prefers warm, humid climates and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens. Its sticky sap, which gives it its common name, can be used in traditional medicine."
