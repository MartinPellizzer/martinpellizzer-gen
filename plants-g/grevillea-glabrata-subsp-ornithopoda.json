    "intro": "Grevillea glabrata subsp. ornithopoda, commonly known as the pink wattle, is a shrub native to western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and striking red or pink floral spikes that appear in late summer. The plant produces small, nectar-rich flowers that attract a variety of pollinators, including birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. The subspecies is closely related to other Grevillea species and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat."
