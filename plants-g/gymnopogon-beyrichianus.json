    "intro": "Gymnopogon beyrichianus, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, while its flowers are wind-pollinated. Gymnopogon beyrichianus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
