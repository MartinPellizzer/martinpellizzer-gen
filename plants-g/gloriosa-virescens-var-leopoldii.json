It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red flowers with a distinctive yellow throat, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features long, strap-like leaves that are dark green and glossy, adding to its visual appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.
