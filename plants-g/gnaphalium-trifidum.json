    "intro": "Gnaphalium trifidum, commonly known as the three-lobed cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Gnaphalium trifidum is also noted for its aromatic foliage, which releases a fine, powdery substance when disturbed."
