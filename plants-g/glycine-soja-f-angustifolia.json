    "intro": "Glycine soja f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf soybean, is a botanical variant of the soybean plant characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. It is a leguminous species native to East Asia, particularly China, and is adapted to temperate climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds, which are used in traditional cuisines. Its narrow leaves distinguish it from the more common broad-leaf soybean varieties. This form is often cultivated for its nutritional value and agricultural versatility."
