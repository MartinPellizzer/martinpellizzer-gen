    "intro": "Glomera geminata, commonly known as the twin-flowered glomera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth, glossy surface and a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white and pink, during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, making it well adapted to moist, well-drained soils. Glomera geminata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and pleasant fragrance."
