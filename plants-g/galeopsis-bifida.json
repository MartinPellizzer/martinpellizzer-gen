    "intro": "Galeopsis bifida, commonly known as narrowleaf horseweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Galeopsis bifida is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny environments."
