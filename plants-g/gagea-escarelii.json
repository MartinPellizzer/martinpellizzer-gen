    "intro": "Gagea escarelii, commonly known as the Escarelli's spring beauty, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is characterized by its delicate, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bulbous structures called bulbs, which are used for storage and reproduction. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Gagea escarelii is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is noted for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native range."
