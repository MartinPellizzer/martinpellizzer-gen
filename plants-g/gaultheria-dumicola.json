    "intro": "Gaultheria dumicola, commonly known as the dwarf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its often harsh coastal environment. Gaultheria dumicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils."
