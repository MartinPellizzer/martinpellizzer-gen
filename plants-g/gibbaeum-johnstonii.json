    "intro": "Gibbaeum johnstonii, commonly known as the Johnston's cushion plant, is a small, mat-forming succulent native to southern Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
