    "intro": "Gossypium sarmentosum, commonly known as the hairy cotton or wild cotton, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces fluffy, white seeds surrounded by a fibrous capsule, similar to other cotton species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its fibrous seeds, it has been historically used for fiber and as a source of natural dyes."
