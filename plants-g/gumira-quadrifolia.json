    "intro": "Gumira quadrifolia, commonly known as the four-leafed gumira, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, Gumira quadrifolia is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
