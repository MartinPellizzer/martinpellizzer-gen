    "intro": "Gypsophila pilosa var. pilosa, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and clusters of small, fluffy white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant gardens."
