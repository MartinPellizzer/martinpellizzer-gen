    "intro": "Gordonia acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beech, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hair. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by clusters of small, dark blue berries. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in shaded forest environments. Gordonia acutifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
