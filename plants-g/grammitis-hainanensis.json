    "intro": "Grammitis hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of China, particularly Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Grammitis hainanensis thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forests and rocky areas. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
