    "intro": "Galinsoga quadriradiata, commonly known as common galinsoga, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces numerous tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a weed in many regions."
