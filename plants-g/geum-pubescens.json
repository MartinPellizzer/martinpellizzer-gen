    "intro": "Geum pubescens, commonly known as the downy buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine, soft hairs. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant's rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
