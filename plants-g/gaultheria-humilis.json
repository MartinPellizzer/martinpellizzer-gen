    "intro": "Gaultheria humilis, commonly known as the dwarf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves, which contain methyl salicylate, giving it a wintergreen scent. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Gaultheria humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its medicinal properties."
