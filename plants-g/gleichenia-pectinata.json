    "intro": "Gleichenia pectinata, commonly known as the hairpin fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, long, narrow fronds that are often divided into smaller, overlapping segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Gleichenia pectinata is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
