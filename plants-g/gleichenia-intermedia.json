    "intro": "Gleichenia intermedia, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a vascular fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically 30\u2013100 cm long, with a dark green, glossy appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a distinctive feature of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Gleichenia intermedia is widely distributed across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
