    "intro": "Galium thymifolium, commonly known as thyme-leaved bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that resemble those of thyme. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and the leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs. Galium thymifolium is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
