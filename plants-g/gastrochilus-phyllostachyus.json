It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
