    "intro": "Goniophlebium pellitum, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand drought and has a low-growing habit to reduce water loss."
