    "intro": "Gossypium jamaicense f. fruticulosum, commonly known as the Jamaican cotton or wild cotton, is a botanical variant of the cotton genus native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, woolly leaves, which contribute to its unique appearance. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain fibrous seeds, typical of the cotton family. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its historical significance and genetic diversity, it is of interest to botanists and plant breeders."
