    "intro": "Gossypium teleium, commonly known as the desert cotton, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. The plant is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and small, pale yellow flowers. Its fibrous seed pods contain cotton-like fibers, though they are not commercially cultivated for textile production. Gossypium teleium is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it an important plant in ecological studies of desert ecosystems."
