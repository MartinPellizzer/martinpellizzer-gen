It features slender, wiry stems that are typically covered in a grayish-white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. This variety is well adapted to poor, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and limestone areas."
