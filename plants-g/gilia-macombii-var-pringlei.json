    "intro": "Gilia macombii var. pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
