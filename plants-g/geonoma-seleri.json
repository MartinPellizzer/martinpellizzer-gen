    "intro": "Geonoma seleri, commonly known as the Seler's bryophyte fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are typically composed of small, overlapping pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Geonoma seleri plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
