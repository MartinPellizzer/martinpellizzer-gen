It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its striking copper-colored leaves that resemble copper coins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
