    "intro": "Goodyera brevis, commonly known as the broad-leafed maidenhair, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, rhizomatous growth habit and dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish flowers arranged in a spike, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Goodyera brevis thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and thickets."
