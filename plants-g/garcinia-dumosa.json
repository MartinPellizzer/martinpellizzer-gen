    "intro": "Garcinia dumosa, commonly known as the African star apple or wild mango, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fruit that is typically green when unripe and turns red when mature. The fruit has a thick, leathery skin and contains a single large seed surrounded by a juicy, white pulp. Garcinia dumosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some African cultures."
