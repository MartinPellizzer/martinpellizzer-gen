    "intro": "Geranium diffusum var. genuinum, commonly known as the spreading geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive reddish or purple tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
