The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing clusters of pink or white flowers that resemble clouds or lace. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of high-altitude flora."
