    "intro": "Gesneria mortonii, commonly known as the Morton's gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the humid lowland forests of western Africa. It features glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, upright cluster. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Gesneria mortonii is prized for its ornamental value and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
