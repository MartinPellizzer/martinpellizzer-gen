    "intro": "Galium rotundifolium var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive woodypox, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, round leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its delicate appearance and habitat preferences, it is often found in forest understories where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
