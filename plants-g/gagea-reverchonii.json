    "intro": "Gagea reverchonii, commonly known as the Reverchon's starflower, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces a single, star-shaped flower that typically blooms in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
