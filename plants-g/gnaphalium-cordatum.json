    "intro": "Gnaphalium cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf cudweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, spoon-shaped leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender, hairy stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Its aromatic leaves and flowering heads make it a notable species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
