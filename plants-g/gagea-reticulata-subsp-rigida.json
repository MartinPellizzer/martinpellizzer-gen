    "intro": "Gagea reticulata subsp. rigida, commonly known as the rigid netted squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its distinctive reticulate pattern on the bulb, which gives it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
