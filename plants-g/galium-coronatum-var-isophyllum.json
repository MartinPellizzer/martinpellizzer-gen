    "intro": "Galium coronatum var. isophyllum, commonly known as the small-fruited bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers, which are followed by small, bladder-like fruits. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
