    "intro": "Galearia minor, commonly known as the small rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats or small clusters. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and its flowers are yellow or white, often appearing in early spring. Galearia minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, high-altitude conditions."
