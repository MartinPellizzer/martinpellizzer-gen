    "intro": "Glandularia incisa, commonly known as the narrowleaf glandularia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Verbenaceae and is characterized by its glandular leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are often covered in tiny, glandular hairs that secrete oils, which can deter herbivores. The flowers, which range in color from pink to purple, bloom in late spring to early summer."
