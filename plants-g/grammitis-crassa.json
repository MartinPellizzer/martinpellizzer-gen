    "intro": "Grammitis crassa, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its robust, dark green fronds that are typically broad and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small clusters called sori. Grammitis crassa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It is a relatively hardy plant that can thrive in a variety of soil types as long as it remains consistently damp."
