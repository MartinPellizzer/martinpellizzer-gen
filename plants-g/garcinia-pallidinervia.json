    "intro": "Garcinia pallidinervia, commonly known as the white-veined garcinia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves with prominent, pale yellow veins that contrast with the dark green foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Garcinia pallidinervia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
