    "intro": "Gesneria aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange gesneria, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to southern Brazil. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces striking orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria aurantiaca is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
