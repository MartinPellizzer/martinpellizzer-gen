    "intro": "Goniopteris venusta var. usitata, commonly known as the common water fern, is a variant of the genus Goniopteris, characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance that enhances its ornamental value. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. It is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
