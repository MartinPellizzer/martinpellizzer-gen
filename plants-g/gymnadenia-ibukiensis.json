    "intro": "Gymnadenia ibukiensis, commonly known as the Ibuki grass-pink, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and striking, pale pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. It is known for its small, clustered inflorescences and has a short flowering period during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gymnadenia ibukiensis is considered a vulnerable species."
