    "intro": "Gymnocarpium continentale, commonly known as the European water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. Its flowers are small and yellow, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces distinctive, smooth, seed-containing fruits called achenes. Gymnocarpium continentale plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
