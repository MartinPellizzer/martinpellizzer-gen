    "intro": "Gilia bolanderi, commonly known as the Bolander's gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky habitats, such as cliffs and talus slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It belongs to the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is known for its showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
