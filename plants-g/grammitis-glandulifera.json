    "intro": "Grammitis glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular grammitis, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia that are clustered in sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The species is notable for its glandular structures on the fronds, which may play a role in water retention or defense against herbivores."
