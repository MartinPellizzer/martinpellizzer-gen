    "intro": "Galium heuffelii, commonly known as the Heuffel's bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many flowering plants known for their showy blooms. The plant features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in whorls along the stems, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. Galium heuffelii is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
