It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming a dense mat on the ground. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-white flower heads, which are surrounded by pale green to white bracts. Its leaves are linear to oblanceolate, with a hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stems. This subspecies is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
