    "intro": "Gumira mollissima, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Gumira mollissima is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in some regions."
