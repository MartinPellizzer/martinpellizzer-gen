    "intro": "Genista triangularis, commonly known as the triangular broom, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are triangular in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
