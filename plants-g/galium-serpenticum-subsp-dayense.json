    "intro": "Galium serpenticum subsp. dayense, commonly known as the serpentine bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to certain regions of North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant typically thrives in nutrient-poor, calcareous or serpentine soils, which are often found in rocky or mountainous areas. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare or endangered species in many parts of its range."
