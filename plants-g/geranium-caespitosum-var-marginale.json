It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize dune environments."
