    "intro": "Gnaphalium paramorum, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces fluffy, white or pale yellow blooms that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. It thrives in high altitudes and is adapted to cold, dry environments. Its foliage is typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh mountain conditions."
