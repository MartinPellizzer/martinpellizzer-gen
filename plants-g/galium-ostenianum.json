    "intro": "Galium ostenianum, commonly known as silverweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped or ovate, and the plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks or in woodland areas. Galium ostenianum is known for its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense mats that can help prevent soil erosion."
