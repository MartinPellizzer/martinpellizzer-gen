    "intro": "Gomphia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gomphia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many species adapted to arid and coastal environments. The plant features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a fibrous, woody base. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Gomphia lanceolata is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in harsh, coastal or mountainous conditions."
