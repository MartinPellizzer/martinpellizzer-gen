    "intro": "Grevillea rhizomatosa, commonly known as the red flowering grevillea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright red flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the warmer months. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Grevillea rhizomatosa is known for its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
