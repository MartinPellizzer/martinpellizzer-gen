    "intro": "Grindelia nana var. integerrima, commonly known as the dwarf gumweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact stature, with hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a rough texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Grindelia nana var. integerrima is often found in disturbed soils and coastal areas, demonstrating adaptability to harsh conditions."
