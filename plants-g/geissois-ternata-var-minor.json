    "intro": "Geissois ternata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser geissois, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, bloom in spring and attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
