    "intro": "Gnomonia ovina var. supina, commonly known as the creeping woolly shield fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on the underside of its fronds, which provides protection against desiccation and herbivory. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
