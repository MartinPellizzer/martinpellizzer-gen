    "intro": "Grammitis loheriana, commonly known as the Loher's spikemoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperjaniales. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and the presence of small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in spore-producing clusters called strobila. Grammitis loheriana is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
