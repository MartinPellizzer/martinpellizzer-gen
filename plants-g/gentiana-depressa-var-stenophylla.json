    "intro": "Gentiana depressa var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gentian, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This variant is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to its harsh, mountainous habitat."
