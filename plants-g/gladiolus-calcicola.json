    "intro": "Gladiolus calcicola, commonly known as the limestone gladiolus, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. The plant produces tall, upright stems with showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
