    "intro": "Galium glomeratum var. bovei, commonly known as the Bove's bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, while the flowers are white or pale pink and arranged in dense clusters. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Galium glomeratum."
