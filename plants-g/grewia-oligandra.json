It features small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature. Grewia oligandra is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and drought tolerance."
