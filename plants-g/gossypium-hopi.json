    "intro": "Gossypium hopi, commonly known as the Hopi cotton, is a wild cotton species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub-like plant that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, featuring small, narrow leaves and fluffy, white cotton bolls. The plant produces fibers that are similar to those of domesticated cotton, though they are less commonly used commercially. Gossypium hopi is valued for its ecological role in desert ecosystems and its potential for genetic diversity in cotton breeding programs. Its fibrous seeds are also used by indigenous communities for traditional purposes."
