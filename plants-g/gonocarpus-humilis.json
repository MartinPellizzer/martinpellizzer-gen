    "intro": "Gonocarpus humilis, commonly known as the lowland sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its structure consists of triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, with small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into three-lobed, berry-like fruits. Gonocarpus humilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystems."
