    "intro": "Gutenbergia cordifolia var. marginata, commonly known as the marginate heartleaf, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or cream-colored margin, which sets it apart from other varieties of the species. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 feet, and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its unique foliage and moderate care requirements, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking both aesthetic appeal and botanical interest."
