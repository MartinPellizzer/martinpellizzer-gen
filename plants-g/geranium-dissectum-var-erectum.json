    "intro": "Geranium dissectum var. erectum, commonly known as the upright geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright, slender stems that bear opposite, palmately lobed leaves with finely cut margins. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
