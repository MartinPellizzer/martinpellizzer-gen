    "intro": "Glyceria occidentalis, commonly known as western glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. Its ability to thrive in saturated soils makes it a valuable species for wetland restoration projects."
