    "intro": "Genipella, commonly known as the false guava, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are shrubs or small trees, characterized by their opposite, simple leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The fruits are typically small, fleshy, and sometimes edible, though their flavor can vary among species. Genipella species are often used in traditional medicine and have ornamental value due to their attractive foliage and blooms."
