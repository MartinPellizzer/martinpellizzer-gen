    "intro": "Glechoma hederacea var. grandifolia, commonly known as greater ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, slightly wrinkled leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its creeping growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, often forming dense mats over the ground. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is commonly found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
