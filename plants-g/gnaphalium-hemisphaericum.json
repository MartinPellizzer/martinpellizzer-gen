It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small yellow flowers. The plant produces fine, silky hairs on its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its flowers bloom in spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
