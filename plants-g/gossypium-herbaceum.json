    "intro": "Gossypium herbaceum, commonly known as wild cotton, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its soft, fluffy seeds encased in a fibrous capsule. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and broad, lobed leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces capsules that contain the fluffy cotton fibers used for fiber production. Gossypium herbaceum is often found in disturbed soils and is an important wild relative of cultivated cotton species."
