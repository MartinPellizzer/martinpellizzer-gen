    "intro": "Godoya gemmiflora, commonly known as the gemmed tree, is a unique plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody structure and the presence of gemmae, which are small, vegetative propagules that allow for asexual reproduction. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are simple and alternate, often with a slightly hairy surface. Godoya gemmiflora is valued for its ornamental potential and ecological importance in its native habitat."
