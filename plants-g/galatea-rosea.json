    "intro": "Galatea rosea, commonly known as the pink milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pink to lavender-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a distinguishing feature. Galatea rosea plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
