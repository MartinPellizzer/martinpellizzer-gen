    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea var. lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland cow-wheat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale yellow or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as bogs, heaths, and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, tubular flowers that are adapted for pollination by insects. This variety is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Gymnadenia conopsea."
