    "intro": "Gentiana excisa subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
