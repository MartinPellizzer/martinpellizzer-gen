    "intro": "Gazania diffusa, commonly known as the common gazania, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in response to sunlight. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Gazania diffusa is known for its drought tolerance and ability to reseed itself, contributing to its widespread presence in its native habitat."
