    "intro": "Graphorkis dabia, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white\u7ed2\u6bdb, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Graphorkis dabia is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
