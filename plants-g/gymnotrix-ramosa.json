It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant has a thalloid structure with a flat, ribbon-like body that is often branched. Its reproductive structures, called sporophytes, are small and clustered on the thallus. Gymnotrix ramosa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
