It is characterized by its bright red, orange, and yellow berries that remain on the plant throughout the winter, providing visual interest. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by the vibrant berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in moist, rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color."
