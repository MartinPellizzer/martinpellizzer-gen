    "intro": "Grevillea oldei, commonly known as the Oldfield's waratah, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and its showy, crimson-red flower spikes that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody, red-brown seed pods, which are distinctive in appearance. Grevillea oldei is well adapted to sandy soils and is drought-tolerant once established. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its vibrant flowers and hardy nature."
