    "intro": "Goniophlebium pachynevron, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a complex system of veins that aid in its buoyancy and nutrient absorption in water. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems."
