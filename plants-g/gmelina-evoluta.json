    "intro": "Gmelina evoluta, commonly known as the waling-waling, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Gmelina evoluta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
