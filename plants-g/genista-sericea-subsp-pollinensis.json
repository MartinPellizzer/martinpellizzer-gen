    "intro": "Genista sericea subsp. pollinensis, commonly known as the Alpine broom, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to harsh, alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is often found in rocky or gravelly areas at high altitudes."
