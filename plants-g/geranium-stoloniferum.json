    "intro": "Geranium stoloniferum, commonly known as creeping geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that produce clusters of pink or red flowers, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with scalloped edges and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that can suppress weeds. Geranium stoloniferum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade conditions."
