It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender stems that are often prostrate or ascending, covered with stiff, glandular hairs. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a rough, sandpapery texture. Small white or pale yellow flowers appear in clusters during the summer, followed by small, bladder-like fruits."
