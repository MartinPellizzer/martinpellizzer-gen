    "intro": "Grammica australis subsp. tineoi, commonly known as the Australian grammic, is a small shrub native to the south-western regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its habitat."
