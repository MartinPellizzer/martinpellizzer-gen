    "intro": "Galeandra greenwoodiana, commonly known as the greenwood's galeandra, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, loose soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and vibrant coloration make it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
