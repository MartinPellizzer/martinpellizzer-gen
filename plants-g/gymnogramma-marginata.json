    "intro": "Gymnogramma marginata, commonly known as the marginate holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Gymnogramma marginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
