It is characterized by its small, thornless leaves and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in summer, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. This variety is particularly suited for smaller gardens or urban environments due to its manageable size."
