It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. Its bark is thick and corky, providing some resistance to pests and diseases. Guarea macrophylla is often found in lowland tropical rainforests and is valued for its ecological and potential medicinal properties."
