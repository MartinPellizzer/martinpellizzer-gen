    "intro": "Geranium paludosum, commonly known as the swamp geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features upright stems that bear opposite, palmately lobed leaves with a rough texture. Its showy flowers are usually pink to purple, with five petals and a distinctive spur at the base of each petal. Geranium paludosum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
