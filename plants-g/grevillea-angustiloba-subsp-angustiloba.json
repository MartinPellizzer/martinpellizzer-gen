    "intro": "Grevillea angustiloba subsp. angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grevillea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically grey-green in color, and it produces striking, bottlebrush-like flowers in shades of red and orange. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its relatively narrow leaves compared to other members of the Grevillea genus."
