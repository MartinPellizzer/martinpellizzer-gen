    "intro": "Gastrodia javanica f. thalassina, commonly known as the sea gastrodia, is a rare and unique variant of the gastrodia plant. It is characterized by its distinct morphological features, including a more elongated and robust rhizome compared to the typical form. The plant exhibits a specialized adaptation to coastal environments, with a thicker cuticle to reduce water loss in saline conditions. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, typical of the Orchidaceae family. This fern-like plant is primarily found in coastal regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in sandy soils and humid climates."
