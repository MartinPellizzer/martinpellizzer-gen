    "intro": "[WRONG START] Gelonia pycnantherum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pycnanthera, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern Cape Province of South Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and compact, rounded growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in terminal clusters during the winter months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
