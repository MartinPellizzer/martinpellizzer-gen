    "intro": "Genista micrantha, commonly known as the creeping yellow broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Genista micrantha thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and dry habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it both an ornamental plant and a potential weed."
