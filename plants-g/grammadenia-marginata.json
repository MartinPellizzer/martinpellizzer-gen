    "intro": "Grammadenia marginata, commonly known as the coastal daisy or coastal grammadenia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive, waxy appearance. It thrives in sandy or rocky coastal soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Grammadenia marginata plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
