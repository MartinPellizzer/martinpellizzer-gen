    "intro": "Galactophora petiolata, commonly known as the leafy milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a distinguishing feature and can cause skin irritation. Galactophora petiolata is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils."
