    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea var. borealis, commonly known as the northern red grass-violets, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking red and violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are grass-like and lance-shaped, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments. This variant is distinguished by its more northern distribution and slightly different floral morphology compared to other Gymnadenia species."
