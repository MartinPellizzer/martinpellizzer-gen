    "intro": "Guapira schomburgkiana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or the yellow guapira, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, red berries. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in musical instruments and furniture, though it is also threatened by overharvesting."
