    "intro": "Gagea pusilla var. fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant nut sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers in early spring. Its most distinctive characteristic is its fragrant, nut-like seeds, which are enclosed in a three-lobed capsule. It is often found in association with other wetland plants and plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat for small invertebrates."
