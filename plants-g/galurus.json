    "intro": "Galurus, commonly known as the red alder, is a deciduous tree native to the western regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and its distinctive reddish-brown bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind. Galurus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streams."
