    "intro": "Goodyera hispida, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Goodyera hispida typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
