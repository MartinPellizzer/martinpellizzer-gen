    "intro": "Gamocarpha macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed gamocarpha, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like composite flowers that consist of yellow disk florets surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.
