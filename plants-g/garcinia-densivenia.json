    "intro": "Garcinia densivenia, commonly known as the dense-veined garcinia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with prominent, dense veins that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are edible but contain toxic seeds. Garcinia densivenia is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and vibrant fruit. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is commonly found in lowland rainforests."
