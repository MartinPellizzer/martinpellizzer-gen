    "intro": "Gladiolus versicolor var. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved gladiolus, is a striking ornamental plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems that bear dense clusters of colorful, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The variety is distinguished by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of typical gladiolus species. Its flowers are typically arranged in racemes, adding a dramatic visual impact to gardens. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for floral arrangements and landscape design."
