    "intro": "Goniothalamus tenuifolius var. arborescens, commonly known as the slender-leafed goniothalamus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often narrowly elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it bears yellowish-orange berries that contain seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
