    "intro": "Gaultheria serpyllifolia, commonly known as the creeping wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, glossy dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans and birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. Gaultheria serpyllifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in woodland settings."
