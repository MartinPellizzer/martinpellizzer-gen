    "intro": "Galarhoeus apios, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in dry environments. Galarhoeus apios is often found in rocky soils and is considered a drought-tolerant species."
