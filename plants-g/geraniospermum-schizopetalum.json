    "intro": "Geraniospermum schizopetalum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and alternate, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, with five petals and a hairy calyx. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and water-storing tissues. Geraniospermum schizopetalum is also known for its latex-like sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
