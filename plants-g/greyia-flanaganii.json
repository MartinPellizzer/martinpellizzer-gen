    "intro": "Greyia flanaganii, commonly known as the Flanagan's greyia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal climates. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a slightly aromatic scent when crushed. Greyia flanaganii is often found in rocky habitats and is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
