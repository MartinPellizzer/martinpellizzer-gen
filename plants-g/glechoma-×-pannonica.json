    "intro": "Glechoma \u00d7 pannonica, commonly known as the hybrid ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Glechoma \u00d7 pannonica is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its ability to spread rapidly makes it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in cultivated areas."
