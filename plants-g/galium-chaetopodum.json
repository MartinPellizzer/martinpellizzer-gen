    "intro": "Galium chaetopodum, commonly known as hairy bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, typically blooming in early summer. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium chaetopodum is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
