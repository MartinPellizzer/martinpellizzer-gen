    "intro": "Gentiana lavradioides, commonly known as the Alpine gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are tubular with five petals, and they attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
