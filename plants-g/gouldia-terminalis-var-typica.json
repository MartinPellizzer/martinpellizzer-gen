It features vibrant red, spurred flowers that resemble the foot of a kangaroo, blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, compact foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
