    "intro": "Goethea intermedia, commonly known as the common goethea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and features lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Goethea intermedia prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptability and role in supporting local pollinator populations."
