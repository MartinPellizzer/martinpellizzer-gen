    "intro": "Garnotia depressa, commonly known as the dwarf garnotia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and wildflower gardens."
