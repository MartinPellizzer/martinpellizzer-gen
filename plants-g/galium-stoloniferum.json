    "intro": "Galium stoloniferum, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically white or pink, clustered in umbels, and appear in late spring to early summer. Galium stoloniferum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
