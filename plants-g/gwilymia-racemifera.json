    "intro": "Gwilymia racemifera, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Gwilymia racemifera is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
