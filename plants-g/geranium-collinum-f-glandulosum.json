    "intro": "Geranium collinum f. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, glandular hairs, which give it its specific epithet. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats."
