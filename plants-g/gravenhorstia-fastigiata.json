    "intro": "Gravenhorstia fastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a dark green to blackish upper surface and a lighter, often whitish lower surface. The plant forms a dense, carpet-like growth on rocks, soil, or wood, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small organisms. It is characterized by its tightly packed, leaf-like structures and is often found in temperate regions. Gravenhorstia fastigiata plays a role in nutrient cycling and is an indicator species for certain environmental conditions."
