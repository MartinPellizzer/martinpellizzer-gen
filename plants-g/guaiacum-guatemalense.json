It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its thick, rough bark and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The tree is also valued for its wood, which has been historically used in the production of varnishes and dyes."
