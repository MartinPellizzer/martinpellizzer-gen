    "intro": "Glochidion kanalense, commonly known as the Kanal Island hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often ovate or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, showy flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or white, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Glochidion kanalense is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along riverbanks."
