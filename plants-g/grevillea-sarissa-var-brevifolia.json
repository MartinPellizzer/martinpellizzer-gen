    "intro": "Grevillea sarissa var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waratah, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, narrow leaves and striking, blood-red flower spikes that bloom in spring. The plant is part of the Proteaceae family, known for its showy inflorescences and adaptations to nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. The variety brevifolia is distinguished by its shorter, narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Grevillea sarissa."
