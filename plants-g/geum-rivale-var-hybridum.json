It features upright, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy coating that helps repel water. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near streams and ponds."
