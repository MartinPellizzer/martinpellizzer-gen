    "intro": "Garrya fremontii, commonly known as the fremont's silk tassel, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, pendulous clusters of small, white flowers that resemble tassels, which appear in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Garrya fremontii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscape design for its winter interest."
