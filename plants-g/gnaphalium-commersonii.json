    "intro": "Gnaphalium commersonii, commonly known as the Commerson's everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces achenes, which are dry, indehiscent fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its common name comes from its ability to retain its flowers for long periods, giving the appearance of being ever-lasting."
