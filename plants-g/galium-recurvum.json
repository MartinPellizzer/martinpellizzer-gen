    "intro": "Galium recurvum, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Galium recurvum is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in meadows."
