    "intro": "Golaea, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often grow on rocky substrates, showcasing adaptations to arid or semi-arid environments. The plants typically have pseudobulbs and linear leaves, with showy, often fragrant blooms in shades of white, yellow, and pink. Golaea species are native to regions in Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe, where they thrive in rocky or limestone soils. Due to their specific habitat requirements, many Golaea species are rare or endangered, making conservation efforts essential for their survival."
