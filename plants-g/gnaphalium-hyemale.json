    "intro": "Gnaphalium hyemale, commonly known as the winter everlasting, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense clusters of tiny, whitish to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic resin that gives it a strong, sometimes bitter scent. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture. Gnaphalium hyemale is often found in dry meadows, sandy soils, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun."
