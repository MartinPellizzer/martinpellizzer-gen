    "intro": "Goniopteris tuxtlensis, commonly known as the Tuxtl\u00e1n fern, is a species of tree fern native to southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant has a sturdy trunk that is covered in a mass of roots, which helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive arrangement of pinnae that give it a unique appearance. This fern thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forest understories where it plays a role in nutrient cycling and habitat provision."
