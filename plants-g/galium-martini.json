    "intro": "Galium martini, commonly known as creeping wood-sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Galium martini thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in temperate regions where it contributes to the undergrowth vegetation."
