    "intro": "Gilia latiflora subsp. purpusii, commonly known as the broadleaf gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of showy, bright pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as crevices and slopes, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
