    "intro": "Glechoma arvensis, commonly known as ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It has heart-shaped leaves with scalloped edges and produces small, purple or blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant spreads rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that can dominate moist, shaded areas. It is often considered a weed in gardens but is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to suppress erosion. Its medicinal properties have also been studied for their potential health benefits."
