    "intro": "Glycine simplicifolia, commonly known as the climbing bean or scarlet runner bean, is a leguminous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vigorous climbing habit and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers that give way to elongated pods containing edible seeds. Glycine simplicifolia has a complex root system that forms nodules with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. Its botanical features make it both a valuable agricultural crop and an ornamental plant in gardens."
