It is a member of the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers, and is characterized by its vibrant, coral-pink bracts that resemble flowers. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a valuable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
