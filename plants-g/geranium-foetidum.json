    "intro": "Geranium foetidum, commonly known as stinking geranium, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to red. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for garden settings. Its unique, somewhat unpleasant odor has earned it its common name, though it is appreciated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
