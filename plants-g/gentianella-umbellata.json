    "intro": "Gentianella umbellata, commonly known as the clustered gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its flowering stems are often branched and bear clusters of small, showy flowers. Gentianella umbellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators in its native environment."
