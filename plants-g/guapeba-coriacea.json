    "intro": "Guapeba coriacea, commonly known as the rough-skinned guapeba, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in a thick, leathery bark that gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are elliptical, with a rough texture and a dark green upper surface. Guapeba coriacea is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid climate of its native habitat."
