    "intro": "Gahnia fitzgeraldii, commonly known as Fitzgerald's tussock grass, is a perennial tussock-forming grass native to Australia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and swampy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has long, narrow leaves that form dense tussocks, and it produces spikes of small, spikelet-like flowers. It is well adapted to waterlogged conditions and plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Gahnia fitzgeraldii is also valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
