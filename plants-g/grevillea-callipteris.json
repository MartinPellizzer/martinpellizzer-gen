    "intro": "Grevillea callipteris, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically grey-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-shaped flowers in shades of red and orange, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Grevillea callipteris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscaping."
