    "intro": "Gluta beccarii, commonly known as the Bornean gluta, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a feature common in the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature, aiding in its dispersal. Gluta beccarii is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
