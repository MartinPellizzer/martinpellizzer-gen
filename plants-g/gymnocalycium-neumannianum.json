    "intro": "Gymnocalycium neumannianum, commonly known as the Neumann's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a thick, fleshy stem covered in a layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne on short, lateral branches. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance. Gymnocalycium neumannianum is also known for its ability to store water in its succulent stems, allowing it to thrive in arid environments."
