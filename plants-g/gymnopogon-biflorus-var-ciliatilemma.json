    "intro": "Gymnopogon biflorus var. ciliatilemma, commonly known as the fringed lemma grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing two flowers per spikelet, a feature that distinguishes it from other members of the genus. Its lemma, or bract, is notable for having fine cilia, or fringes, along the edges, giving it its specific epithet. It is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
