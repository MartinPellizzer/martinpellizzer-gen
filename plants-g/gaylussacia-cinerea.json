    "intro": "Gaylussacia cinerea, commonly known as the gray alder or sweet pepper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its grayish-green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of ecological systems in its native habitat."
