    "intro": "Gunnarella carinata, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed thistle, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green foliage and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a woody stem with distinctive longitudinal ridges, and its leaves are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats. Gunnarella carinata plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is considered a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
