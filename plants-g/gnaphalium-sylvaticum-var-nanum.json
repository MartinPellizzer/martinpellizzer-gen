    "intro": "Gnaphalium sylvaticum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf marsh thimbleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland and marshy areas in North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, clustered stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called cymes. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. This variety is distinguished by its smaller size compared to the typical form of Gnaphalium sylvaticum."
