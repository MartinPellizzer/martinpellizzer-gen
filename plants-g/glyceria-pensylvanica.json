    "intro": "Glyceria pensylvanica, commonly known as Pennsylvania glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers. Pennsylvania glyceria plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
