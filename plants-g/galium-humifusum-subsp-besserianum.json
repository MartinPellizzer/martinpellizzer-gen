It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, prostrate stems covered in fine hairs, and its small, white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly waxy texture. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in nutrient-poor soils."
