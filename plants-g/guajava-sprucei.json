    "intro": "Guajava sprucei, commonly known as the Mexican white pine, is a coniferous tree native to the highlands of central Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and long, soft needles that are typically light green in color. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and it is often found in well-drained, acidic soils. Guajava sprucei is valued for its timber and is also used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
