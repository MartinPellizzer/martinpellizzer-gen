    "intro": "Geranium anemonoides, commonly known as the meadow geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems with palmate leaves that are often hairy and have a lobed appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Geranium anemonoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
