    "intro": "Grumilea achtenii, commonly known as the Achten's grumilea, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. It produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Grumilea achtenii is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
