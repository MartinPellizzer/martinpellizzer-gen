It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered with fine, stiff hairs. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that matures in late summer, releasing tiny seeds."
