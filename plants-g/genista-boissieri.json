    "intro": "Genista boissieri, commonly known as the Boissier's broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, woody stems covered in fine, wiry hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and needle-like, arranged in pairs along the stems, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Genista boissieri is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
