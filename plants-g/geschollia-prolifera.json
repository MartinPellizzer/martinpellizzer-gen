    "intro": "Geschollia prolifera, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming dense mats that help stabilize the soil in its wetland environment. Geschollia prolifera is an important component of biodiversity in its native ecosystems and is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants."
