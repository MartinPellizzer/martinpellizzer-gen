    "intro": "Goniopteris cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a member of the water fern family, Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinct central axis and closely spaced pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and swampy areas. Its leaves are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking feature in its natural habitat. Goniopteris cuneata plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
