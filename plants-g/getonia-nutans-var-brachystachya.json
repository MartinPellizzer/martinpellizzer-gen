    "intro": "Getonia nutans var. brachystachya, commonly known as the short-stalked broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses or other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its stems are often slender and branched. It is found in various regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and nutrient cycling."
