    "intro": "Gomphogyne macrocarpa, commonly known as the African giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic life. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in shallow waters and absorbing nutrients from the water. Gomphogyne macrocarpa plays an important ecological role in its native wetlands by stabilizing water surfaces and supporting biodiversity."
