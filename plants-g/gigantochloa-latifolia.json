It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant is known for its robust growth and is often used in landscaping and as a source of biomass. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly and form dense clumps. It thrives in tropical climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
