    "intro": "Geophila erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited mountain grass, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountain slopes. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its distinctive red, fleshy fruits are an adaptation for seed dispersal by animals. Geophila erythrocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional medicinal uses in its native regions."
