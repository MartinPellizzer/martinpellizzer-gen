    "intro": "Gypsophila ruscifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf gypsophila, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant often grows in rocky or gravelly soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden arrangements and as a cut flower. This variety is more robust than the typical form, making it suitable for a wider range of growing conditions."
