    "intro": "Ginginsia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale, translucent leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and accumulated debris. Ginginsia thrives in high humidity and shade, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and its rarity, it is considered endangered in many regions."
