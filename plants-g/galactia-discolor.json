    "intro": "Galactia discolor, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces cylindrical pods containing several seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in arid environments. Galactia discolor is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy plant in dry climates. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
