    "intro": "Globba lancangensis, commonly known as the Lancang globba, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, commonly known as the ginger family, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are broad, sword-shaped, and covered with a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Globba lancangensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
