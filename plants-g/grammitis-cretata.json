    "intro": "Grammitis cretata, commonly known as the Cretaceous fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis cretata plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
