    "intro": "Gnidia fraterna, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Gnidia fraterna is also noted for its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils and its role in supporting local wildlife."
