It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by small, dry fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
