    "intro": "Guatteria inuncta var. minor, commonly known as the small-flowered guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Annonaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in areas with humid, shaded understories of forests. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains several seeds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
