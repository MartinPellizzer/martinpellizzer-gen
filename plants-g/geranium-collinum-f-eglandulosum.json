    "intro": "Geranium collinum f. eglandulosum, commonly known as the glandless mountain geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features upright stems that are often branched and covered with opposite, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is distinguished by its lack of glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, giving it a smooth texture compared to other geranium species."
