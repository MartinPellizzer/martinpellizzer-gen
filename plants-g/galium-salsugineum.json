    "intro": "Galium salsugineum, commonly known as sea spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, bladder-like fruits. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
