    "intro": "Gunnera perpensa var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf giant dock, is a striking perennial plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1.5 meters in diameter, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, fuzzy underside. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by distinctive, spiky seed heads. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its dramatic foliage. Due to its size and visual impact, it is best suited for large garden spaces or as a focal point in landscape design."
