It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically features serrated, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.
