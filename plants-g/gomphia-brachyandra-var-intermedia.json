It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid regions. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies in its native habitat."
