    "intro": "Grammitis obscura, commonly known as the dark grammitis, is a fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis obscura is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
