    "intro": "Gonolobus ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Ecuador. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, often yellow or orange flowers. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It is adapted to grow in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed or arid habitats. Gonolobus ecuadorensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insects."
