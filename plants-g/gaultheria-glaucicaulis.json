    "intro": "Gaultheria glaucicaulis, commonly known as the alpine wintergreen, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a waxy, whitish coating. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible and have a tart, aromatic flavor. Gaultheria glaucicaulis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its foliage and berries are used in traditional medicine and as a source of flavoring in various products."
