    "intro": "Gaillonia hymenostephana, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive star-shaped pattern on the petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The orchid thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
