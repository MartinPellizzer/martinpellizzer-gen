    "intro": "Ginkgo biloba f. aurea, commonly known as the golden ginkgo, is a unique cultivar of the ginkgo tree characterized by its striking golden-yellow leaves. This variety exhibits a more pronounced and earlier leaf color change compared to the standard ginkgo, making it a popular ornamental tree. The leaves are fan-shaped, with a distinct bifurcated vein pattern, and they turn a brilliant yellow in autumn. It is a deciduous tree that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often used in urban landscapes for its aesthetic value. The plant is also noted for its tolerance to pollution and urban conditions, making it a resilient choice for city environments."
