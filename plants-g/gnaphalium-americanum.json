    "intro": "Gnaphalium americanum, commonly known as common cudweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Gnaphalium americanum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects."
