    "intro": "Glyceria arctica, commonly known as Arctic glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in cold, moist environments such as tundra and wet meadows, demonstrating remarkable adaptability to harsh climatic conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Glyceria arctica plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various Arctic flora and fauna."
