    "intro": "Gravesia marojejyensis, commonly known as the Marojejy gravesia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Marojejy Mountains in northeastern Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive red calyx. The plant is adapted to the humid, misty conditions of its high-altitude habitat, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status remains poorly understood."
