    "intro": "Glyceria saltensis, commonly known as salt marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal and brackish wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to tolerate high salinity levels. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Glyceria saltensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wetland organisms. Its ability to thrive in saline conditions makes it a key component of salt marsh ecosystems."
