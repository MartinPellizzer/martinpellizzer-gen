    "intro": "Gossypium peruvianum subsp. racemosum, commonly known as the Peruvian cotton, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, green flowers that develop into fluffy, seed-filled bolls, typical of the cotton genus. Its fibrous seeds are valued for their high-quality cotton fibers, which are used in textile production. This subspecies is also noted for its adaptability to high-altitude conditions and its role in traditional Andean agriculture."
