    "intro": "Gentianella glenniae, commonly known as the Glenn's gentian, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is a member of the Gentianaceae family, characterized by its showy blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, thriving in coastal climates. It produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
