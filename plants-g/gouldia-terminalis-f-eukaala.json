    "intro": "Gouldia terminalis f. eukaala, commonly known as the Eukaala everlasting, is a striking ornamental plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the Goodeniaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant forms dense, compact clumps with grass-like foliage, and its flowers are borne in terminal clusters. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its salt and wind tolerance. The cultivar 'Eukaala' is particularly noted for its showy, semi-evergreen blooms that persist through much of the year."
