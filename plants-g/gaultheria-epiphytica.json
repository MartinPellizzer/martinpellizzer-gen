    "intro": "Gaultheria epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic wintergreen, is a species of shrub native to the temperate rainforests of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants, typically trees, without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are rich in aromatic oils, similar to those found in other wintergreen species. Its leaves are evergreen, glossy, and often have a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Gaultheria epiphytica is valued both for its ecological role in forest ecosystems and for its potential medicinal uses."
