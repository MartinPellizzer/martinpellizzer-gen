    "intro": "Gagea belgica, commonly known as the Belgian spring beauty, is a perennial bulbous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
