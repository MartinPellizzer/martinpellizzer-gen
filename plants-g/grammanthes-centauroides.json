    "intro": "Grammanthes centauroides, commonly known as the centaur's crown, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, spiky leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a water-holding cup at the center. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in the axils of the leaves, adding a dramatic visual contrast. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. Grammanthes centauroides thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens."
