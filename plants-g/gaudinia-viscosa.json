    "intro": "Gaudinia viscosa, commonly known as the sticky gaudinia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, characterized by its woody stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are often covered in a sticky resin, which gives it its common name and provides some natural defense against herbivores. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
