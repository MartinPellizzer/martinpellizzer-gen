    "intro": "Gaultheria pumila var. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, white, waxy berries in the fall. These berries are aromatic and have a sharp, peppery flavor, making them popular in culinary and medicinal uses. The leaves are dark green and glossy, providing dense foliage that supports a variety of wildlife."
