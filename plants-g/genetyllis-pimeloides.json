    "intro": "Genetyllis pimeloides, commonly known as the small-flowered sandbur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a small annual herb with a compact, prostrate growth habit, often forming dense mats on sandy soils. The plant produces tiny, spiny fruits called burrs, which are adapted for wind and animal dispersal. Its narrow leaves are hairy and adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Genetyllis pimeloides is often found in coastal dunes and inland sandy plains, contributing to the ecological stability of these habitats."
