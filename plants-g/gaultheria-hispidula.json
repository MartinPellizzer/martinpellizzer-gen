    "intro": "Gaultheria hispidula, commonly known as the hairy wintergreen, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, evergreen leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, peppery flavor, often used in traditional medicine. Gaultheria hispidula thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests."
