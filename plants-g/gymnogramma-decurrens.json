    "intro": "Gymnogramma decurrens, commonly known as the creeping maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are often described as lace-like in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats. Gymnogramma decurrens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
