    "intro": "Gymnopogon mollis, commonly known as the soft grass or velvet grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, hairy spikelets. Gymnopogon mollis is often found in meadows, along streambanks, and in disturbed areas, contributing to soil stabilization and ecological diversity."
