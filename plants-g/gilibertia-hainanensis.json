It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, berry-like fruits. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
