    "intro": "Gymnadenia nigra subsp. delphineae, commonly known as the Delphinean grasspinks, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-brown seed pods that disperse its seeds. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered in many regions."
