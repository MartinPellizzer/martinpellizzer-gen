    "intro": "Goniothalamus roseus, commonly known as the rosewood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and aromatic wood. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to its valuable timber, Goniothalamus roseus is also considered an endangered species in many regions."
