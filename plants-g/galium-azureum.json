It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that produce small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Galium azureum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil in wet areas."
