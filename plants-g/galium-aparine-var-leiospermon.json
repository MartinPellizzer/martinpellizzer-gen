    "intro": "Galium aparine var. leiospermon, commonly known as sticky willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, sticky hairs. It features small, white to pale green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a slightly hairy surface. This variant is distinguished by its smooth, less hairy seeds compared to other varieties of Galium aparine. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges."
