    "intro": "Gilia gayana, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Gilia gayana is often found in disturbed soils and can serve as a valuable nectar source for pollinators."
