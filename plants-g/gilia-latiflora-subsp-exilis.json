    "intro": "Gilia latiflora subsp. exilis, commonly known as the narrowleaf gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
