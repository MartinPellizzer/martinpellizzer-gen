    "intro": "Genista germanica var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are alternate, simple, and trifoliate, with a leathery texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for dry, rocky habitats. This variety lacks the thorns found in other genista species, hence its common name."
