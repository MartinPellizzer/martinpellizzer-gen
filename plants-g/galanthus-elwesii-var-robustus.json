    "intro": "Galanthus elwesii var. robustus, commonly known as the robust snowdrop, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It produces clusters of delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. It thrives in well-drained, humus-rich soil and partial shade. This variety is prized for its hardiness and ability to naturalize over time."
