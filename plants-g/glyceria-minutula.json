    "intro": "Glyceria minutula, commonly known as the narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland areas. Glyceria minutula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich environments."
