    "intro": "Galinsoga caligensis, commonly known as the \"Mexican horseweed,\" is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is an annual herb that grows up to 60 centimeters tall, featuring slender stems and hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its seeds are enclosed in small, spiky capsules that disperse easily, aiding in its spread. Galinsoga caligensis is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
