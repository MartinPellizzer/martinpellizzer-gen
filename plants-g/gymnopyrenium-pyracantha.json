    "intro": "Gymnopyrenium pyracantha, commonly known as the pyracantha rose, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, orange-yellow flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are edible but have a tart flavor. Gymnopyrenium pyracantha thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental gardens. Its hardy nature and seasonal display of flowers and fruits make it a notable addition to botanical collections."
