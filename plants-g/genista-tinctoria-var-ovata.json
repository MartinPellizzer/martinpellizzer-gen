It is characterized by its dense, spiny growth habit and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, dark blue berries. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in dye production, it has been cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
