    "intro": "Goeppertia bicolor, commonly known as the Zebra Cactus, is a striking member of the Zingiberaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its vibrant, striped leaves that resemble a zebra's pattern. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. Its foliage is thick and waxy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. Goeppertia bicolor is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
