    "intro": "Glochidion mitrastylum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed glabrous wood, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glossy and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments within forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
