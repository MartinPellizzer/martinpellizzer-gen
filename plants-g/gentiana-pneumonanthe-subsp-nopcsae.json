It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are erect and bear the showy flowers.
