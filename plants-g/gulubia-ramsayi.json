    "intro": "Gulubia ramsayi, commonly known as the Ramsay's gulubia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are ovate and slightly hairy, while its flowers bloom during the rainy season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Gulubia ramsayi is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
