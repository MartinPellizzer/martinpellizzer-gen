    "intro": "Genista aetnensis subsp. fraisseorum, commonly known as the Aetna broom, is a shrub native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment of its habitat. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and arranged in pairs along the stems. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
