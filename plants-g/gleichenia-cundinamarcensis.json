    "intro": "Gleichenia cundinamarcensis, commonly known as the Cundinamarca fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green and covered in fine, silky hairs. Native to the Andean region of Colombia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
