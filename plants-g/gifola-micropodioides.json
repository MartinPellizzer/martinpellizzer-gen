    "intro": "Gifola micropodioides, commonly known as the small-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
