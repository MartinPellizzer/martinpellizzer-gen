    "intro": "Gentiana rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Gentiana rigidifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
