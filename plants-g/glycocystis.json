    "intro": "Glycocystis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, lantern-like flowers that resemble small, glowing orbs. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white blooms that are often fragrant, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Glycocystis species are typically shrubs or small trees, with thick, fleshy stems and broad, palmate leaves. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their striking, otherworldly appearance."
