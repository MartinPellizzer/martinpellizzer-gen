    "intro": "Glyceria depauperata var. infirma, commonly known as the slender watergrass, is a flowering plant species native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond margins, and along streams. Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms, it plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
