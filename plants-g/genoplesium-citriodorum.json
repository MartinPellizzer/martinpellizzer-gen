    "intro": "Genoplesium citriodorum, commonly known as the lemon-scented piper, is an epiphytic orchid native to southeastern Australia. It produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that resemble those of the genus *Piper*, hence its common name. The plant has linear, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic substrates. The species is noted for its distinctive citrus-like aroma, which is particularly noticeable when the leaves are crushed."
