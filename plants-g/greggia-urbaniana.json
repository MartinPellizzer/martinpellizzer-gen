    "intro": "Greggia urbaniana, commonly known as the Urbanian greggia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely arranged around the stems. Greggia urbaniana thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
