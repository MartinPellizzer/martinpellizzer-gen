    "intro": "Gasteria formosa, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy coating, arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, usually in shades of yellow or orange. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Gasteria formosa is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
