It is characterized by its pale yellow flowers with white tepals, which bloom early in the spring. This variety is native to the British Isles and is often found in woodland and grassland habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single flower per stem. Due to its rarity, it is considered a valuable species in botanical collections and conservation efforts."
