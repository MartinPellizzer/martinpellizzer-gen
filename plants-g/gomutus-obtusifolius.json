    "intro": "Gomutus obtusifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved gomutus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
