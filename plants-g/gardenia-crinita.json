It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and its striking, waxy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gardenia crinita is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and unique foliage."
