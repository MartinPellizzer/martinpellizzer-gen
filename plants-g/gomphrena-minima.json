    "intro": "Gomphrena minima, commonly known as the dwarf garden globe flower, is a compact, herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its small, globe-shaped, bract-like flowers that range in color from pink to red and purple. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 cm, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a bedding plant. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are somewhat succulent in texture. Gomphrena minima thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and it is often used in dried floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms."
