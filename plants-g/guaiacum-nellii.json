    "intro": "Guaiacum nellii, commonly known as the Bahamian guaiacum, is a rare shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly the Bahamas. It is a member of the Zygophyllaceae family and is characterized by its woody, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to coastal and sandy environments, often growing in dry, well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Guaiacum nellii is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
