    "intro": "Grastidium tozerense, commonly known as the Tozer's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the humid forests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, pale green fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions in the undergrowth. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a unique ability to retain water in its rhizomes, allowing it to survive in seasonal dry periods. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Grastidium tozerense is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and conservation."
