    "intro": "Gymnocalycium gibbosum, commonly known as the globular cactus or the rock cactus, is a species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Gymnocalycium gibbosum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
