    "intro": "Galactia rudolphioides var. haitiensis, commonly known as Haitian milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly Haiti. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds with tufts of white hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It is known for its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation, and is often found in dry, disturbed habitats. This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various insects and small animals."
