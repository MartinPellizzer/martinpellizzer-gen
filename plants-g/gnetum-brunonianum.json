    "intro": "Gnetum brunonianum, commonly known as the Bornean gnetum, is a gymnosperm native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring scale-like leaves and a distinctive branching pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female structures. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, berry-like structure, which is an unusual trait among gymnosperms. This species plays a role in its ecosystem as both a food source and a habitat for various organisms."
