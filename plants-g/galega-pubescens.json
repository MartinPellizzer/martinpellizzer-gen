    "intro": "Galega pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent goat's rue, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in soft, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and also covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Galega pubescens is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates."
