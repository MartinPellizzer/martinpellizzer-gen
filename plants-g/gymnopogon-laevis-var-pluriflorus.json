    "intro": "Gymnopogon laevis var. pluriflorus, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass variant with multiple flowers, is a grass species characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets. Its flowering structure is adapted for wind pollination, a common trait among grasses. This variant is notable for its variability in flower density, which may influence its ecological role and reproductive success."
