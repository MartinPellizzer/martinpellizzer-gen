    "intro": "Gynema dentata, commonly known as the \"spleenwort\" or \"Indian nettle,\" is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of Asia. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Gynema dentata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though scientific validation remains limited."
