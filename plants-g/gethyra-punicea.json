    "intro": "Gethyra punicea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown bark and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested or coastal areas. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
