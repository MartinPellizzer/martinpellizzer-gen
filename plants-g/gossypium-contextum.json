    "intro": "Gossypium contextum, commonly known as the desert cotton, is a shrub native to arid regions of North America. It produces small, fluffy seeds encased in a fibrous capsule, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. The plant has hairy, branching stems and small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its fibers are less commercially valuable than those of other cotton species but are used in traditional textile practices. Gossypium contextum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
