    "intro": "Gibbaeum hortenseae, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, tubular leaves that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in spring. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to succulent collections."
