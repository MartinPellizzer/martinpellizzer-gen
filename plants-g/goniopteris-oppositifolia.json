It is characterized by its large, fronds that are typically bipinnate, with pinnae arranged oppositely along the rachis. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns.
