    "intro": "Geranium ibericum var. album, commonly known as the white geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
