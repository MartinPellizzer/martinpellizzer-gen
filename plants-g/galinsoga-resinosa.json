    "intro": "Galinsoga resinosa, commonly known as sticky weed or galinsoga, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are covered in fine, glandular trichomes that produce a sticky resin. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its fruit is a narrow, elongated achene that is often covered in the same sticky substance. Galinsoga resinosa is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings."
