It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers with distinctive yellow spots. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs, while its stems are usually unbranched and somewhat woody at the base. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies with their vibrant colors and nectar."
