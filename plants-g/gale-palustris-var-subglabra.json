    "intro": "Gale palustris var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth marsh gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, often with a reddish tinge. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are clustered in terminal racemes. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a waxy texture. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless foliage, which sets it apart from other gentian species."
