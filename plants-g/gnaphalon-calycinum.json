    "intro": "Gnaphalon calycinum, commonly known as the woolly dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of soft, hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces a single, yellow flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are followed by a distinctive, inflated, seed-filled capsule that aids in wind dispersal. The species is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, showcasing its resilience in harsh environments."
