    "intro": "Galium petrosum, commonly known as creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veined pattern and produces delicate white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems spread along the ground, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Galium petrosum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to tolerate poor nutrient conditions."
