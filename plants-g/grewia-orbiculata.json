    "intro": "Grewia orbiculata, commonly known as the roundleaf bushwillow, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and oval, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Grewia orbiculata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
