    "intro": "Guamatela tuerckheimii, commonly known as the Guatemalan orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the highlands of Guatemala. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually, forming dense clumps over time. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
