    "intro": "Grewia mesopoda, commonly known as the sour fig or wild sour fig, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and clusters of small, red berries that turn orange when ripe. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry, rocky soils. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The fruit is edible but has a tart flavor, making it a valuable food source for both wildlife and humans."
