    "intro": "Galium setaceum f. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf wood sorrel, is a variant of the wood sorrel species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are broader than the typical form of the species. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal remedies, though it is not widely cultivated for ornamental purposes."
