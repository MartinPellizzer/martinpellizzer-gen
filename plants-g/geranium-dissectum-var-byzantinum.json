    "intro": "Geranium dissectum var. byzantinum, commonly known as Byzantine geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features upright stems with lance-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
