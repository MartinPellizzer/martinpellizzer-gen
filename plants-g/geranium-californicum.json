It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom from spring to summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes. Its foliage and flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value."
