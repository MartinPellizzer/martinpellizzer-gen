It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, typically greenish-white in color. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release flat, winged seeds."
