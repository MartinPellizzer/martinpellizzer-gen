    "intro": "Gentiana utriculosa f. montenegrina, commonly known as the Montenegro gentian, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its deep blue, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and alpine meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often hairy as well. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
