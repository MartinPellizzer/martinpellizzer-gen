    "intro": "Garcinia acuminata, commonly known as the African mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western and central Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers, followed by round, segmented fruits that are typically a deep purple or red when ripe. The fruit's pericarp contains a juicy, acidic pulp surrounded by a white, fibrous layer. Garcinia acuminata is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in local medicine."
