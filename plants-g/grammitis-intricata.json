    "intro": "Grammitis intricata, commonly known as the intricate fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, intricately veined leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, clustered fronds are adapted for moisture retention and efficient photosynthesis in low-light conditions. Grammitis intricata plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing microhabitats for various small organisms."
