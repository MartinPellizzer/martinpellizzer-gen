    "intro": "Grammitis subtilis, commonly known as the slender grammitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Grammitis subtilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
