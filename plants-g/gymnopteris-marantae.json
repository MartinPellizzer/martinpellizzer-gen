    "intro": "Gymnopteris marantae, commonly known as the Marantae holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Gymnopteris marantae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
