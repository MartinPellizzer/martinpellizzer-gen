    "intro": "Grammitis obtusata, commonly known as the blunt-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The fronds are usually short and broad, with a leathery texture and a bluish-green coloration. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and often grows on trees or rocks. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
