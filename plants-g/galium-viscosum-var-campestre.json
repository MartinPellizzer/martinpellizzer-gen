    "intro": "Galium viscosum var. campestre, commonly known as sticky willowherb, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems covered in sticky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its sticky texture. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks."
