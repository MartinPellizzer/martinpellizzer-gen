    "intro": "Gymnogramma davallioides, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are wiry and form a dense network, helping to anchor it to substrates. Gymnogramma davallioides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
