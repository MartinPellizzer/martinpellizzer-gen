    "intro": "Gaultheria smithii, commonly known as the dwarf strawberry bush, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to western North America. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and emit a slight fragrance. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in late summer. These berries are edible and have a tart, slightly sweet flavor, often used in culinary applications. Gaultheria smithii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
