    "intro": "Genista pumila subsp. elias-sennenii, commonly known as the Elias-Sennen's dwarf broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typical of the Genista genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in suitable climates."
