    "intro": "Garcinia gummi-gutta var. gummi-gutta, commonly known as the gutta-percha tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree's most notable feature is its latex-rich sap, which is used to make gutta-percha, a natural rubber-like material. The fruit is small, round, and typically turns red when ripe, containing a single seed. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests."
