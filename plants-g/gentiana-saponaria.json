    "intro": "Gentiana saponaria, commonly known as the soaproot gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating. Its root system is notable for containing saponins, which give it its common name. Gentiana saponaria is often found in shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in herbal medicine."
