    "intro": "Girardinia diversifolia subsp. triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed pittosporum, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are distinctly three-lobed, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. These flowers are followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats."
