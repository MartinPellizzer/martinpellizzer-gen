    "intro": "Galeorchis doyonensis, commonly known as the Doyon's galeorchis, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip that is characteristic of the orchid family. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
