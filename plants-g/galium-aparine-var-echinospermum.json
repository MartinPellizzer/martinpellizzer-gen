    "intro": "Galium aparine var. echinospermum, commonly known as hairy cranesbill, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its common name. Its fruit is a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases tiny seeds with hooked bristles, aiding in seed dispersal. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
