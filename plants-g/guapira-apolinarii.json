    "intro": "Guapira apolinarii, commonly known as the Brazilian ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
