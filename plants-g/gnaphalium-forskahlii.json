    "intro": "Gnaphalium forskahlii, commonly known as the Kashmir chrysanthemum, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in northern India and Pakistan. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with numerous small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Gnaphalium forskahlii is also noted for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
