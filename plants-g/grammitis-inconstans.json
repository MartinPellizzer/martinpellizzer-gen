    "intro": "Grammitis inconstans, commonly known as the variable hound's-tongue, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for dispersal. Grammitis inconstans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
