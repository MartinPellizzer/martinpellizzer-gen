    "intro": "Geonoma maxima subsp. chelidonura, commonly known as the Chelidonura fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
