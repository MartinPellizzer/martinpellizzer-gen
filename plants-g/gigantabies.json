    "intro": "Gigantabies, commonly known as giant lily of the valley, are herbaceous plants native to the mountainous regions of South America. They are characterized by their striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. Gigantabies thrive in cool, moist environments and are often found in forest understories. Their bulbs are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution due to their toxic properties."
