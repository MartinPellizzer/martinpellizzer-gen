    "intro": "Galium exsurgens, commonly known as the ascending bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. Galium exsurgens thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
