    "intro": "Geraniospermum oenotherae, commonly known as the desert geranium, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water. Its flowers bloom in the morning and close in the afternoon, a trait that helps reduce water loss. The species is well-suited to xerophytic environments and is often found in rocky soils."
