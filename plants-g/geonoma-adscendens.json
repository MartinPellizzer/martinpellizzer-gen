    "intro": "Geonoma adscendens, commonly known as the ascending geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that grow in a compact, clustered form. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
