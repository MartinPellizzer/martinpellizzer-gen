    "intro": "Gleichenella pectinata, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to Australia and New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery fronds that are covered in a silvery, waxy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Gleichenella pectinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological systems of its native habitats."
