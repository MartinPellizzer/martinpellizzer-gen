    "intro": "Garcinia terpnophylla, commonly known as the Malabar tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody pods containing bitter, yellow-orange seeds. The fruit is often used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties. Garcinia terpnophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and unique fruiting habit."
