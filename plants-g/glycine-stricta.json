    "intro": "Glycine stricta, commonly known as the slender climbing bean, is a leguminous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Glycine stricta is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal use."
