    "intro": "Gentiana bodinieri, commonly known as the Bodinier gentian, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its deep blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. The genus Gentiana is known for its showy, often blue or purple flowers, and G. bodinieri is no exception, making it a prized addition to botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
