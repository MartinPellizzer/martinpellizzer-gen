    "intro": "Galium ferrugineum, commonly known as rusty bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered with fine, rusty-colored hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Galium ferrugineum is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
