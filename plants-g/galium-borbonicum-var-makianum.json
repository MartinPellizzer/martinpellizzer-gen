    "intro": "Galium borbonicum var. makianum, commonly known as the Makian bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the island of Makian in Indonesia. It is a low-growing herb with slender stems that often lie prostrate on the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are opposite and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its tropical environment."
