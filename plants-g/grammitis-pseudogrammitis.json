    "intro": "Grammitis pseudogrammitis, commonly known as the false sword fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous structure with dark green, lanceolate fronds that are often divided into smaller, serrated segments. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis pseudogrammitis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush, dense foliage."
