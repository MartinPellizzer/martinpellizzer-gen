    "intro": "Goodyera gibbsiae, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and exquisite terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its striking, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in the understory of forests. Its unique morphology includes aerial roots that help it absorb nutrients from the air. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Goodyera gibbsiae is listed as an endangered species."
