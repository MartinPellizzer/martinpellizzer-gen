    "intro": "Gethyum atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems covered in dense, purple-tinged hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often covered in fine spines, providing a defensive mechanism against herbivores. The plant is adapted to poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
