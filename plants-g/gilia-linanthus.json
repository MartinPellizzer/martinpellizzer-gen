    "intro": "Gilia linanthus, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Gilia linanthus plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
