    "intro": "Grammitis polytricha, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis polytricha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
