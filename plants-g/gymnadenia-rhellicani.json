    "intro": "Gymnadenia rhellicani, commonly known as the RHELICANI grasspocket orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths, often in nutrient-poor soils. It has a slender, grass-like appearance with a single stem and is known for its delicate, ephemeral blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
