    "intro": "Galium setaceum var. genuinum, commonly known as the slender bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, branched stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in umbels. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its slightly more robust growth compared to other Galium species."
