    "intro": "Galeopsis conillii, commonly known as narrow-leaved hedge-nettle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Galeopsis conillii typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is an herbaceous perennial that plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
