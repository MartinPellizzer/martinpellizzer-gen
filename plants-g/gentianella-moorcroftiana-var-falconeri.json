    "intro": "Gentianella moorcroftiana var. falconeri, commonly known as the Falconeri's gentian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a slender, upright stem with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
