    "intro": "Gnaphalium leiopodium, commonly known as silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, silvery-gray, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gnaphalium leiopodium is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun and dry conditions."
