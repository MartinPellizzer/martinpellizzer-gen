    "intro": "Galium palustre var. elongatum, commonly known as long-stemmed bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its herbaceous nature and preference for moist soils make it a common sight in swampy areas and along the edges of ponds. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
