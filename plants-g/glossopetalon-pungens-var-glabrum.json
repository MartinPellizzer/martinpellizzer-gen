    "intro": "Glossopetalon pungens var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth glossopetalon, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pungent-smelling leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has smooth, glabrous foliage, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Glossopetalon. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
