    "intro": "Galactia speciosa, commonly known as the showy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as desert scrub and chaparral. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces showy, pink to purple pea-like flowers. Its seed pods are slender and contain several kidney-shaped seeds. Galactia speciosa plays a role in local ecosystems by providing forage for wildlife and contributing to soil nitrogen through its legume characteristics."
