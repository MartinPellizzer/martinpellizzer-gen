    "intro": "Guettarda rigida var. rigida, commonly known as the coastal guettarda, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant thrives in coastal areas, tolerating saline and wind-swept conditions, making it a hardy species for coastal landscaping. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, while its roots help stabilize sandy soils. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to prevent erosion along shorelines."
