    "intro": "Garcinia mannii var. brevipedicellata, commonly known as the short-stalked Garcinia, is a tropical shrub native to western Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces yellow-orange berries that contain a high concentration of hydroxycitric acid, which has attracted interest for its potential health benefits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. The varietal distinction is based on the shorter pedicels compared to the typical form of Garcinia mannii."
