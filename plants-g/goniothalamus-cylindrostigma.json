    "intro": "Goniothalamus cylindrostigma, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed goniothalamus, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stem and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are berry-like, often containing multiple seeds, and it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its family."
