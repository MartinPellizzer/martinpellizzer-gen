    "intro": "Gasteria subverrucosa var. marginata, commonly known as the Zulu candleplant, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves with distinctive white or pale margins. The leaves are adorned with small, raised bumps and are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It produces clusters of bright yellow flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
