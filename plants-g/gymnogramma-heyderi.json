    "intro": "Gymnogramma heyderi, commonly known as the Heyder's kidney fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that resemble the shape of a kidney. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in high humidity. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Gymnogramma heyderi is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
