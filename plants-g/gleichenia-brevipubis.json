    "intro": "Gleichenia brevipubis, commonly known as the short-hair fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, round clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Gleichenia brevipubis is a cryptogamic plant that plays a role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitats."
