    "intro": "Gastrochilus suavis, commonly known as the sweet gastrochilus, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The orchid is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its role in local ecosystems and traditional medicine."
