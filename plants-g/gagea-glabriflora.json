    "intro": "Gagea glabriflora, commonly known as the smooth-flowered gagea, is a small, bulbous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or open woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in arid conditions, allowing it to endure periods of drought. Gagea glabriflora is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it blooms in early spring."
