    "intro": "Gynandropsis tracyi, commonly known as the Tracy's gynandropsis, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub or perennial herb, with narrow, linear leaves adapted to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Gynandropsis tracyi is well-suited to harsh environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
