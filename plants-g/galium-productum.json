    "intro": "Galium productum, commonly known as creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant has small, opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically borne on slender pedicels and are often clustered in groups of three. Galium productum is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
