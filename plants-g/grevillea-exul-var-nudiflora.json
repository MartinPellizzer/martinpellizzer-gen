    "intro": "Grevillea exul var. nudiflora, commonly known as the naked-flowered grevillea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red or orange flowers that are typically naked, meaning they lack the showy bracts seen in other grevillea species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for dry gardens. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for landscaping in arid regions."
