    "intro": "Ganua, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and elusive plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear only under specific environmental conditions. The plant's botanical name, *Ganua*, is derived from the indigenous Quechua language, reflecting its cultural significance. Its unique morphology includes a short, hairy stem and small, inconspicuous leaves. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a highly specialized species with limited distribution."
