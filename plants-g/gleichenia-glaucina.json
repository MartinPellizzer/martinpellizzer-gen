    "intro": "Gleichenia glaucina, commonly known as the bluish Gleichenia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizome and the presence of two types of leaves: the sterile, elongated fronds and the fertile, shorter spore-bearing fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are covered with a fine, waxy coating that gives them a bluish hue, which helps reduce water loss. Gleichenia glaucina is widely distributed across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
