    "intro": "Gastrochilus holttumianus, commonly known as the holttumian orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, where it derives moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale pink, arranged in clusters along the stem. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and anchoring it to its host. Gastrochilus holttumianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
