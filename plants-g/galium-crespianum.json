    "intro": "Galium crespianum, commonly known as creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Galium crespianum thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
