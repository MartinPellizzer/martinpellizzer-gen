    "intro": "Gordonia hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan torreya, is a rare evergreen tree native to the Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the family Torreziaceae and is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by dark blue, fleshy fruits. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens due to its unique appearance and limited natural distribution. However, it faces threats from habitat loss and is considered vulnerable in its native range."
