    "intro": "Geraniospermum viscosissimum, commonly known as the sticky geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that exude a sticky substance, which helps deter herbivores. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and adaptations, it is often cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
