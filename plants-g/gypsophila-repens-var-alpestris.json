    "intro": "Gypsophila repens var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine baby's breath, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, lace-like flowers that bloom in clusters of white, pink, or pale blue, often resembling a cloud or mist. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat, helping to stabilize soil in rocky environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and its ability to flourish in challenging, high-altitude conditions."
