    "intro": "Gagea chabertii var. foliosa, commonly known as the broad-leaved gagea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers during late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
