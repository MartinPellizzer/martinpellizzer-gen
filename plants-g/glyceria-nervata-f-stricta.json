    "intro": "Glyceria nervata f. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct midrib and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer. Glyceria nervata f. stricta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
