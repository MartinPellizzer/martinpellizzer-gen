    "intro": "Goniolimon desertorum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy stems adapted to store water. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Goniolimon desertorum is well-suited to harsh desert environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
