    "intro": "Glossochilus, commonly known as the tongue orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, often showy flowers that feature a prominent, lip-like structure resembling a tongue. They are predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where they thrive in humid, shaded environments. Glossochilus species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks for support. Their botanical significance lies in their ornamental value and their role in the ecological diversity of their native habitats."
