    "intro": "Galactia belizensis, commonly known as the Belize milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Belize. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in racemes, and its leaves are typically trifoliate. Galactia belizensis is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed or open habitats. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
