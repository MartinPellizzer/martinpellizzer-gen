It is characterized by its large, colorful inflorescence that resembles a torch, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and insects. Its flowers bloom in a spiral arrangement, adding to its dramatic visual appeal. Guzmania megastachya thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
