    "intro": "Gymnadenia \u00d7 intermedia subsp. proxima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved goat's-rue, is a hybrid orchid species native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and woodland edges, preferring partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, elongated, cylindrical flower spike. This subspecies is notable for its intermediate features between its parent species, Gymnadenia conopsea and Gymnadenia \u00d7 intermedia."
