    "intro": "Goodyera schlechtendaliana, commonly known as the silver waffleplant, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its striking, waxy, dark green leaves with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often hidden beneath the foliage. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique leaf structure and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for shade gardens."
