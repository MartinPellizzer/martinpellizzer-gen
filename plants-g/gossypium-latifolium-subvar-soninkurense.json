It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and produces fluffy, white fibers similar to those of cultivated cotton. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to harsh conditions. Its fibers are not commonly harvested for commercial use but are of interest in botanical studies. The species plays a role in local ecosystems and may have potential for future agricultural or ecological applications."
