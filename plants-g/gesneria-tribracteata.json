    "intro": "Gesneria tribracteata, commonly known as the velvetleaf gesneria, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with contrasting yellow or white markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria tribracteata is popular among collectors for its ornamental value and ease of care in a home environment."
