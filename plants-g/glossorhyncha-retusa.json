    "intro": "Glossorhyncha retusa, commonly known as the slender-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy berries. The plant's root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients."
