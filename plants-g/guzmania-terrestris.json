    "intro": "Guzmania terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial bromeliad, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup. The plant's foliage is typically green to blue-green, with some varieties displaying striking red or purple hues along the leaf margins. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Guzmania terrestris is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
