    "intro": "Globularia pungens, commonly known as the prickly globe-thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spherical, spiny seed heads and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with stiff, bristly hairs. Globularia pungens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
