    "intro": "Guzmania clavata, commonly known as the flame plant, is a tropical bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored inflorescence that resembles a flame, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool that supports small aquatic life. Its foliage is typically green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Guzmania clavata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
