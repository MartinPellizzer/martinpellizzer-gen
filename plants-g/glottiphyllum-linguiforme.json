    "intro": "Glottiphyllum linguiforme, commonly known as the tongue-shaped lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive leaf-like morphology. It typically grows on soil, stone, or wood in temperate and boreal regions, forming dense, mat-like patches. The thallus is usually green to yellowish in color, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It contains various photobionts, primarily green algae, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to pollution."
