    "intro": "Glaucium acutidentatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other related species. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Glaucium acutidentatum is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
