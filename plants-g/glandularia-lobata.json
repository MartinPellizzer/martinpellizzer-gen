    "intro": "Glandularia lobata, commonly known as the sticky verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky resin, which can deter herbivores and aid in water retention. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. The glandular structures on its leaves and stems are a key botanical feature, contributing to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations."
