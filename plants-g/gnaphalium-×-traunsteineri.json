    "intro": "Gnaphalium \u00d7 traunsteineri, commonly known as the hybrid everlasting flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. This plant is valued for its ornamental use in gardens and as a source of dried floral material for floral arrangements."
