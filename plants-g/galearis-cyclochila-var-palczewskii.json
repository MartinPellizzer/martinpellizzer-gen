    "intro": "Galearis cyclochila var. palczewskii, commonly known as the Palczewski's gentian, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its blue to violet flowers, which bloom in early summer, and its slender, upright stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
