    "intro": "Gelasine elongata, commonly known as the longleaf gelasine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous and well-developed, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Gelasine elongata is often found in shaded, forested areas where it plays a minor role in the local ecosystem."
