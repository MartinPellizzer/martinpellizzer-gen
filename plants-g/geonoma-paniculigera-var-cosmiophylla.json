    "intro": "Geonoma paniculigera var. cosmiophylla, commonly known as the Cosmiophylla geonoma, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive pattern of veins that aid in water retention. This variant is noted for its unique leaf morphology, which sets it apart from other members of the Geonoma genus."
