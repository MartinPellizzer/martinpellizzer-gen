    "intro": "Galium \u00d7 ochroleucum var. pseudocinereum, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies that help stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
