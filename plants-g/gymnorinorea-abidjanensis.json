    "intro": "Gymnorinorea abidjanensis, commonly known as the Abidjan orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to West Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as tropical rainforests, where it thrives on the forest floor or on tree trunks. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, with a smooth surface, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
