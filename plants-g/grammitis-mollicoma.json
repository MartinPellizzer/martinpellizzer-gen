    "intro": "Grammitis mollicoma, commonly known as velvet fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Grammitis mollicoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor gardens."
