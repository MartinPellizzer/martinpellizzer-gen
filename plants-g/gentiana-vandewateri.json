    "intro": "Gentiana vandewateri, commonly known as Vandewater's gentian, is a rare flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet petals and is typically found in high-altitude meadows. The plant has a short stem with few leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
