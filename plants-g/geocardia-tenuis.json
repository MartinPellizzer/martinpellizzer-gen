    "intro": "Geocardia tenuis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in harsh environments such as rocky soils and sandy substrates, often found in high-altitude or polar climates. The plant has small, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early summer. Geocardia tenuis plays a role in stabilizing soil in extreme environments and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
