    "intro": "Gentiana portensis, commonly known as the Portentous gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually unbranched and somewhat woody at the base. Gentiana portensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
