It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in agroforestry and soil improvement. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods, and the tree is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
