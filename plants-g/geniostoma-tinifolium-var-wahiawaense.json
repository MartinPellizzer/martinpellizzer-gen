    "intro": "Geniostoma tinifolium var. wahiawaense, commonly known as the Wahiawa lily, is a rare Hawaiian plant species belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers with prominent yellow markings, which bloom during the winter months. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of rainforests, where it thrives in the unique microclimate of Hawaii's volcanic soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, this variety is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its survival."
