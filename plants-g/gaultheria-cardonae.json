    "intro": "Gaultheria cardonae, commonly known as the Antarctic wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the cold regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is also noted for its aromatic leaves, which contain compounds similar to those found in other members of the Ericaceae family. Gaultheria cardonae is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in cool, moist climates."
