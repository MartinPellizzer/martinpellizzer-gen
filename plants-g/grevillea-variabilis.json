    "intro": "Grevillea variabilis, commonly known as the variable grevillea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, feather-like inflorescences that range in color from red to orange and yellow. The plant produces small, nectar-rich flowers that attract a variety of pollinators, including birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often with a bluish or greyish hue. Grevillea variabilis is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathland and coastal dunes."
