It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses where it can flourish."
