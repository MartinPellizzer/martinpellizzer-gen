    "intro": "Genoplesium confertum, commonly known as the dense orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. The plant produces striking, often fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
