    "intro": "Glechoma sibirica, commonly known as Siberian ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its aromatic leaves and ability to spread through runners make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in gardens."
