    "intro": "Gynochthodes nigra, commonly known as the black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and heart-shaped, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark, smooth berries. It thrives in moist soils near streams, rivers, and wetlands, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems. Its botanical features make it well adapted to aquatic environments and a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
