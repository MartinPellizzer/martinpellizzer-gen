    "intro": "Glochidion poeppigianum, commonly known as the roughleaf glabrous tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, often fissured bark and elliptical to ovate leaves that are usually leathery in texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by globose, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Glochidion poeppigianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
