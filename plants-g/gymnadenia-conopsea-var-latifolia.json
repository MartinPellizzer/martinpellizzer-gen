    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, upright stems and striking blue or purple flowers. The leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variant is distinguished by its wider leaves compared to the typical form of Gymnadenia conopsea. It typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
