    "intro": "Grastidium agusanense, commonly known as the Agusan mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that grow in a compact, clustered form. The plant typically thrives in shaded, humid environments within montane forests. Its leaves are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a unique trait that aids in its survival. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
