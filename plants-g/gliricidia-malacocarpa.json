    "intro": "Gliricidia malacocarpa, commonly known as the tropical bean tree, is a fast-growing leguminous shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, fragrant white or yellowish flowers that attract pollinators. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable for soil enrichment and agroforestry. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod and are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein."
