    "intro": "Gastrochilus sutepensis, commonly known as the Sutep's toothed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive toothed leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
