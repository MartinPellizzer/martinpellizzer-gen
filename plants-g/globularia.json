    "intro": "Globularia, commonly known as globe thistle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spherical, spiky flower heads that resemble small globes, typically in shades of blue or purple. The plants are native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. Globularia species are generally low-growing perennials with silver-gray foliage that adds ornamental value to gardens. They are valued for their drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
