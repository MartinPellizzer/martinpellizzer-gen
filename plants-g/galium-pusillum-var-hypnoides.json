    "intro": "Galium pusillum var. hypnoides, commonly known as the creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
