    "intro": "Geonoma venosa, commonly known as the veined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its intricate, veined fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. Geonoma venosa plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
