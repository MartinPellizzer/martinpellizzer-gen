It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Glossorhyncha altigena plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in rocky or disturbed areas."
