    "intro": "Gaultheria morobeensis var. morobeensis, commonly known as the Morobe wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the highland regions of Papua New Guinea. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, waxy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that are typically visited by insects and birds. Its fruits are small, dark berries that ripen in the late summer and autumn. Gaultheria morobeensis var. morobeensis is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
