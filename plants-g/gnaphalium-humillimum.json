    "intro": "Gnaphalium humillimum, commonly known as the common everlasting or dwarf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a low-growing herb with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its dense clusters of small, pale yellow to white flower heads. The plant produces numerous tiny, thread-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid regions. Its foliage is covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. It is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
