It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring upright, hairy stems that are often reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are usually palmately lobed, with a rough texture and a strong, somewhat aromatic scent. Geranium subnudicaule is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties."
