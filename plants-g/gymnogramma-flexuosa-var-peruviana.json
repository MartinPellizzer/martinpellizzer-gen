    "intro": "Gymnogramma flexuosa var. peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian kidney fern, is a tropical fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate pinnae arranged along the rachis. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
