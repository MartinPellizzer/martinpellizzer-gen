    "intro": "Grubbia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Grubbia tomentosa is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
