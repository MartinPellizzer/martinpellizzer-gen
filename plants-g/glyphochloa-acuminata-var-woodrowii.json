    "intro": "Glyphochloa acuminata var. woodrowii, commonly known as Woodrow's spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface. This variety is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
