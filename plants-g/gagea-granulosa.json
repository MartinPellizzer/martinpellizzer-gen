    "intro": "Gagea granulosa, commonly known as the granular gagea, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and bears bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are small and fibrous, adapted for survival in arid conditions. Gagea granulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
