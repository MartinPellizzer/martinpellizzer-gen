    "intro": "Gagea dayana, commonly known as the Armenian spring beauty, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed, and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Gagea dayana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
