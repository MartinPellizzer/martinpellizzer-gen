    "intro": "Goodyera fimbrilabia, commonly known as the fringe-leaf bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and bogs, often growing on the forest floor or along stream banks. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
