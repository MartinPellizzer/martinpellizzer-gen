    "intro": "Gelasia desertorum, commonly known as the desert gelasia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater in dry soils. Gelasia desertorum is well-suited to harsh desert environments and is often used in traditional medicine."
