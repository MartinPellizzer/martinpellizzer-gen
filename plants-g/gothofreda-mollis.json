    "intro": "Gothofreda mollis, commonly known as the soft-leaved ghostflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves that appear to shimmer in the sunlight, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom during the short summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Gothofreda mollis is considered a species of conservation concern."
