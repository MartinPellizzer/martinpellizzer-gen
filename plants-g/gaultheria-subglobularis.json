    "intro": "Gaultheria subglobularis, commonly known as the dwarf strawberry shrub, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, edible berries that resemble strawberries in appearance. Gaultheria subglobularis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also valued for its use in traditional medicine. It prefers cool, moist environments and is commonly found in high-altitude cloud forests."
