    "intro": "Galium pogonanthum f. trichopetalum, commonly known as the hairy bedstraw, is a variant of the bedstraw plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often hairy stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
