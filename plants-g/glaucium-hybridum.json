    "intro": "Glaucium hybridum, commonly known as the hybrid hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other well-known plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive waxy coating that gives them a bluish-green appearance. Glaucium hybridum is often found in meadows and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
