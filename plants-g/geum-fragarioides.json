    "intro": "Geum fragarioides, commonly known as wild strawberry, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its runners that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its fruits, which resemble strawberries, are edible and have a mild, sweet flavor. Geum fragarioides thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas."
