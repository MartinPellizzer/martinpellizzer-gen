It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color, which bloom in the spring. Gymnodes spicata is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic study."
