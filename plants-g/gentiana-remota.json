It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually unbranched and somewhat woody at the base.
