    "intro": "Geonoma barbigera, commonly known as the hairy-veined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with distinctive hairy veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil, while its spores are dispersed by wind. The leaves are usually evergreen, contributing to its role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
