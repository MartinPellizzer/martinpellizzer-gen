    "intro": "Gunnarella robertsii, commonly known as the Roberts' gunnaria, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are typically pink or red. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Gunnarella robertsii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
