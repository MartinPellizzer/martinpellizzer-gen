    "intro": "Gomphocarpus fruticosus subsp. setosus, commonly known as the sticky milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap is toxic and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The subspecies setosus is distinguished by its more densely hairy stems and leaves compared to other subspecies."
