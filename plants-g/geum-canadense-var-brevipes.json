It features bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early to mid-summer. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
