    "intro": "Gymnema sylvestre var. affine, commonly known as the Indian gymnema or the sugar plant, is a climbing shrub native to the forests of India and Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant is notable for its ability to reduce sugar absorption in the intestines, making it a subject of interest in traditional and modern medicine. Its leaves contain compounds such as gymnemic acids, which are believed to have hypoglycemic properties. This variant of Gymnema sylvestre is often cultivated for its medicinal and functional uses in herbal remedies."
