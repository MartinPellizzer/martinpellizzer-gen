    "intro": "Galtonia regalis, commonly known as the royal galtonia, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features tall, straight stems that bear large, showy white or pale pink flowers, which are often fragrant. The plant's leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, forming a dense rosette at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Galtonia regalis is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
