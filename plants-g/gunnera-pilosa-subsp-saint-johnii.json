    "intro": "Gunnera pilosa subsp. saint-johnii, commonly known as the Saint John's gunnera, is a striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, with a thick, waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its native high-altitude environment. The plant produces showy, terminal flower heads composed of numerous tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded conditions and is often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a popular ornamental plant in gardens with suitable conditions."
