    "intro": "Genista pilosa var. sylvatica, commonly known as the silky broom. It is a shrub native to Europe and parts of North Africa, characterized by its dense, spiny growth and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. While it is ornamental in gardens, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation."
