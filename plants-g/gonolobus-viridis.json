    "intro": "Gonolobus viridis, commonly known as the green globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and palmate leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. It has small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Gonolobus viridis is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
