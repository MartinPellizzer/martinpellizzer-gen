    "intro": "Guettarda lacornea, commonly known as the coral tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has a compact, rounded growth habit with multiple branches, making it suitable for hedges or ornamental planting. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a leathery texture, while its bark is smooth and reddish in color. Guettarda lacornea is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in coastal areas."
