    "intro": "Gilia beyrichiana, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gilia beyrichiana plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
