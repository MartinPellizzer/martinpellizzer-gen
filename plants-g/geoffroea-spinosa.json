    "intro": "Geoffroea spinosa, commonly known as the Chilean firetree, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is a small to medium-sized shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, leathery fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Geoffroea spinosa is known for its adaptability to harsh coastal environments and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
