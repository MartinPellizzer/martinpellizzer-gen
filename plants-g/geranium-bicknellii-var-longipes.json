    "intro": "Geranium bicknellii var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed bicknell geranium, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its woodland habitat. This variety is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an attractive and ecologically valuable plant in native gardens and conservation efforts."
