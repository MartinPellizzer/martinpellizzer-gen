    "intro": "Glandularia lobata var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth glandular currant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its glandular leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is usually smooth and lacks the hairy texture found in other varieties of Glandularia. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
