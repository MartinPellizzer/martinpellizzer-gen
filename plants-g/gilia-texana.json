    "intro": "Gilia texana, commonly known as the Texas gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Gilia texana is an annual herb that thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its seed pods split open to release small, hairy seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
