    "intro": "Genista tinctoria subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy yellow broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems covered in fine, glandular hairs, which give it its subspecies name \"pubescens.\" The plant produces bright yellow, raceme-like inflorescences composed of small, spurred flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are pinnate, with several pairs of small, oval leaflets, and the plant is often found in sunny, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in dye production."
