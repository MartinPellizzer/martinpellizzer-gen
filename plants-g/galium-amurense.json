    "intro": "Galium amurense, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are typically white or pale green, blooming in late spring to early summer. Galium amurense is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks, roadsides, and in meadows."
