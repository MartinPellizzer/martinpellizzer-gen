    "intro": "Glochidion sisparense, commonly known as the Philippine glabrous leafvine, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glabrous or nearly hairless. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as montane forests and is often found in secondary vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
