    "intro": "Gratiola anagallis, commonly known as the common yellow water-lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early summer, typically on slender, erect stems. The plant thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found near ponds, ditches, and stream banks. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, floating on the water's surface, while its roots form a dense mat that helps stabilize the soil. Gratiola anagallis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
