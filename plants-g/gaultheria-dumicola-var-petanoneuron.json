    "intro": "Gaultheria dumicola var. petanoneuron, commonly known as the Chilean wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Chile. It features dense, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. These fruits are edible and have a sharp, aromatic flavor similar to that of wintergreen. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in temperate rainforests."
