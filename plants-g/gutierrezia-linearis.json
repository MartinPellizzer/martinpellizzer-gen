    "intro": "Gutierrezia linearis, commonly known as linear goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid climates. Its linear, grass-like leaves and yellow flowers make it easily identifiable, and it often blooms from late spring to early summer. Gutierrezia linearis is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
