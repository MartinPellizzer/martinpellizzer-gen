    "intro": "Galium subvillosum var. subglabrum, commonly known as the smooth bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features slender, prostrate stems that are covered with small, glandular dots, though the variety subglabrum has a smoother appearance. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This plant is notable for its delicate appearance and its role in supporting local insect populations."
