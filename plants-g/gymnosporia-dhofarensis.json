    "intro": "Gymnosporia dhofarensis, commonly known as the Dhofar thornbush, is a shrub native to the southern Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and high temperatures. Gymnosporia dhofarensis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
