    "intro": "Gentiana triflora f. montana, commonly known as the mountain gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are often hairy. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
