It belongs to the Goodeniaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows in shrubland and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are large, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
