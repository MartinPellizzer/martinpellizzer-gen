    "intro": "Gonzalagunia rudis, commonly known as the roughleaf gorse, is a shrub native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the dry season. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins, and it thrives in coastal and rocky habitats. Gonzalagunia rudis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. However, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species due to habitat loss and invasive species competition."
