It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and small, pea-like flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in dry environments. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and native landscaping."
