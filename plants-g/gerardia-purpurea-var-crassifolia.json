    "intro": "Gerardia purpurea var. crassifolia, commonly known as the purple gerardia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, branching stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a bluish-green hue and a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and typically range in color from pink to purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. This plant is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a resilient species in Mediterranean climates."
