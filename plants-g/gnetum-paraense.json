    "intro": "Gnetum paraense, commonly known as the Amazonian gnetum, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the gymnosperm group, making it one of the few gymnosperms that produce leaves, flowers, and seeds. The plant has a distinctive morphology, featuring compound leaves with a smooth, waxy surface and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange aril, which aids in seed dispersal. Gnetum paraense thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests."
