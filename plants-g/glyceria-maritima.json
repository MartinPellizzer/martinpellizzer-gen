    "intro": "Glyceria maritima, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in tidal marshes and salt meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Glyceria maritima is well-adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
