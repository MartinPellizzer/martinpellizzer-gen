    "intro": "Gnaphalium spicatum var. consanguineum, commonly known as the woolly cudweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish-white fluffy heads of tiny florets, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils and is found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. It has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and leaves, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in composite heads. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
