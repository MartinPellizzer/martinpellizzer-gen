It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant with fleshy, ribbed stems and hairy, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-centered flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and has a deep root system to access water. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
