    "intro": "Glycosmis cyanocarpa var. wirawanii, commonly known as the blue-fruited holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by blue-black berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and striking fruit color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade."
