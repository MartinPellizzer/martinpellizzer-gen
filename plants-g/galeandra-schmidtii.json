    "intro": "Galeandra schmidtii, commonly known as Schmidt's galeandra, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure and is often found growing in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces striking, colorful flowers that are typically borne on slender, erect stems. Galeandra schmidtii is relatively small in size, with delicate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
