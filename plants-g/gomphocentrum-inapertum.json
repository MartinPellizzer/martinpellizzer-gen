    "intro": "Gomphocentrum inapertum, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to eastern and southern Africa. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds when mature."
