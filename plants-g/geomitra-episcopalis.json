    "intro": "Geomitra episcopalis, commonly known as the bishop's geometra, is a species of moth in the family Geometridae. It is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in forested areas with a preference for moist, shaded habitats. The adult moth has a distinctive wing pattern with intricate geometric markings that provide camouflage against tree bark. Its larvae feed on various deciduous trees, primarily feeding on species such as oak and birch. The life cycle of this moth is closely tied to the seasonal cycles of its host plants, making it an important indicator species for forest health."
