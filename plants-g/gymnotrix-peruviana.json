    "intro": "Gymnotrix peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, ghostly appearance with pale, translucent leaves and delicate, white or pale pink flowers. This plant thrives in high-altitude cloud forests, where it often grows on trees or rocks, relying on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its specialized morphology allows it to adapt to the humid, shaded conditions of its native habitat. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Gymnotrix peruviana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
