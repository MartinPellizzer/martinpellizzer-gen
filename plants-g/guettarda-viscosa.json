    "intro": "Guettarda viscosa, commonly known as the evergreen shrub or silky mistletoe, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for water and nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes problematic in natural ecosystems."
