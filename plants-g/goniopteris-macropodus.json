It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with prominent, branching veins that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Goniopteris macropodus is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, showcasing its adaptability to humid climates."
