    "intro": "Grammitis synsora, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Grammitis synsora is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded habitats."
