    "intro": "Goswamia hitkishorei, commonly known as the Khasi orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the northeastern region of India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
