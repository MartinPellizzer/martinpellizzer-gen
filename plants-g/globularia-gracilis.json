It features small, spherical, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compact, mat-forming foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to withstand drought conditions."
