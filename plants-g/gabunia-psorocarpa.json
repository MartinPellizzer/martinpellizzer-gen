    "intro": "Gabunia psorocarpa, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Gabunia psorocarpa is valued for its fragrant wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
