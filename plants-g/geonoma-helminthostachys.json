    "intro": "Geonoma helminthostachys, commonly known as the spiral-veined fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with fine, linear segments that contribute to its ornamental appeal. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a feature typical of many fern species."
