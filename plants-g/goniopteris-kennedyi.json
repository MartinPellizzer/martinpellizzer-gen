    "intro": "Goniopteris kennedyi, commonly known as Kennedy's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Goniopteris kennedyi plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
