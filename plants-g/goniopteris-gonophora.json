    "intro": "Goniopteris gonophora, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, tree-like trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a long, fibrous root system that helps anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators. This unique botanical feature makes it a striking and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
