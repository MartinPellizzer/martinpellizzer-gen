    "intro": "Glyptopetalum palawanense, commonly known as the Palawan rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the limestone regions of Palawan, Philippines. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and produces small, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, fragrant aroma. The plant has strap-like leaves that are adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanical research. Conservation efforts are crucial due to habitat destruction and illegal collection."
