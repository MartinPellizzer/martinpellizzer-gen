    "intro": "Galliaria prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate galliaria, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its small, alternate leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Galliaria prostrata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks."
