    "intro": "Gagea foliosa var. micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. It produces a compact bulb that stores nutrients for the next growing season. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
