    "intro": "Goodyera flabellata, commonly known as the lady's tears, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of broad, glossy, waxy leaves that form a dense, low-growing mat. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, green, and yellow, typically in late spring to early summer. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. Goodyera flabellata thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands."
