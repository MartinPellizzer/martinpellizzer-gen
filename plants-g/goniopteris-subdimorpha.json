It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. The plant features bipinnate fronds with a unique dimorphic structure, where the upper and lower pinnae differ in shape and size. Its reproductive structures include sori that are arranged in lines along the margins of the fronds. This fern is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes."
