    "intro": "Guapira petenensis, commonly known as the Pet\u00e9n guapira, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, lowland forests and is often found in secondary growth areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and relatively understudied species."
