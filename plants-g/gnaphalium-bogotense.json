    "intro": "Gnaphalium bogotense, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it is known for its ability to thrive in moist, high-altitude environments. Gnaphalium bogotense is often found in open grasslands and rocky slopes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitat. Its name \"everlasting\" refers to the durability of its dried flower heads, which retain their shape and color for extended periods."
