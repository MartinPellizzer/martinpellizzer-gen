    "intro": "Gilia dianthoides var. farinosa, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, typically appearing in clusters. The plant has hairy, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. The species is adapted to full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
