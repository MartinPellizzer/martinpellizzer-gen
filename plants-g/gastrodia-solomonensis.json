    "intro": "Gastrodia solomonensis, commonly known as the Solomon's ginseng, is a rare orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a tuberous plant that lacks true leaves and relies on its underground stem for photosynthesis. The plant produces a single, fleshy, club-shaped fruit that contains several seeds. It is often found growing in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and medicinal properties, it is highly valued in traditional herbal medicine."
