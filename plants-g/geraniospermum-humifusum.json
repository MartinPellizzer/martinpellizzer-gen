    "intro": "Geraniospermum humifusum, commonly known as the low-growing geranium, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, typically during the warmer months. Its growth habit is prostrate, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
