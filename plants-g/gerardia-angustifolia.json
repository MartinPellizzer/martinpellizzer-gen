    "intro": "Gerardia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf gerardia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences and are usually blue to purple in color. Gerardia angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
