    "intro": "Glyceria capillaris, commonly known as slender glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like in appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. Glyceria capillaris plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
