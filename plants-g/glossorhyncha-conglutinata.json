    "intro": "Glossorhyncha conglutinata, commonly known as the sticky false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a sticky, glandular substance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine. The sticky secretions on its leaves serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
