    "intro": "Grammitis calcipunctata, commonly known as the calciphile fern, is a species of fern that thrives in calcium-rich environments. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant prefers well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis calcipunctata plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to calcareous soils."
