    "intro": "Gaultheria glauciflora, commonly known as the silverleaf wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that often has a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Gaultheria glauciflora thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its aromatic properties."
