    "intro": "Gnaphalium virgatum, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense mats of small, hairy, gray-green leaves and produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its finely divided foliage and the presence of glandular hairs that release a fragrant, sticky substance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Gnaphalium virgatum is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
