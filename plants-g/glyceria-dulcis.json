It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often\u4e1b\u751f, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually smooth and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers that are wind-pollinated.
