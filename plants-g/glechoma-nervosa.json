    "intro": "Glechoma nervosa, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white underside and produces small, blue to purple flowers in late spring. The plant spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ground cover."
