    "intro": "Grastidium insigne, commonly known as the noble orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring or early summer, producing clusters of pale pink to white petals with a subtle, sweet aroma. Grastidium insigne thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to its limited habitat and endangered status, it is a subject of conservation efforts to protect its natural ecosystem."
