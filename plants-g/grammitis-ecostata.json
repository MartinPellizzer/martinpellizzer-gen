    "intro": "Grammitis ecostata, commonly known as the coastal grammitis, is a fern native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a bluish-green hue. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found along rocky shores and in humid forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis ecostata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
