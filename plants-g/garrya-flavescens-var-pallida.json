    "intro": "Garrya flavescens var. pallida, commonly known as the white-flowered silky oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white, silky-hairy foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, oval berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Its ornamental value is due to its unique foliage and seasonal flowering."
