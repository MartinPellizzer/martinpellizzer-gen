    "intro": "Goodyera purpusii, commonly known as the purple lady's tresses, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It possesses a unique rosette-like structure of leaves that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in a spiral arrangement, typically in shades of purple and white. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
