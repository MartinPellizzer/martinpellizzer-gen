    "intro": "Gentiana riparia subsp. riparia, commonly known as the riparian gentian, is a perennial herb native to moist, temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows along streams, rivers, and wet meadows, where it thrives in well-drained to slightly boggy soils. The plant features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are upright and branched. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in riparian ecosystems."
