    "intro": "Guatteria chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden-leaf guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Annonaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that exhibit a striking golden hue, especially when exposed to sunlight. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces a fruit that is generally a fleshy berry. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
