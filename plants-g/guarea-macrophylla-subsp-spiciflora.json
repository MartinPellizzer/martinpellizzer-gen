It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically in construction and furniture-making."
