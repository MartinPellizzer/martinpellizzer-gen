    "intro": "Geissanthus, commonly known as the mountain morning glory, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Andes Mountains of South America. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The leaves are usually alternate and simple, with a leathery texture, while the stems are often woody and covered in fine hairs. Geissanthus species are adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
