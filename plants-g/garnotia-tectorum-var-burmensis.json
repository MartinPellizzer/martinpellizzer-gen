It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, often forming a low, mat-like structure. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity with potential ecological significance."
