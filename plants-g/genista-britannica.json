    "intro": "Genista britannica, commonly known as the British broom, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, thorned stems and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring, which are arranged in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its flowers are followed by small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Genista britannica is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, where it thrives in well-drained conditions."
