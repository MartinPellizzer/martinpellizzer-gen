It is a low-growing herb with slender, ascending stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the unique climate of its native range. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
