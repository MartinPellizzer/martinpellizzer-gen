    "intro": "Glyphotaenium insidiosum, commonly known as the insidious glyphotaenium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Its small white to greenish flowers are clustered in umbrella-like structures, typical of the carrot family. While not widely cultivated, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
