    "intro": "Geniosporum prostratum var. longiracemosum, commonly known as the long-branch geniosporum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils. It is often found in wetlands and along the edges of swamps, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
