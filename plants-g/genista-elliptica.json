    "intro": "Genista elliptica, commonly known as the narrowleaf broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant features slender, erect stems with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers, which appear in spring, are clustered in dense racemes and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Genista elliptica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardy nature and drought tolerance."
