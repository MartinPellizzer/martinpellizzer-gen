    "intro": "Gouldia konaensis var. latifolia, commonly known as the Kona broadleaf gouldia, is a rare and unique plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kona. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for ecological and botanical study."
