It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Gymnogramma regnelliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
