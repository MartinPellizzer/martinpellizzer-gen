    "intro": "Galium migrans subsp. migrans, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that can cover the ground effectively. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitats."
