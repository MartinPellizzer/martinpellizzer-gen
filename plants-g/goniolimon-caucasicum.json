It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in full sun.
