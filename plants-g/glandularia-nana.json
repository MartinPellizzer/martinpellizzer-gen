    "intro": "Glandularia nana, commonly known as the dwarf verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, herbaceous annual or perennial that typically grows to a height of less than 10 inches. The plant features opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves with glandular dots that secrete oils, giving it its scientific name. Its flowers are typically blue to purple, arranged in dense spikes, and bloom from summer to fall. Glandularia nana is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
