    "intro": "Gossypium stephensii, commonly known as Stephens cotton, is a wild species of cotton native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub-like plant that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers and has capsule fruits that contain fluffy, white fibers used for textile purposes. It is closely related to other cotton species and is of interest to botanists and geneticists due to its unique adaptations. Gossypium stephensii plays a role in ecological studies and may contribute to the genetic diversity of cultivated cotton varieties."
