    "intro": "Gymnogramma helenensis, commonly known as the Helen's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. Gymnogramma helenensis prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
