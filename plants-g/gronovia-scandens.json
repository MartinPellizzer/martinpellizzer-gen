    "intro": "Gronovia scandens, commonly known as the climbing geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems that can climb or trail along the ground, making it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are typically rounded and have a slightly hairy texture, adding a tactile element to its appearance. Gronovia scandens is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and Mediterranean-style gardens."
