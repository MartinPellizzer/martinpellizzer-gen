It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports aquatic life. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, are short-lived but highly ornamental. Guzmania picta thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its vibrant appearance."
