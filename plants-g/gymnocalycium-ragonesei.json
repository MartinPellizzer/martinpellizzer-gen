    "intro": "Gymnocalycium ragonesei, commonly known as the Ragonese prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Gymnocalycium ragonesei is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stems to survive drought conditions. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
