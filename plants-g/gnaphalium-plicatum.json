    "intro": "Gnaphalium plicatum, commonly known as the zigzag everlasting, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and New Mexico, and thrives in arid and rocky environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
