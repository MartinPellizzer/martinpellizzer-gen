    "intro": "Gymnogramma aurea, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are covered in a dense layer of golden-hued, velvety scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rock crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Gymnogramma aurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
