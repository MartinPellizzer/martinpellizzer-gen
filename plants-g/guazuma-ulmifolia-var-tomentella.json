    "intro": "Guazuma ulmifolia var. tomentella, commonly known as the tomentellum guazuma, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. This plant is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental qualities due to its unique texture and foliage."
