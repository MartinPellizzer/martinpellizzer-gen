    "intro": "Glycine pugiunculus, commonly known as the creeping soybean, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, hairy pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional herbal remedies. Glycine pugiunculus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its natural habitat."
