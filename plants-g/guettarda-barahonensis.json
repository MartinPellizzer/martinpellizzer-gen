    "intro": "Guettarda barahonensis, commonly known as the Bahamian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
