    "intro": "Gonolobus lozadae, commonly known as the Lozada's go-on-lobe, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale or yellowish in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gonolobus lozadae is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
