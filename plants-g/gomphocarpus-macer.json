It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking orange-red flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Gomphocarpus macer is a member of the Apocynaceae family, known for its milky sap and ecological importance to pollinators."
