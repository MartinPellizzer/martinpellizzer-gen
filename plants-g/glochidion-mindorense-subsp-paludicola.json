    "intro": "Glochidion mindorense subsp. paludicola, commonly known as the Mindanao glochidion, is a shrub native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered with fine, pubescent hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by smooth, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in lowland and montane rainforests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
