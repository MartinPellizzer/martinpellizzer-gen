    "intro": "Geissanthera hosokawae, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
