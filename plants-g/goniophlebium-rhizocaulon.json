It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizome that is covered in a dense mat of moss-like structures, giving it its common name. Its fronds are usually linear and have a delicate, feathery appearance. Goniophlebium rhizocaulon plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
