    "intro": "Galeopsis \u00d7 ludwigii, commonly known as the hybrid hogweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is a cross between Galeopsis tetrahit and Galeopsis speciosa, resulting in a plant with distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is often found in moist, open habitats and can spread rapidly due to its prolific seed production. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
