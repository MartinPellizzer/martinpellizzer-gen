It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded flower heads that resemble small globes, hence its common name. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, clustered flowers. Globeria species are often found in moist, temperate regions and thrive in partial to full shade. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to bloom in early spring."
