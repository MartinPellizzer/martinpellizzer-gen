    "intro": "Gentiana lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and streambanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hence the species name, and are often arranged in a basal rosette. Gentiana lanceolata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
