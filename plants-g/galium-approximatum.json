    "intro": "Galium approximatum, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium approximatum is known for its edible leaves, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their oxalic acid content."
