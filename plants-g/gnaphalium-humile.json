    "intro": "Gnaphalium humile, commonly known as the common everlasting or dwarf everlasting, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds and has hairy, often silver-tomentose foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. Its aromatic properties and drought tolerance make it a resilient and hardy plant in various ecological settings."
