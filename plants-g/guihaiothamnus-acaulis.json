    "intro": "Guihaiothamnus acaulis, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a unique evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, forming a low, rounded cushion-like structure. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise muted appearance. Due to its specialized adaptations, it is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters."
