    "intro": "Geranium repens, commonly known as the creeping geranium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Geranium repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as ground cover due to its hardy nature."
