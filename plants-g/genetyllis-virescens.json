It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally wet habitats, such as marshes and swamps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually green to bluish-green in color. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. Genetyllis virescens plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
