    "intro": "Glechoma hederacea f. rosea, commonly known as the pink ivy or pink ground ivy, is a variant of the common ground ivy. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pink to lavender flowers. The plant has a creeping habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. Its foliage is typically covered in fine hairs, and it prefers moist, shady environments. It is often found in gardens and wild areas, where it can act as a ground cover or weed."
