    "intro": "Gladiolimon, commonly known as the water lily, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, waterborne flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes, where it plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems. Its roots are submerged, while its stems and leaves are adapted for life on the water's surface. The flowers typically open in the early morning and close in the afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty."
