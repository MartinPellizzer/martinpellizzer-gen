    "intro": "Gentiana verna var. favratii, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and shorter pedicels compared to the typical form of *Gentiana verna*."
