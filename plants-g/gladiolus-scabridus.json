It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, colorful flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a rough, scabrous texture, giving it its common name. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in various regions beyond its native habitat."
