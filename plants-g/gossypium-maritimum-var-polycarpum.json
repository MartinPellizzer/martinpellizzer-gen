    "intro": "Gossypium maritimum var. polycarpum, commonly known as the coastal cotton or sea cotton, is a variant of the cotton plant adapted to saline and coastal environments. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and produces small, fluffy bolls containing cotton fibers. This species is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of the Middle East, where it thrives in coastal areas with high salinity. Its fibers are shorter and coarser compared to other cotton varieties, making it less commercially valuable but more resilient to harsh conditions. The plant plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
