    "intro": "Goniophlebium vacciniifolium, commonly known as the redstem sedgeland, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically reddish at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its botanical structure is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions, with a fibrous root system and a low-growing habit."
