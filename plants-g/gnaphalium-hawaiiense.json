    "intro": "Gnaphalium hawaiiense, commonly known as the Hawaiian feathergrass, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, fluffy flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and coastal areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flower heads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Hawaii."
