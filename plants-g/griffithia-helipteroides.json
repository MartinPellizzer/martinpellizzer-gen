    "intro": "Griffithia helipteroides, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native trees such as pohutukawa and kahikatea. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are arranged in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It is adapted to thrive in the cool, humid conditions of New Zealand's forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in several conservation areas."
