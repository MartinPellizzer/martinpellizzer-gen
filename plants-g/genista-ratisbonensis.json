    "intro": "Genista ratisbonensis, commonly known as the Ratisbon broom, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe, particularly found in rocky and coastal areas. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by narrow, needle-like leaves. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its invasive tendencies in certain regions."
