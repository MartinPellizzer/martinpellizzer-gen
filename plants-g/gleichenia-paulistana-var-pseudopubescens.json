    "intro": "Gleichenia paulistana var. pseudopubescens, commonly known as the Brazilian wood fern, is a fern species native to South America. It belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and often covered with a layer of fine, pubescent hairs. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat."
