    "intro": "Genista nervosa, commonly known as the slender broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has wiry, thornless stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in temperate climates. Genista nervosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
