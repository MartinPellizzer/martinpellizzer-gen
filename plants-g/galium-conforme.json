    "intro": "Galium conforme, commonly known as creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of delicate white or yellow flowers. The plant has a sprawling habit, with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily across moist, shaded areas. Its flowers typically bloom in early spring, and the plant is often found in woodland or grassy habitats. Galium conforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
