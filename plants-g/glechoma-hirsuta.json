    "intro": "Glechoma hirsuta, commonly known as creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern and produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its stems spread along the ground, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Glechoma hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
