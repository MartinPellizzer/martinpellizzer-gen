    "intro": "Gonzalagunia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly gonzalagunia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often found in cloud forests. Its foliage is covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. Gonzalagunia tomentosa is primarily valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
