It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with glandular structures, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a faintly aromatic scent. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
