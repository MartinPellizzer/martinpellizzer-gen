    "intro": "Gyrostachys orchioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the bark of trees in the understory of forests. The plant has long, slender roots and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Due to habitat destruction, it is listed as endangered in several states, highlighting the need for its protection."
