    "intro": "Grewia parviflora f. angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf false holly, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features small, elliptical leaves that are narrow and dark green, often with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers in the summer, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and seasonal flowering."
