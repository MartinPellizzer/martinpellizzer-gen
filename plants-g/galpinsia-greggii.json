    "intro": "Galpinsia greggii, commonly known as Gregg's milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Gregg's milkweed is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
