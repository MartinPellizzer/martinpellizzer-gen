    "intro": "Geranium sonderianum, commonly known as the African geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy texture, and produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough, serrated margin, and they are often covered in fine hairs. This plant is well adapted to dry conditions and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its botanical characteristics make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitat."
