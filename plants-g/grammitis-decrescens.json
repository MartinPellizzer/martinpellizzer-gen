    "intro": "Grammitis decrescens, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on trees or rocks, forming dense, low mats with narrow, linear leaves. The leaves are usually dark green and have a smooth, leathery texture. It produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of the leaves, which are characteristic of the Polypodiaceae family. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
