    "intro": "Grindelia leptocarpa, commonly known as desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in desert scrub and rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. Grindelia leptocarpa is also known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which can be a deterrent to herbivores."
