    "intro": "Gomphocarpus longissimus, commonly known as the long-stemmed milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Gomphocarpus longissimus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought conditions."
