    "intro": "Gesneria viridiflora subsp. acrochordonanthe, commonly known as the velvetleaf gesneria, is a species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a slight sheen. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
