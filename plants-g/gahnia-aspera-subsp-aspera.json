    "intro": "Gahnia aspera subsp. aspera, commonly known as the rough tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and long, fibrous leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces panicles of spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color, and it is often found in wetland or swampy areas. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Gahnia aspera subsp. aspera is well adapted to moist environments and can tolerate seasonal flooding."
