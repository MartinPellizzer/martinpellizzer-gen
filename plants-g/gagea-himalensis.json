    "intro": "Gagea himalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan gagea, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often clustered in a umbel-like structure. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive in its alpine habitat. Gagea himalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
