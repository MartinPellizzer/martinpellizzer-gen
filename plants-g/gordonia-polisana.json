    "intro": "Gordonia polisana, commonly known as the Polisana beech, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by dark blue, waxy berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
