    "intro": "Guillauminia bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's guillauminia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright red. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Guillauminia bakeri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
