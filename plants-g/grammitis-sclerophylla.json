    "intro": "Grammitis sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Australia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are densely packed and often have a waxy coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Grammitis sclerophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique foliage."
