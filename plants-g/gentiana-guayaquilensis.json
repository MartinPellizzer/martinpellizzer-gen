    "intro": "Gentiana guayaquilensis, commonly known as the Guayaquil gentian, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Gentiana guayaquilensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and ecological significance."
