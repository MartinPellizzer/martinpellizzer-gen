    "intro": "Gordonia havilandii, commonly known as the Haviland's beech, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
