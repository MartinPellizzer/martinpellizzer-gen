    "intro": "Galanthus nivalis, commonly known as the snowdrop, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, nodding white flowers with a yellow-green spathe, which bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in woodland and shaded areas, preferring moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a bulb that stores nutrients for the next growing season. Galanthus nivalis is notable for its resilience and is often one of the first flowers to appear in the spring."
