    "intro": "Gnaphalium aristatum, commonly known as the slender feathercup, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, and it produces small, yellow to white flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are linear and often covered with fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
