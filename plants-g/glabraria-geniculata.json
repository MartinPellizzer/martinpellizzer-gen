    "intro": "Glabraria geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments and requires moderate to high light conditions. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic habitats. Glabraria geniculata is also known for its ability to filter water and provide shelter for small aquatic organisms."
