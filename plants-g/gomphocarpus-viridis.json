    "intro": "Gomphocarpus viridis, commonly known as the green milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Gomphocarpus viridis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
