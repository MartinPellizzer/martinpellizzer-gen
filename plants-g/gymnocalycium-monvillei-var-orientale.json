    "intro": "Gymnocalycium monvillei var. orientale, commonly known as the Oriental moon cactus, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to produce vibrant, showy flowers during the summer months. The plant features thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, adding a striking contrast to its green or blueish stems. This variety is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
