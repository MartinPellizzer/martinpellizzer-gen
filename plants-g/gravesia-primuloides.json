    "intro": "Gravesia primuloides, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a flowering plant native to the island of Mauritius. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom during the Christmas season. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green in color. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas or on rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
