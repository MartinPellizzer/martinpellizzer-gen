    "intro": "Githopsis diffusa subsp. robusta, commonly known as the robust githopsis, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and broad, oval leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers clustered in terminal panicles, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
