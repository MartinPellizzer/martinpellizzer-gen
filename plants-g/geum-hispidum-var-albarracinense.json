It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a serrated margin, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. This variant is distinguished by its geographic distribution and subtle floral characteristics compared to the typical form of Geum hispidum."
