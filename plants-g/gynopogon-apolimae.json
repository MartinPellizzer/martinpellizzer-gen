    "intro": "Gynopogon apolimae, commonly known as the Apolima gynopogon, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the island of Apolima in Samoa. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, a feature common in many grasses. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Gynopogon apolimae is considered critically endangered."
