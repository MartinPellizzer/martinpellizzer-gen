The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Galatella pastuchovii is considered a species of conservation concern."
