    "intro": "Grevillea montis-cole subsp. brevistyla, commonly known as the Mount Cole grevillea, is a shrub native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces striking, feather-like inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
