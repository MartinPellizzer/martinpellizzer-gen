It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often found in wildflower gardens and naturalized areas."
