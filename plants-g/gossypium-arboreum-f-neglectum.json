    "intro": "Gossypium arboreum f. neglectum, commonly known as the wild cotton plant, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and small, showy flowers. The plant produces fluffy, seed-coated fibers that are similar to those of cultivated cotton, though it is not widely used for commercial textile production. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm climate with adequate sunlight. This species is often found in disturbed habitats and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its ecological and genetic value."
