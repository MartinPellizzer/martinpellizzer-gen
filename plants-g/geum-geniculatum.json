    "intro": "Geum geniculatum, commonly known as the zigzag goldenroot, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its zigzagging stems, which give it its common name, and its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shady woodlands and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Geum geniculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
