    "intro": "Gironniera paucinervia, commonly known as the narrow-veined ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the dry regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, elliptical leaves with prominent, parallel veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
