    "intro": "Gaylussacia frondosa var. polycodioides, commonly known as the red spruce, is a shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, coniferous-like foliage, with dark green, needle-like leaves that are often tinged with red or bronze. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, which bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that attracts various birds and small mammals. This variety is adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as mountain forests."
