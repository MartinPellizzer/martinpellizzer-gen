It typically grows in open, rocky or sandy habitats, often in tundra or mountainous areas. The plant has slender, ascending stems that are often covered with short, stiff hairs. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters. The species is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
