    "intro": "Grammitis kalbreyeri, commonly known as the Kalbreyer's filmy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in forested areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis kalbreyeri plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to the biodiversity of epiphytic plant communities."
