    "intro": "Goniocaulon glabrum, commonly known as the smooth goniocaulon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its inflorescence consists of small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Goniocaulon glabrum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky outcrops."
