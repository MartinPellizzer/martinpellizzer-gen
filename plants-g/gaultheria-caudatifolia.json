    "intro": "Gaultheria caudatifolia, commonly known as the trailing wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It features dense, dark green foliage with leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous forests. Gaultheria caudatifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense ground cover in woodland gardens."
