It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that are covered in fine, hooked hairs. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a hairy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by small, three-lobed berries. This variant is adapted to a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and woodland edges, and is often found in moist environments."
