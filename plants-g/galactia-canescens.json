    "intro": "Galactia canescens, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in dry, rocky soils. Galactia canescens has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid environments. It is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
