    "intro": "Gomesa ranifera f. albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered gomesa, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species in the wild."
