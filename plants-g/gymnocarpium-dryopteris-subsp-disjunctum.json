    "intro": "Gymnocarpium dryopteris subsp. disjunctum, commonly known as the disjunct barren fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to specific regions of North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its unique frond structure, which features a narrow, linear shape with a distinct, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, a common trait among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
