    "intro": "Grammitis muscosa, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis muscosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
