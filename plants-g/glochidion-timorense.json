    "intro": "Glochidion timorense, commonly known as the Timor glabrous leaf. It is a small, evergreen shrub native to the island of Timor, characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are usually glabrous or nearly so. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, globose fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests or disturbed areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
