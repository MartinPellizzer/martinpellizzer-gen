    "intro": "Grammitis hellwigii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are often clustered closely together, forming a dense, mat-like structure. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are found on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Grammitis hellwigii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
