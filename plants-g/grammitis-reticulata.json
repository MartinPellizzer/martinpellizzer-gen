    "intro": "Grammitis reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined filmy fern, is a delicate and intricate epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, translucent fronds that resemble delicate lace. The plant's rhizomes are wiry and often grow along tree trunks or rocks, anchoring it in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically small, with a reticulate venation pattern that gives it its common name. Grammitis reticulata thrives in high humidity and requires consistent moisture, making it a popular choice for humid greenhouse settings."
