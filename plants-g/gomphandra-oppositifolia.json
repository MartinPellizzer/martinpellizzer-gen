    "intro": "Gomphandra oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved gomphandra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its opposite arrangement of leaves, which are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Gomphandra oppositifolia is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
