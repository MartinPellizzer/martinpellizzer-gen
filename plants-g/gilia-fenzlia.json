    "intro": "Gilia fenzlia, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments with its deep root system. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Gilia fenzlia plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native range."
