    "intro": "Goniothalamus calvicarpus, commonly known as the hairy-fruited talaud, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers, followed by distinctive fruits that are covered in short, stiff hairs. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, yellowish aril, which is a feature common in many Annonaceae species. Goniothalamus calvicarpus is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
