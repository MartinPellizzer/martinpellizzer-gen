It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its historical use in traditional medicine and its potential for ecological restoration, it has garnered interest among botanists and conservationists."
