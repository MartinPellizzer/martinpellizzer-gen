    "intro": "Glandularia atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama gumplant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Chile. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of purple or pink flowers, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to extreme drought conditions makes it a resilient species in the Atacama Desert. Glandularia atacamensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
