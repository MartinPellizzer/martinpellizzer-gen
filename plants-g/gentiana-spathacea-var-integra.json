It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine pubescence, while its stems are usually unbranched. The flowers are arranged in a dense spike and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and flies."
