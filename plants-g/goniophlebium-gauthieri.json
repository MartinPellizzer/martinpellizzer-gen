    "intro": "Goniophlebium gauthieri, commonly known as the Gauthier's moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant exhibits a distinctive thalloid structure, with a prostrate, leafy stem that forms dense mats on moist, shaded substrates. It is often found in temperate regions, growing on rocks, soil, or decaying wood. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
