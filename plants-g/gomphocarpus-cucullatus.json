    "intro": "Gomphocarpus cucullatus, commonly known as the crown-of-thorns, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is characterized by its spiny, thorn-covered stems. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Gomphocarpus cucullatus is well adapted to arid conditions and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils."
