    "intro": "Grossularia uva-crispa, commonly known as the snowball bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, tart berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated edge, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. The snowball bush is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cold climates."
