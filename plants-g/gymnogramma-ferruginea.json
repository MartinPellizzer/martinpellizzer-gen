    "intro": "Gymnogramma ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Gymnogramma ferruginea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
