    "intro": "Gerardia tenuifolia var. filiformis, commonly known as the slender-leaved gerardia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
