It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy green surface. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fruits that are typically oval and have a hard, woody shell. The fruit contains a single seed, which is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of edible oil. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
