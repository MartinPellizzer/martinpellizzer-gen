    "intro": "Gymnocalycium bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored moon cactus, is a succulent native to South America. It features a swollen, spiny stem that stores water, typical of cacti adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the growing season, adding a striking contrast to its green or blue-green stem. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection. Gymnocalycium bicolor is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
