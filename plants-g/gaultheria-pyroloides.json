    "intro": "Gaultheria pyroloides, commonly known as the dwarf snowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, dark green leaves that are leathery in texture and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and mammals. These fruits are particularly notable for their high concentration of salicylic acid, which gives them a sharp, medicinal taste. Gaultheria pyroloides thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows."
