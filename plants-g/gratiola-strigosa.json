    "intro": "Gratiola strigosa, commonly known as the hairy yellowroot, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Gratiola strigosa is often found in moist, wooded areas and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal use. Its root system is thick and fleshy, which helps it store moisture in its native habitat."
