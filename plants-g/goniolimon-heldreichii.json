    "intro": "Goniolimon heldreichii, commonly known as the Balkan goniolimon, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to arid conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in high-altitude environments with limited water availability. Its flowers are small and pinkish-white, often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it blooms during the summer months. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Goniolimon heldreichii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change."
