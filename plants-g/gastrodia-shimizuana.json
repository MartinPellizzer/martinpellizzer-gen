    "intro": "Gastrodia shimizuana, commonly known as the Shimizu's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrients. Native to the mountainous regions of Japan, it thrives in cool, shaded forest environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom briefly during the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
