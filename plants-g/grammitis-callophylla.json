    "intro": "Grammitis callophylla, commonly known as the golden grammitis, is a small fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually bright green, with a slightly hairy texture. It produces spores on the underside of its leaves, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Grammitis callophylla is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
