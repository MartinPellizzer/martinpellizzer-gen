    "intro": "Graecobolanthus thymifolius, commonly known as the thyme-leaved grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish flowers, typical of many grass species. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss. Graecobolanthus thymifolius is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is used in some traditional herbal remedies."
