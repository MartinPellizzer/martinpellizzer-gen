It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy flowers, which range from pink to purple, bloom in late summer and are clustered in dense inflorescences.
