It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can last for several months. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool that supports small aquatic life. Its foliage is often variegated with green, red, and yellow hues, adding to its ornamental appeal. Guzmania victoriae thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
