    "intro": "Gentiana algida var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as mountain meadows and rocky slopes. The plant features a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers during the summer months. Its flowers are typically smaller than those of the typical *Gentiana algida*, hence the variety name *parviflora*. The plant is adapted to high-altitude conditions with a short growing season and is often found in habitats with well-drained soil."
