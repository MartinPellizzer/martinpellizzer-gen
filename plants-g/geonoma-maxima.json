    "intro": "Geonoma maxima, commonly known as the giant fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, elegant fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered in a layer of persistent, fibrous roots. Its reproductive structures are borne on the fronds, with spore-producing sporangia clustered in sori. Geonoma maxima plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
