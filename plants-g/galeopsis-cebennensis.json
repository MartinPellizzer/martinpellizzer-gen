    "intro": "Galeopsis cebennensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved horseweed, is a herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as mint and basil. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, often along roadsides and in meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy surface, while its small blue or purple flowers bloom in whorls along the stem. Galeopsis cebennensis is characterized by its slender appearance and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
