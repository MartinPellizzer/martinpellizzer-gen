    "intro": "Geschollia calcarata, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its roots are often covered in a dense, white coating that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Geschollia calcarata is considered a vulnerable species."
