    "intro": "Geranium brycei, commonly known as the Bryce Canyon geranium, is a perennial herb native to the United States, specifically found in the high elevations of Utah and Nevada. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing vibrant pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Geranium brycei is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in mountainous environments."
