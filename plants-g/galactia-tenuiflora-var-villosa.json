    "intro": "Galactia tenuiflora var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy texture, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Galactia tenuiflora var. villosa is often found in desert grasslands and along rocky slopes."
