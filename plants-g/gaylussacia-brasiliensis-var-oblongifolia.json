    "intro": "Gaylussacia brasiliensis var. oblongifolia, commonly known as Brazilian huckleberry, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It features elliptical to oblong leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, bright red berries in the fall. These berries are often consumed by birds and mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitat."
