    "intro": "Geum canadense, commonly known as Canadian goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its showy inflorescences attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The genus Geum is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae), and Canadian goldenrod is valued for its ecological importance and ornamental appeal."
