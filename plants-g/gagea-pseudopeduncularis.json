    "intro": "Gagea pseudopeduncularis, commonly known as the western gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its clustered bulbs and grass-like foliage. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, appearing in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
