It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Galatella cretica is often found in rocky or limestone soils and is considered a rare species within its native habitat."
