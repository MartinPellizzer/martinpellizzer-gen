    "intro": "Gomphostemma bartlettii, commonly known as the Bartlett's gomphostemma, is a rare and woody climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Menispermaceae family, which includes several genera of tropical and subtropical plants. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruits are fleshy berries that turn red when mature, attracting various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
