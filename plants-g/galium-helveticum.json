    "intro": "Galium helveticum, commonly known as the Swiss bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs. Galium helveticum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
