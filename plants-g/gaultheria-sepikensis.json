    "intro": "Gaultheria sepikensis, commonly known as the Sepik Gaultheria, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Gaultheria sepikensis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
