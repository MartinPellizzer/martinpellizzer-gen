It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in dry, arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. Grindelia setulifera is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
