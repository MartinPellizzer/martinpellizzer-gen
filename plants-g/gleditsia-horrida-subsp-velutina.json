It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. The silky honeylocust is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
