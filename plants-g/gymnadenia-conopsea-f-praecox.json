    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea f. praecox, commonly known as the early red grass orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species characterized by its striking red and orange floral coloration. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the Alps and surrounding areas. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and the plant is known for its short stature and compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
