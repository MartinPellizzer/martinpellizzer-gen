    "intro": "Gymnobalanus punctata, commonly known as the mangrove apple, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in brackish water environments and plays an important role in coastal ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it a key species in mangrove forests."
