    "intro": "Grastidium juniperinum, commonly known as the silverleaf juniper, is a small evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are tightly pressed against the branches, giving it a dense, compact appearance. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It is adapted to hot, dry climates and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers. The foliage is often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration."
