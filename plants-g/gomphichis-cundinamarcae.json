    "intro": "Gomphichis cundinamarcae, commonly known as the Cundinamarca lily, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and mountainous areas. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
