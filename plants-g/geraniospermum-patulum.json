    "intro": "Geraniospermum patulum, commonly known as the narrowleaf geraniospermum, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae, which includes plants known for their showy flowers and often succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered, often in shades of pink or white, and bloom during the spring and early summer."
