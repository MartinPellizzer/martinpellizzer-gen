    "intro": "Grewia pandaica, commonly known as the panda bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, adding visual interest to the plant. Grewia pandaica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils."
