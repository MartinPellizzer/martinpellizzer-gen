    "intro": "Guzmania panamensis, commonly known as the Panama guzmania, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool that supports small aquatic life. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. Guzmania panamensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
