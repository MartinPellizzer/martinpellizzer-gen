    "intro": "Gothofreda jacobinae, commonly known as the Jacobina ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the light, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom only during the early morning hours. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Gothofreda jacobinae is considered a critically endangered species."
