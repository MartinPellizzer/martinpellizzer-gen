It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has distinctive, leathery, pale green leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its fronds are typically elongated and have a fibrous texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat.
