It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that range from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The species is also known for its ability to self-pollinate, making it well adapted to its harsh native habitat."
