It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a silvery, powdery coating, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including China, Japan, and the Philippines. Gymnogramma argentea typically grows as a small, epiphytic or terrestrial fern, with rhizomes that help anchor it to trees or soil.
