    "intro": "Gomphocarpus rostratus, commonly known as the yellow woodlot, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal regions and sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
