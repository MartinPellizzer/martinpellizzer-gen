It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of vibrant pink or red bracts that resemble small flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by colorful, papery bracts, which are often the main ornamental feature. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and hanging baskets. Gomphrena volubilis is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
