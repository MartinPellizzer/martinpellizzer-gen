    "intro": "Glycine lyallii, commonly known as the Lyall's soybean, is a climbing legume native to New Zealand. It features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is characterized by its slender, twining stems and is often found in forest margins and along stream banks. Glycine lyallii is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility. However, it is considered a weed in some areas due to its invasive growth habits."
