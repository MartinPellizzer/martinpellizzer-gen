    "intro": "Gmelina arborea var. glaucescens, commonly known as the glossy ash or glaucous gmelina, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and lance-shaped, glossy green leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its fast growth and hardiness, it is valued for timber and as a shade tree in agroforestry systems."
