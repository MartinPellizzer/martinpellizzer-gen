    "intro": "Galarhoeus borodinii, commonly known as the Borodin's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pale purple flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and the challenges it poses for cultivation. Due to habitat destruction and climate change, Galarhoeus borodinii is considered critically endangered."
