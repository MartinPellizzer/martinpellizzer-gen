    "intro": "Gluta laosensis, commonly known as the Laos gluta, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Laos and Vietnam, where it grows in tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It is often found in lowland and hill forest areas, thriving in humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
