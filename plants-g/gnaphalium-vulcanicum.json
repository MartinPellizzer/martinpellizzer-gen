    "intro": "Gnaphalium vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic groundsel, is a flowering plant native to volcanic regions, particularly in New Zealand. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers and is often found in coastal and alpine environments. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a profusion of yellowish-white blooms. Gnaphalium vulcanicum is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in harsh, windy conditions."
