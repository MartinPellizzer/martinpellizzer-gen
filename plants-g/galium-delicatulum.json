    "intro": "Galium delicatulum, commonly known as slender bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, helping to stabilize soil in moist, shaded environments. Galium delicatulum is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
