    "intro": "Gossypium ellenbeckii, commonly known as the Ellenbeck cotton, is a rare and endangered species of wild cotton native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, fluffy cotton-like fibers that develop in its flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, arid environments and has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features include alternate leaves with a serrated edge and showy, pinkish-white flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of significant interest for conservation and genetic research."
