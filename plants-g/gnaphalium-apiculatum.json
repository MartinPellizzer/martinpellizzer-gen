    "intro": "Gnaphalium apiculatum, commonly known as the woolly cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense, white to grayish-white hairs covering its stems and leaves, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow disc florets surrounded by pale pink to white ray florets. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along roadsides. Gnaphalium apiculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
