    "intro": "Goniophlebium pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rock faces or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Goniophlebium pringlei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
