    "intro": "Ginkgo biloba f. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright ginkgo, is a unique cultivar characterized by its narrow, columnar growth habit. It features fan-shaped leaves that are typically darker green and more elongated compared to the standard ginkgo. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the fall, and produces distinctive, foul-smelling seeds in the autumn. It is well-suited for small spaces due to its compact form and is often used as a street tree or ornamental plant. The botanical characteristics of this variety make it a popular choice for urban landscaping."
