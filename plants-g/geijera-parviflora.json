    "intro": "Geijera parviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geijera, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of southeastern Australia. Geijera parviflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping."
