    "intro": "Geranium elatum, commonly known as the spreading geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Geranium elatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
