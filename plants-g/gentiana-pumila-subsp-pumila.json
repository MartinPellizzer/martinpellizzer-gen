    "intro": "Gentiana pumila subsp. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers during the summer months. Its flowers are tubular with five lobes, and they bloom in clusters at the end of the stems. This subspecies is notable for its compact size and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
