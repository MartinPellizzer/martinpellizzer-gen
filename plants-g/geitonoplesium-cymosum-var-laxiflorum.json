    "intro": "Geitonoplesium cymosum var. laxiflorum, commonly known as the slender-flowered starfruit, is a climbing shrub native to tropical Australia. It produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, giving it its scientific name. The plant is characterized by its thin, elongated leaves and is often found in open woodlands and coastal areas. Its fruits are typically small and sour, though they are not commonly consumed by humans. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
