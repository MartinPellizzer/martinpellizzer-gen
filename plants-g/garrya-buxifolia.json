    "intro": "Garrya buxifolia, commonly known as the wax myrtle or coastal wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Garrya buxifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate salt spray and wet conditions."
