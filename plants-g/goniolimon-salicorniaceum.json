    "intro": "Goniolimon salicorniaceum, commonly known as the salt marsh plant, is a member of the Amaranthaceae family. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as coastal marshes and tidal flats. The plant has succulent, fleshy stems that store water and salt, allowing it to survive in high-salinity conditions. Its small, scale-like leaves reduce water loss through transpiration. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in coastal areas."
