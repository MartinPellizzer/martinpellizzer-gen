    "intro": "Goeppertia gymnocarpa, commonly known as the rock cycad, is a species of cycad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It produces small, spore-bearing cones rather than flowers, typical of its ancient lineage. Due to its unique appearance and rarity, it is a sought-after specimen in botanical collections."
