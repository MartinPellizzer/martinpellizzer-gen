    "intro": "Galearia lindlaeana, commonly known as the Lindley's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a delicate, scrambling growth habit with long, slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is essential for its survival. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Galearia lindlaeana is considered critically endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
