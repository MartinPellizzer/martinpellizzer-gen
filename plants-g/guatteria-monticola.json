It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible berries that are red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
