    "intro": "Galium wrightii var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf woodypine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically broader than those of the typical variety, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland edges and stream banks."
