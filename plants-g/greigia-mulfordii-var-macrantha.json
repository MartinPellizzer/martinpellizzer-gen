    "intro": "Greigia mulfordii var. macrantha, commonly known as the Florida flame flower, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Florida Keys and is characterized by its vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in coastal environments and is often found in sandy soils near the shore. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
