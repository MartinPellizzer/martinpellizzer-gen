    "intro": "Garrya mollis, commonly known as silverleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, arching branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds. Garrya mollis thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
