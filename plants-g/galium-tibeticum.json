    "intro": "Galium tibeticum, commonly known as Tibetan bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, sprawling stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Galium tibeticum is often found in alpine meadows and is a component of the unique flora of the Tibetan Plateau."
