    "intro": "Gastrochilus formosanus, commonly known as the Formosan stomach orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, including pink, white, and purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on forest floors or among moss-covered rocks. Its morphology includes a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs and linear leaves, and it produces intricate, spurred flowers that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
