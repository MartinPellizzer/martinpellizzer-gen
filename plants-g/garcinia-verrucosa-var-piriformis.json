It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruit that resembles a horn, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers and has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in humid environments. Its fruit, while not widely consumed, contains bioactive compounds that have been studied for their potential health benefits. The plant thrives in lowland rainforests and requires a warm, moist climate for optimal growth."
