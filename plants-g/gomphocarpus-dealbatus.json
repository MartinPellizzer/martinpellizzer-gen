    "intro": "Gomphocarpus dealbatus, commonly known as the silverleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and contains milky sap, which is toxic to some animals. This species is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
