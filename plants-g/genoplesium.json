    "intro": "Genoplesium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of flowering plants native to Australia. These plants are characterized by their unique, often pale or translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Genoplesium species typically grow as terrestrial or epiphytic herbs, with strap-like leaves and highly specialized pollination mechanisms. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, many species are considered endangered."
