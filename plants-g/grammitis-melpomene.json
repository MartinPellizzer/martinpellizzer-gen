    "intro": "Grammitis melpomene, commonly known as the red fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with a striking red or orange coloration on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Grammitis melpomene is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
