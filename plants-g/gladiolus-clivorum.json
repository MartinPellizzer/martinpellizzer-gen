    "intro": "Gladiolus clivorum, commonly known as the alpine gladiolus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing vibrant purple or white petals that attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates, often growing at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
