    "intro": "Gentiana sierrae, commonly known as Sierra gentian, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as meadows and forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often branched. Gentiana sierrae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude habitats."
