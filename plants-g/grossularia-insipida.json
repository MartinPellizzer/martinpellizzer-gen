    "intro": "Grossularia insipida, commonly known as the white gooseberry, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible, yellow to orange berries that are typically less tart than other gooseberry varieties. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
