    "intro": "Gymnogramma jimenezii, commonly known as the Jimenez's gymnogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Gymnogramma jimenezii is native to parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates."
