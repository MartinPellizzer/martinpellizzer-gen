    "intro": "Gentiana viatrix, commonly known as the Alpine gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a silvery or hairy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Gentiana viatrix is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
