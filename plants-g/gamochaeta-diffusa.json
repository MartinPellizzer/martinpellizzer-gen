It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across various environments. Gamochaeta diffusa is often found in regions with temperate climates and is relatively drought-tolerant."
