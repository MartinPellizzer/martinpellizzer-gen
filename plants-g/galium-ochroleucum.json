    "intro": "Galium ochroleucum, commonly known as white wood-sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branched stems that often lie close to the ground, covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Galium ochroleucum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
