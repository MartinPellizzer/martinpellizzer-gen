    "intro": "Glicophyllum rhodopteron, commonly known as the red-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that display a striking contrast of light green and deep red veins. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is short and creeping, with numerous adventitious roots that help anchor it in soil. The spores are produced in small, rounded sori located on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns."
