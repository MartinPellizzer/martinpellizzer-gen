    "intro": "Glyceria plicata var. triticea, commonly known as the narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats. Its presence can indicate the health of wetland ecosystems due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
