    "intro": "Galarhoeus inderiensis, commonly known as the Inderien spike moss, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. This plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are cone-like and contain spores. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
