    "intro": "Gonatopus rhizomatosus, commonly known as the zigzag spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, slender stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinct zigzag pattern along the midrib. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a valuable groundcover in moist, shaded habitats. The plant is also notable for its ability to thrive in wetland environments, contributing to soil stabilization and ecological diversity."
