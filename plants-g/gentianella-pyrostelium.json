    "intro": "Gentianella pyrostelium, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and North America. It typically grows in rocky, moist habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its flowers are striking, with vivid blue or violet petals that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Gentianella pyrostelium is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
