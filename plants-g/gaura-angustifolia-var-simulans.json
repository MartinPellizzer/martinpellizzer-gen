It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers resembling candle flames. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often growing in open woodland or prairie habitats.
