    "intro": "Gerardia setacea, commonly known as the hairy gerardia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Gerardia setacea is typically found in rocky soils and open habitats, showcasing its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
