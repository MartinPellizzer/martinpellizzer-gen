    "intro": "Grammitis ascensionis, commonly known as Ascension Island fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on Ascension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, evergreen foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its small, clustered sporangia are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human activity."
