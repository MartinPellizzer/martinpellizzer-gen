    "intro": "Glycine pentandra, commonly known as the climbing peanut or wild peanut, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pods containing edible seeds, which are similar in appearance to peanuts but are not typically consumed by humans. Glycine pentandra has a climbing habit and often grows along fences or in shaded areas. It plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
