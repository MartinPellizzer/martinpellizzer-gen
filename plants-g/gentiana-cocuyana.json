    "intro": "Gentiana cocuyana, commonly known as the Cocuyan gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gentiana cocuyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
