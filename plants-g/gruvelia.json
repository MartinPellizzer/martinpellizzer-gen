    "intro": "Gruvelia, commonly known as the rock fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it typically grows in rocky or coastal environments. The plants are characterized by their succulent leaves and small, fig-like fruits that are often edible. Gruvelia species are usually shrubs or small trees, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 3 meters. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, arid conditions."
