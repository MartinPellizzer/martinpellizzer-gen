    "intro": "Guettardella edanoi, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in some regions."
