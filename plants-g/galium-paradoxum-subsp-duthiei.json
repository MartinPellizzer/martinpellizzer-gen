    "intro": "Galium paradoxum subsp. duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It features slender, ascending stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are opposite, simple, and usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its botanical characteristics are adapted to the cool, moist environments of its alpine habitat. Galium paradoxum subsp. duthiei is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution."
