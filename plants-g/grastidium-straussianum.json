    "intro": "Grastidium straussianum, commonly known as the Strasbourg orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale violet flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Grastidium straussianum is now listed as an endangered species."
