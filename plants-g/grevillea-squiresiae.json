    "intro": "Grevillea squiresiae, commonly known as the Squires' waratah, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers, which are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences resembling a crown. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically grey-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its bold floral displays. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural range, it is considered a rare and valuable species in horticulture."
