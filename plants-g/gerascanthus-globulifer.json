    "intro": "Gerascanthus globulifer, commonly known as the globe-fruit plant, is a unique species belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its spherical, fleshy fruits that resemble small globes, which are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or orange upon maturity. The plant has a climbing habit and features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces a distinctive, aromatic scent to attract pollinators. The fruit is edible and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
