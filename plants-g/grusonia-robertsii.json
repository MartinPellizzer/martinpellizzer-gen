    "intro": "Grusonia robertsii, commonly known as the Roberts' ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with elongated, pale green leaves and a single, delicate white or pale pink flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires specific humidity and light conditions to thrive, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Grusonia robertsii is considered a conservation concern."
