    "intro": "Gleichenia elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that are often covered with a dense layer of fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Gleichenia elmeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
