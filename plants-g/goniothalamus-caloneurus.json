    "intro": "Goniothalamus caloneurus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed talaud, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a subtle fragrance. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds, contributing to its ecological role in forest regeneration. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
