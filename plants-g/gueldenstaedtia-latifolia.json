    "intro": "Gueldenstaedtia latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf vetch, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets, and its flowers are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense spikes. The plant produces small, lens-shaped legumes as fruits, which contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Gueldenstaedtia latifolia is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
