    "intro": "Gladiolus aphyllus, commonly known as the leafless gladiolus, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to southern Africa. This plant is characterized by its absence of true leaves, with only a few narrow, grass-like leaf sheaths emerging from the base. Its most notable feature is its tall, erect stem that bears a single, showy, trumpet-shaped flower at the top. The flower typically comes in shades of white, pink, or red, with a distinctive three-lobed petal structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
