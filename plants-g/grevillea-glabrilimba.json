    "intro": "Grevillea glabrilimba, commonly known as the silky grevillea, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces striking, red or orange inflorescences that consist of numerous small, tubular flowers clustered together. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Grevillea glabrilimba is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract native pollinators such as honeyeaters and bees."
