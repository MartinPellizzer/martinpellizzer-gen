It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its opposite leaf arrangement and showy blossoms make it a distinctive member of the gentian family, Gentianaceae. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
