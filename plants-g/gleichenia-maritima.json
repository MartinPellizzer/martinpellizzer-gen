    "intro": "Gleichenia maritima, commonly known as the sea gleichenia, is a fern species native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in salt marshes and dune environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds. Gleichenia maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
