    "intro": "Goniopteris deltata, commonly known as the broad-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that are typically divided into broad, deltoid-shaped lobes. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Goniopteris deltata plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen."
