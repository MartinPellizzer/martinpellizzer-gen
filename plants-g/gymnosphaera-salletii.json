    "intro": "Gymnosphaera salletii, commonly known as the African sand dollar, is a unique succulent native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae and is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and fleshy, greenish-gray leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by distinctive, spiky seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for arid environments. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in rock gardens and containers."
