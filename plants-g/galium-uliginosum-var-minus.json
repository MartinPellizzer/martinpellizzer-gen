    "intro": "Galium uliginosum var. minus, commonly known as lesser bladdercamp, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are typically hairy and adapted to moist environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a bladder-like capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. This variety is often found in marshes, swamps, and other damp, shaded areas where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils."
