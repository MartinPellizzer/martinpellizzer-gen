    "intro": "Gaultheria nummularioides var. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic waxleaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features dense, elliptical-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover."
