    "intro": "Gandasulium gomezianum, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the cloud forests of northern South America. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several regions."
