    "intro": "Geissorhiza hirta var. quinquangularis, commonly known as the five-angled geissorhiza, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, and it produces showy, fragrant blooms during the summer months. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
