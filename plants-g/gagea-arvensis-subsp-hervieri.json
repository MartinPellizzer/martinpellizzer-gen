    "intro": "Gagea arvensis subsp. hervieri, commonly known as the Hervier's spring beauty, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are basal, grass-like, and often covered in fine hairs. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different floral morphology and geographic distribution compared to the typical form of Gagea arvensis."
