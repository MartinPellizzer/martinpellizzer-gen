    "intro": "Gagea angrenica, commonly known as the Angrenica spring beauty, is a small perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescence of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, grass-like, and often withering by the time the flowers bloom. Gagea angrenica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
