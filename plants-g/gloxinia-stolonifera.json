    "intro": "Gloxinia stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping gloxinia, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant produces stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gloxinia stolonifera is often cultivated as a decorative plant for indoor gardens and tropical landscapes."
