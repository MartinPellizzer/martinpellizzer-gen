It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. It blooms in early spring and is adapted to temperate climates with well-drained soils.
