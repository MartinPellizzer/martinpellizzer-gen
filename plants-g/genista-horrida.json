It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by narrow, bean-like pods containing seeds. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, rounded leaflets, and the plant is often covered in fine, bristly hairs. Genista horrida is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and Mediterranean regions."
