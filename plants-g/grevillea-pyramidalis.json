    "intro": "Grevillea pyramidalis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed waratah, is a striking evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves and is renowned for its showy, red or pink, fluffy flower spikes that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens. Its unique floral structure attracts nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to local biodiversity. Grevillea pyramidalis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and visual impact."
