    "intro": "Goodyera afzelii, commonly known as the silver waxy plant, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, with petals that are often adorned with intricate markings. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky areas, and is often found growing on tree trunks or among leaf litter. Goodyera afzelii is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native ecosystems."
