    "intro": "Gymnogramma obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Gymnogramma obtusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
