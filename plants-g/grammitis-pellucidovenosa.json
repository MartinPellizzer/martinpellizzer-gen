    "intro": "Grammitis pellucidovenosa, commonly known as the translucent-veined fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant's leaves are typically small, with a glossy surface and prominent, translucent veins that give it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
