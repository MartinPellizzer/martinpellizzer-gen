    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza undulata, commonly known as the wavy licorice, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Glycyrrhiza undulata is valued for its roots, which are rich in glycyrrhizin, a compound used in traditional medicine and as a sweetener. Its ecological role includes nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in its native habitat."
