    "intro": "Gymnopodium ovatifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gymnopodium, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Central America. It features simple, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing sandy soils."
