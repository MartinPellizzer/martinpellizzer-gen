    "intro": "Genista tamarrutii, commonly known as the Moroccan broom, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically small and compound, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Genista tamarrutii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife in its native range."
