    "intro": "Grammitis diversifolia, commonly known as the variable fernlet, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often divided into numerous small, triangular lobes. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Grammitis diversifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings due to its specific humidity and light requirements."
