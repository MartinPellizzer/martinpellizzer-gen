    "intro": "Gentianella crispata, commonly known as the crinkled gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are usually crinkled or wavy, giving it its common name, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Gentianella crispata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant flowers."
