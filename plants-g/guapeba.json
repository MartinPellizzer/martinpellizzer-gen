    "intro": "Guapeba, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the genus Dalbergia and is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, reddish-brown color. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a legume pod containing flattened, brown seeds. Due to its high value for wood, the guapeba is also considered an endangered species."
