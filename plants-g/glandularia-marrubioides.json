    "intro": "Glandularia marrubioides, commonly known as the sticky verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky resin, which helps deter herbivores and retain moisture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in arid environments. Its unique botanical features make it a valuable addition to xeriscaped gardens and ecological restoration projects."
