    "intro": "Glyceria triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered glyceria, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, pond margins, and stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear three flowers, giving it its common name. Glyceria triflora is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
