    "intro": "Grammatophyllum rumphianum, commonly known as the giant spathephyllum, is a striking member of the Araceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a broad, colorful spathe. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial species, often found in humid tropical forests. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth surface and prominent veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into berries, contributing to its ecological role in seed dispersal."
