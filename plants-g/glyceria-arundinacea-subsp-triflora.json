    "intro": "Glyceria arundinacea subsp. triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear three to five florets, giving it its subspecific name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Glyceria arundinacea subsp. triflora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
