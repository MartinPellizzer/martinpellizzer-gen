    "intro": "Grevillea saxicola, commonly known as the rock grevillea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, grass-like leaves and bright red or orange flowers that appear in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing on rocky outcrops or sandy soils. Its unique floral structure attracts nectar-feeding birds and insects, making it an important component of local ecosystems. Grevillea saxicola is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
