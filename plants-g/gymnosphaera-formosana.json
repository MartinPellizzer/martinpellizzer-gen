    "intro": "Gymnosphaera formosana, commonly known as the Formosan cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of gymnosperms. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
