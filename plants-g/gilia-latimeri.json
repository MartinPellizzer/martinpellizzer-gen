    "intro": "Gilia latimeri, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Gilia latimeri is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in disturbed or sandy habitats."
