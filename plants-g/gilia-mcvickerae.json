    "intro": "Gilia mcvickerae, commonly known as the McVickerae's gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant is an annual herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and branched. Gilia mcvickerae plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
