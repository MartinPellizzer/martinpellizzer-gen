    "intro": "Gymnogramma decurrenti-alata, commonly known as the spreading decurrent gymnogramma, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that often have a creeping or trailing growth habit. The plant typically features small, ovate to lanceolate pinnae with a distinct, often recurved margin. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, shaded environments. Gymnogramma decurrenti-alata is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in humid, shaded forest understories."
