    "intro": "Glycine biloba, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and clusters of fragrant, purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with a feathery appearance, and its seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like fruits. Glycine biloba is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not properly managed."
