    "intro": "Gonosuke, commonly known as the Japanese cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Japan. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of gymnosperms. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, adding to its ornamental value. Gonosuke is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and resilience to urban conditions."
