    "intro": "Glechoma isaurica, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Glechoma isaurica thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain settings."
