    "intro": "Gypsophila osmangaziensis, commonly known as the Osmaniya snowball, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its fluffy, white or pale pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid climates. It produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
