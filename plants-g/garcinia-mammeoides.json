    "intro": "Garcinia mammeoides, commonly known as the African mango or butter fruit, is a tropical plant native to Central and West Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits that contain a single large seed. The fruit's outer pulp is rich in nutrients, while the inner part contains the seed, which is often used in traditional medicine. Garcinia mammeoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential health benefits."
