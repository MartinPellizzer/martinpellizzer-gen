    "intro": "Goniophlebium cardiophyllum, commonly known as the heartleaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped fronds, which are typically bright green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
