    "intro": "Guazuma invira, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or wild cherry, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The tree produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by birds and mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. Its bark is thick and rugged, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Guazuma invira thrives in humid, shaded environments and is commonly found in rainforests and secondary growth areas."
