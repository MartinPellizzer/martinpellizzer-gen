    "intro": "Gastrodia hasseltii, commonly known as the African ginseng, is a parasitic plant belonging to the orchid family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of trees or shrubs. The plant produces a unique, tubular structure called a pseudobulb, which stores nutrients and water. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its rarity and medicinal properties, it is often cultivated for its potential health benefits."
