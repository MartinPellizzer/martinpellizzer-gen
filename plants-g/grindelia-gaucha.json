    "intro": "Grindelia gaucha, commonly known as desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves and yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions. Its resinous sap has been used by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Grindelia gaucha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes."
