    "intro": "Gnaphalium semipapposum, commonly known as the silverleaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are surrounded by fine, hairy bracts, giving it a fluffy appearance. Its leaves are silver-gray, covered in dense, fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gnaphalium semipapposum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
