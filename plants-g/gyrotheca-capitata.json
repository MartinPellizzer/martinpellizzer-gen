    "intro": "Gyrotheca capitata, commonly known as the helmeted corymbia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, textured surface, typical of many Myrtaceae species. Gyrotheca capitata is often found in dry, sclerophyllous forests and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
