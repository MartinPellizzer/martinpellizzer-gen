    "intro": "Gleichenia nervosa var. lobatocrenata, commonly known as the broad-crenate maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are often covered in a dense, silvery-white layer of trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and spore-bearing sporangia. This variety is notable for its distinctive leaf shape and is often found in temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere."
