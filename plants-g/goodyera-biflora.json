    "intro": "Goodyera biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered maidenhair, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Goodyera biflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
