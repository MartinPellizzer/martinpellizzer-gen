    "intro": "Galium boreale subsp. hyssopifolium, commonly known as the northern bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are followed by small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Galium boreale subsp. hyssopifolium is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, bogs, and rocky areas."
