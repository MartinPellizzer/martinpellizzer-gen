    "intro": "Gastrodia ovata, commonly known as the Chinese club-moss or the thunder god's orchid, is a unique orchid species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, club-shaped rhizome and lack of true leaves, relying instead on its underground structures for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Gastrodia ovata is often cultivated for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional Chinese medicine. Its growth is slow and it requires specific environmental conditions to thrive."
