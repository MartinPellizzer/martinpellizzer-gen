    "intro": "Gaultheria serrata var. serrata, commonly known as the serrated wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the southern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are serrated along the edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and wildlife. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
