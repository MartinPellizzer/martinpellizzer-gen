    "intro": "Gymnogramma caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant has a delicate, creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lanceolate, serrated leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive linear pattern. Gymnogramma caudata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
