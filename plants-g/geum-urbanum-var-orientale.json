    "intro": "Geum urbanum var. orientale, commonly known as the Eastern garden sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features upright, branched stems that bear palmately divided, trifoliate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, petal-less flowers that bloom in early summer. Its foliage has a mild, tangy flavor, making it edible and sometimes used in salads or as a seasoning. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade."
