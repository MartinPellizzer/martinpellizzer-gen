    "intro": "Gaultheria \u00d7 serrulata, commonly known as the creeping wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide ground cover in woodland gardens."
