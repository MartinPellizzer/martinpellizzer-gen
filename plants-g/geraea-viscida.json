    "intro": "Geraea viscida, commonly known as the sticky geranium, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps in deterring herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Geraea viscida is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
