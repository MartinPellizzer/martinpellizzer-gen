    "intro": "Glyphochloa bombaiensis, commonly known as the Bombay grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
