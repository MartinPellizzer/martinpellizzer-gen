    "intro": "Genista aphylla, commonly known as the leafless broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
