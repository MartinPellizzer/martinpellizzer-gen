    "intro": "Gomphocarpus rubioides, commonly known as the red-stemmed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap, which is toxic, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Gomphocarpus rubioides is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils."
