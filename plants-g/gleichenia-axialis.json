    "intro": "Gleichenia axialis, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its robust, creeping rhizomes and large, pinnately compound fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. Gleichenia axialis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a common and recognizable species in temperate regions."
