    "intro": "Gavilea litoralis, commonly known as the coastal gavilea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in the salty, windy coastal environment. Gavilea litoralis is often found in association with other halophytic plants, thriving in the unique ecological conditions of the coast."
