    "intro": "Gymnogramma rutifolia, commonly known as the golden-backed spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of white or golden hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Gymnogramma rutifolia is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates."
