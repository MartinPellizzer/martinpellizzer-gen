    "intro": "Glechoma cryptantha, commonly known as the creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, blue or violet flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its stolons, which allow it to spread horizontally along the ground, forming dense mats. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Glechoma cryptantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to prevent soil erosion."
