    "intro": "Gyroptera, commonly known as the golden club, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants like peace lilies and calla lilies. The plant features a short, stout rhizome with broad, waxy, arrow-shaped leaves that are often a deep green color. Its most distinctive feature is the spadix, a dense cluster of tiny flowers surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Gyroptera is often found in wetlands and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils."
