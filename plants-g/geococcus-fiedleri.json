    "intro": "Geococcus fiedleri, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and are typically borne on tall, erect stems. The plant has a short, thick root system that helps it survive in dry conditions, and its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures. Geococcus fiedleri is a perennial species that thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh desert environments."
