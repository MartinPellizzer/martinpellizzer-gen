It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow, spurred flowers. The subspecies hirsutum is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a rough texture. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its spread in suitable habitats."
