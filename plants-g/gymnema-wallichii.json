    "intro": "Gymnema wallichii, commonly known as the Indian gymnema, is a climbing shrub native to the forests of India and Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its unique ability to inhibit the perception of sweetness, a property attributed to the presence of gymnemic acids. It is often cultivated for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability make it a common component of tropical understory vegetation."
