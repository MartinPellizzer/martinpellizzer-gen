    "intro": "Glycine \u00d7 gracilis var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf climbing bean, is a compact variety of the genus Glycine, characterized by its short stature and vigorous climbing habit. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, pale green pods that contain edible seeds. The plant thrives in warm climates and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of protein-rich legumes. Its botanical classification highlights its hybrid origin, combining traits from both Glycine max and Glycine tomentosa."
