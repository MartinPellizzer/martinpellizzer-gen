    "intro": "Gordonia integerrima, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States and northern parts of South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its humid, coastal environment. Gordonia integerrima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
