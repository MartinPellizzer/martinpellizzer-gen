    "intro": "Gerardia serpyllifolia, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern to conserve moisture. Gerardia serpyllifolia is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in challenging habitats."
