    "intro": "Globularia aphyllanthes, commonly known as the leafless globularia, is a small, flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and lack of true leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its fleshy, scale-like structures. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid climates as an ornamental plant."
