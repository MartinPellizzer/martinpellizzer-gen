    "intro": "Guapira floridana, commonly known as the Florida guapira, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 3 to 5 feet and features glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Guapira floridana is often found in moist, acidic soils in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
