    "intro": "Gymnopteris irregularis, commonly known as the irregular fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped fronds that are typically bipinnate or tripinnate. The plant is native to regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are typically covered by a protective indusium. Gymnopteris irregularis is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
