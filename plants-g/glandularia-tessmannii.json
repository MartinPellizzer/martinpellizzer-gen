    "intro": "Glandularia tessmannii, commonly known as the coastal bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its blue to purple flowers and glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and strong winds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
