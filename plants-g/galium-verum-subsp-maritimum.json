    "intro": "Galium verum subsp. maritimum, commonly known as lesser bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in maritime environments. Due to its delicate structure and preference for coastal habitats, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
