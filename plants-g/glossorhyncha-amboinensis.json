    "intro": "Glossorhyncha amboinensis, commonly known as the Amboina orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Maluku Islands of Indonesia. It features a short, stocky rhizome and produces a single, narrow spike of small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant has broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hair. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
