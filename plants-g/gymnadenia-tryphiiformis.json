    "intro": "Gymnadenia tryphiiformis, commonly known as the Tryphylia orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or heathland environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, elongated spike of flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
