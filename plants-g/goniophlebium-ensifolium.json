    "intro": "Goniophlebium ensifolium, commonly known as the swordleaf fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forests. Its rhizome system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clusters. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, elegant appearance."
