    "intro": "Galactia multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Galactia multiflora has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
