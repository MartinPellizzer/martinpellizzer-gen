    "intro": "Geocharis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are known for their striking, often bioluminescent flowers. The flowers typically open at night and emit a faint glow, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Geocharis species are generally small shrubs with tubular or funnel-shaped petals. They are valued in horticulture for their unique appearance and ecological significance in their native habitats."
