    "intro": "Gossypium barbadense subsp. microcarpum, commonly known as the\u6d77\u5c9b\u68c9 or sea island cotton, is a rare and ancient species of cotton native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its fine, long staple fibers, which are prized for their strength and softness. The plant produces small, round bolls that contain the cotton fibers, which are harvested manually due to the plant's low yield. It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soils and requires a long growing season. Due to its limited cultivation and genetic uniqueness, it holds significant value in botanical and agricultural research."
