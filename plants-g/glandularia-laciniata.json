    "intro": "Glandularia laciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved glandularia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Glandularia laciniata is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
