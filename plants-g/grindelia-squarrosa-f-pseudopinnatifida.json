    "intro": "Grindelia squarrosa f. pseudopinnatifida, commonly known as the desert gumweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features grayish-green, fuzzy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow and produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Grindelia squarrosa."
