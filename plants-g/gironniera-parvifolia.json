    "intro": "Gironniera parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved ironwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for erosion control and wildlife habitat. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions."
