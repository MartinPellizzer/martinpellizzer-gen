    "intro": "Gilbertiodendron robynsianum, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The tree produces pods that contain small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in savanna and woodland habitats, and its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
