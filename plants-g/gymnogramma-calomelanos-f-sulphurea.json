    "intro": "Gymnogramma calomelanos f. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur fern, is a variant of the gymnogramma genus within the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow to golden fronds, which give it its distinctive appearance. Its leaves are pinnately divided and often have a waxy coating, which helps in retaining moisture. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
