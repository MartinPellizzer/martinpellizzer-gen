    "intro": "Gnetum latifolium var. minus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gnetum, is a rare and unique gymnosperm native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, evergreen leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are unisexual, with separate male and female structures. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, three-lobed aril, which is an unusual feature among gymnosperms. This variant is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance."
