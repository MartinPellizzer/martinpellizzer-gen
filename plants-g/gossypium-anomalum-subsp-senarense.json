    "intro": "Gossypium anomalum subsp. senarense, commonly known as the Senarien cotton, is a lesser-known species within the cotton genus native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy stems, typical of many cotton species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by fluffy bolls containing the fibrous seed cotton. Its fibres are generally shorter and coarser compared to those of commercially cultivated cotton species. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
