    "intro": "Galium sylvestre var. montanum, commonly known as mountain wood-sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, ascending stems that are often reddish in color and bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. It is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
