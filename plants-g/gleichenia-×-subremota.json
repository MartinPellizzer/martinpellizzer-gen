    "intro": "Gleichenia \u00d7 subremota, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Gleichenia trichocarpa and Gleichenia mirabilis. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates such as soil or rock. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically found in the wild and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
