    "intro": "Glomera sandaveri, commonly known as the Sandaver's glomera, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth habit and small, delicate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
