    "intro": "Goniopteris stephanii, commonly known as the Stephen's moonwort, is a fern species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that resemble the shape of a moon, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Goniopteris stephanii is valued for its ornamental appearance and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
