    "intro": "Guenthera amplexicaulis subsp. souliei, commonly known as the Souchong orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves that often wrap around the stems, giving it its species name \"amplexicaulis,\" meaning \"embracing stem.\" The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, making it a challenging but rewarding species for cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
