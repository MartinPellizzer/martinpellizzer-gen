    "intro": "Grammitis sumatrana, commonly known as Sumatran filmy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are thin and translucent, with a unique structure that allows for efficient water retention. Grammitis sumatrana is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the islands of Sumatra and Borneo."
