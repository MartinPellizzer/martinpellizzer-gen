    "intro": "Genista lydia var. antiochia, commonly known as the Antioch broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers in early spring, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white to grayish pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is closely related to other species in the Genista genus, which are known for their ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
