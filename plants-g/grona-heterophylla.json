    "intro": "Grona heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf grona, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, often heterophyllous leaves that vary in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, where it thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pale purple. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, Grona heterophylla is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
