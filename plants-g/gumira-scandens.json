    "intro": "Gumira scandens, commonly known as the climbing gumira, is a woody vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to climb using adventitious roots that attach to supporting structures. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Gumira scandens is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
