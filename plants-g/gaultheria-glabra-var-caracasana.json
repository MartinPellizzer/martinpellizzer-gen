    "intro": "Gaultheria glabra var. caracasana, commonly known as the Caracasane wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Andes mountains. It features small, dark green leaves that are glossy and elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, edible berries. These berries contain aromatic oils and are used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes."
