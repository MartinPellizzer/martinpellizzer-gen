    "intro": "Gentiana verna var. willkommiana, commonly known as the spring gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stem is erect and bears the showy flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
