    "intro": "Gorgonidium vermicidum, commonly known as the snakehead plant, is a unique species belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that resembles a snake's head, hence its common name. The plant produces a toxic sap that can cause skin irritation and is used in traditional medicine in some regions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. Due to its toxicity, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant rather than for medicinal use."
