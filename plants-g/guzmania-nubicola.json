    "intro": "Guzmania nubicola, commonly known as the cloud forest bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the canopy. Its foliage forms a rosette that collects rainwater, creating a micro-ecosystem supporting small aquatic organisms. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to purify air in indoor settings."
