    "intro": "Geranium pissjaukovae, commonly known as the Pissjaukove geranium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing vibrant pink or purple hues. Its leaves are usually palmately lobed, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
