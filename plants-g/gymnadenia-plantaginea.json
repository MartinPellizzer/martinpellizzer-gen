    "intro": "Gymnadenia plantaginea, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, erect, spike-like inflorescence bearing small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, calcareous grasslands and meadows across Europe. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Gymnadenia plantaginea is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its ecological importance as a food source for certain pollinators."
