    "intro": "Glyceria maritima var. deflexa, commonly known as the coastal glyceria, is a variant of the common glyceria, native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a perennial grass-like plant that thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its growth habit is typically low and dense, forming mats that help stabilize coastal soils. This variety is adapted to withstand salt spray and fluctuating water levels, making it an important component of salt marsh ecosystems."
