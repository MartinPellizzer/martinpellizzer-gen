    "intro": "Genoplesium fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed piper, is an orchid species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and undergrowth. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The orchid's unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native range."
