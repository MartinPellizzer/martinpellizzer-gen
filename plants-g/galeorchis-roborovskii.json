    "intro": "Galeorchis roborovskii, commonly known as the Roborovskii galeorchis, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. It has a unique symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
