    "intro": "Govenia andrieuxii, commonly known as the Andrieux's honeysuckle, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in the understory of humid tropical rainforests. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and woody. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Govenia andrieuxii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
