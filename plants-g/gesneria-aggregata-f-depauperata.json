    "intro": "Gesneria aggregata f. depauperata, commonly known as the sparse-leaved gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features small, elongated leaves that are often densely packed, giving it a lush, foliage-heavy appearance. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which are typically borne on terminal inflorescences. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
