    "intro": "Gustavia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is often found in mangrove ecosystems. Its flowers bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Gustavia latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, saline environments."
