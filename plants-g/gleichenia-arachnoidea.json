    "intro": "Gleichenia arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its long, strap-like fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. Gleichenia arachnoidea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique foliage."
