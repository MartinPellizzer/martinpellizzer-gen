    "intro": "Gastrodia similis, commonly known as the similar ginseng, is a rare and elusive orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous roots and its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its underground structures for photosynthesis. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing in dense forests. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-yellow, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Gastrodia similis is highly valued in traditional medicine and is often protected in conservation efforts."
