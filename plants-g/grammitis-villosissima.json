    "intro": "Grammitis villosissima, commonly known as the silky fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, thriving in high humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its host, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis villosissima is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
