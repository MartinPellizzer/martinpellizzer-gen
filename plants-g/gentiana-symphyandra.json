    "intro": "Gentiana symphyandra, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and Pyrenees. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer, and its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Gentiana symphyandra is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
