    "intro": "Grindelia nana var. discoidea, commonly known as the dwarf gumweed, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species suitable for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
