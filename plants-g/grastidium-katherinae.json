    "intro": "Grastidium katherinae, commonly known as the Katherine's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a ghostly silhouette. This species belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism involving specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare botanical treasure from habitat loss and over-collection."
