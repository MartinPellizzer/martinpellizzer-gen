    "intro": "Gaultheria depressa var. novae-zealandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like form. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries in autumn. These berries are edible and have a tart, cranberry-like flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
