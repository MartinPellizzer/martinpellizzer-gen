    "intro": "Geum resinosum, commonly known as sticky geranium, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features upright stems that are often covered in a sticky resin, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. Geum resinosum is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
