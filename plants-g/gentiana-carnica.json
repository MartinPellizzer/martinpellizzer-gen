    "intro": "Gentiana carnica, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Gentiana carnica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
