    "intro": "Gnetum ridleyi, commonly known as the Malayan gnetum, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree belonging to the family Gnetaceae. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often elliptic leaves that are usually entire and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, three-lobed capsule, which is a unique feature among gymnosperms. Gnetum ridleyi is native to Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Myanmar, and Malaysia, and thrives in humid, shaded environments."
