    "intro": "Gloveria, commonly known as the false arum, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their distinctive, often showy inflorescences that resemble a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Gloveria species typically have arrow-shaped leaves and are often grown as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance. They are also sometimes used in traditional medicine, though their botanical properties remain less studied compared to other members of the Araceae family."
