    "intro": "Glyceria fluitans var. acutiflora, commonly known as the sharp-flowered watergrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its flowers are usually greenish or brownish, and it is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
