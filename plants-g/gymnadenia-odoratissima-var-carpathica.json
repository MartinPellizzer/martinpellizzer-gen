    "intro": "Gymnadenia odoratissima var. carpathica, commonly known as the Carpathian lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and a distinctive, fragrant inflorescence composed of small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a spiral. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in forested or open habitats. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate appearance and subtle, sweet fragrance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
