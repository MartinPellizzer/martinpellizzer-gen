    "intro": "Gomphocarpus palustris, commonly known as the marsh milkweed, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Africa. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. Its unique fruit is a spiral-shaped capsule that twists open to release seeds. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife in its native environment."
