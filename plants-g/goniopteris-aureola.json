    "intro": "Goniopteris aureola, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically golden-yellow in color, giving it its common name. The plant has a tall, unbranched trunk that is covered in a thick, fibrous layer of old leaf bases. Its fronds are pinnately divided and can grow up to several meters in length. Goniopteris aureola is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
