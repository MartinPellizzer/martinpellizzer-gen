    "intro": "Gaura villosa subsp. parksii, commonly known as the pink gaura, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, zigzagging stems and clusters of delicate, pink or white flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and native plant gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its airy, ethereal appearance and its ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
