    "intro": "Gleichenia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal Gleichenia, is a fern that thrives in moist, coastal environments. It is characterized by its feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila. It is often found growing on rocks or in sandy soils near the shoreline. Gleichenia littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small organisms."
