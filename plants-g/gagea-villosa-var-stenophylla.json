    "intro": "Gagea villosa var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gagea, is a flowering plant species native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and clustered, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. The flowers, which bloom in late spring, are usually white or pale pink and are pollinated by insects."
