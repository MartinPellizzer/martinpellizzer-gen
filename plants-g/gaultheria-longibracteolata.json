    "intro": "Gaultheria longibracteolata, commonly known as the long-bract wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by edible, red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Gaultheria longibracteolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in traditional medicine."
