    "intro": "Galium parisiense subsp. decipiens, commonly known as the false agrimony, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are often mistaken for true agrimony due to their similar appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive yet often overlooked component of the understory flora."
