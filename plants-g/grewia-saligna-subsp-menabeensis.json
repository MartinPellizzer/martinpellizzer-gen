    "intro": "Grewia saligna subsp. menabeensis, commonly known as the Menabe gum tree, is a shrub or small tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment. The species is of interest for its potential use in local ecosystems and traditional practices."
