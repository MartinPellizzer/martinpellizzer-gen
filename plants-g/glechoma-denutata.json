    "intro": "Glechoma denutata, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant has heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Small, white or pale blue flowers appear in clusters during the spring and early summer. Glechoma denutata is often used in landscaping for its ability to suppress weeds and its ornamental value."
