    "intro": "Galphimia, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. These plants are native to Central and South America, with species such as Galphimia glauca being particularly popular. They are shrubs or small trees that typically have compound leaves and produce vibrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The flowers are often visited by hummingbirds and other pollinators due to their nectar-rich structure. Galphimia species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, sunny climates."
