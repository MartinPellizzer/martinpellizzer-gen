    "intro": "Grewia newtonii, commonly known as the red bush willow, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a hairy texture. Grewia newtonii is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter."
