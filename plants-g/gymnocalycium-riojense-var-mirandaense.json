    "intro": "Gymnocalycium riojense var. mirandaense, commonly known as the Miranda's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Argentina. It is characterized by its spherical or elongated stem, which is typically covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh conditions."
