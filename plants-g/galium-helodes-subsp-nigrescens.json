    "intro": "Galium helodes subsp. nigrescens, commonly known as black-stemmed bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, ascending stems that become dark purple or black with age, giving it its common name. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are borne in clusters and bloom in early summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
