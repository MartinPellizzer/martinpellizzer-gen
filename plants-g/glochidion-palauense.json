    "intro": "Glochidion palauense, commonly known as the Palau hibiscus, is a shrub native to the island of Palau in the western Pacific. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
