    "intro": "Galium fosbergii, commonly known as Fosberg's bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in loose, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium fosbergii is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
