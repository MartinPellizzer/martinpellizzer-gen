    "intro": "Galium axiflorum f. minor, commonly known as the lesser wood-sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, prostrate stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three ovate to lanceolate leaflets, and it prefers moist, shaded environments. This fern-like plant is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
