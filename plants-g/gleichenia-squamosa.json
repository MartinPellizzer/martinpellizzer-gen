    "intro": "Gleichenia squamosa, commonly known as the scalycushion fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are covered in small, scale-like structures. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense mats, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid conditions. Gleichenia squamosa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in maintaining soil moisture and supporting local biodiversity."
