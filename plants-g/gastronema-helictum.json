    "intro": "Gastronema helictum, commonly known as the slender watergrass, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the surface of water, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, which bloom during the wet season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Gastronema helictum plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by reducing water currents and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
