    "intro": "Gnaphalium littorale, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats, with silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish flower heads. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and along shorelines. Its flowers are composed of numerous tiny florets, which are surrounded by bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. Gnaphalium littorale is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
