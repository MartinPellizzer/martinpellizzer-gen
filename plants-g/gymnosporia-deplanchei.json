It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by distinctive, woody fruits that contain seeds. Its botanical features include simple, alternate leaves and a taproot system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Gymnosporia deplanchei plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
