    "intro": "Gastrochilus linearifolius, commonly known as the linear-leaved stomach orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, erect stems and elongated, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
