    "intro": "Gentiana sedifolia f. acaulis, commonly known as the leafless gentian, is a striking plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem that often lacks leaves. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique feature is the absence of leaves along the stem, which is a distinguishing trait of the 'acaulis' form. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh mountain environments."
