    "intro": "Gladiolus gunnisii, commonly known as the Gunns gladiolus, is a rare and striking plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, colorful flowers. The plant typically blooms in summer, producing large, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
