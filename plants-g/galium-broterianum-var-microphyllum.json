    "intro": "Galium broterianum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and slightly hairy, with a delicate, herbaceous texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
