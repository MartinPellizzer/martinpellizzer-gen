    "intro": "Gagea bohemica subsp. saxatilis, commonly known as the Bohemian rock lily, is a perennial bulbous plant native to Central Europe. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, clustered bulbs and is adapted to harsh, well-drained environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
