    "intro": "Galium undulatum, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy, silver-green surface that reflects light, giving it a distinctive appearance. Galium undulatum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
