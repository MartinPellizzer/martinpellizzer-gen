It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in woodland or scrub habitats. It is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
