    "intro": "Gauridium kunthii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its twining stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in the early morning, adapting to the extreme temperatures of its desert habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Gauridium kunthii is often found growing along rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, demonstrating its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
