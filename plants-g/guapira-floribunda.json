    "intro": "Guapira floribunda, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or golden bell tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red, papery fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Guapira floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
