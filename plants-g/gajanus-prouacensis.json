    "intro": "Gajanus prouacensis, commonly known as the African dwarf frog, is a small aquatic frog native to the freshwater habitats of sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the family Pipidae and is characterized by its smooth, moist skin and lack of a tympanum. The plant aspect of this species is not directly relevant, as Gajanus prouacensis is an animal, not a plant. Therefore, there are no botanical features associated with it. If you were referring to a plant, please provide the correct name."
