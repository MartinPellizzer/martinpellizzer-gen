    "intro": "Goniopteris sagittata, commonly known as the arrow fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce upright, compound leaves. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a narrow, linear shape that gives it a delicate, feathery appearance. Goniopteris sagittata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
