It is characterized by its compact, globular stem that is typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It has a dense covering of fine, white hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and water loss. This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
