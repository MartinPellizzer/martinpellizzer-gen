    "intro": "Guarea megaphylla, commonly known as the giant guarea, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. Its bark is thick and often fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Guarea megaphylla is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
