    "intro": "Gyrostachys funckiana, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of Africa. It features slender, branching stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Gyrostachys funckiana is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
