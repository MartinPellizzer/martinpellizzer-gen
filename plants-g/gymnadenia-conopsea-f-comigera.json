The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its botanical features include elongated, strap-like leaves and a unique floral structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
