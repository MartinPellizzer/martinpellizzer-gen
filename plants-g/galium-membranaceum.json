    "intro": "Galium membranaceum, commonly known as slender bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its thin, wiry stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and ability to spread via rhizomes make it a common component of understory vegetation."
