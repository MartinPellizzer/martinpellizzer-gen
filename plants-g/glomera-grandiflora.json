    "intro": "Glomera grandiflora, commonly known as the giant flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, featuring vibrant red and yellow petals. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its moist habitat. Glomera grandiflora is also notable for its association with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which play a crucial role in its nutrient uptake."
