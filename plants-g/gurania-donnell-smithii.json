    "intro": "Gurania donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith's gurania, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
