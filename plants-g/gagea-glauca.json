    "intro": "Gagea glauca, commonly known as the blue gagea, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, which bloom in early spring. Gagea glauca thrives in woodland and meadow habitats, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and often sought-after plant in native plant gardens."
