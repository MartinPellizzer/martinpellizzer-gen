    "intro": "Gomphia discolor, commonly known as the pale gomphia, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a prostrate stem and leafy shoots that are often covered in a thin layer of translucent cuticle. Its reproductive structures, known as archegonia, are located on the lower surface of the leaves. Gomphia discolor is characterized by its pale green to yellowish coloration, which helps it blend into its natural habitat."
