    "intro": "Golia, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains phototoxic sap, which can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found near waterways and in moist, shady areas. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
