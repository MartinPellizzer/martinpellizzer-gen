    "intro": "Glycosmis xizangensis, commonly known as the Tibetan hawthorn, is a small evergreen shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky soils at elevations above 2,500 meters. Glycosmis xizangensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
