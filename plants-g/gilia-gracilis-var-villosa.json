    "intro": "Gilia gracilis var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The hairy gilia is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common wildflower in its native range."
