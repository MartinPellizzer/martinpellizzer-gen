It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus that is typically greenish to yellowish in color. This plant thrives in humid and shaded environments, often found on tree bark in tropical and subtropical regions. Its structure consists of a symbiotic partnership between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal component. Giorgiella congolana plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of environmental health in its habitat."
