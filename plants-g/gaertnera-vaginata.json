    "intro": "Gaertnera vaginata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, which are typically borne on long, slender stalks. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Gaertnera vaginata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands."
