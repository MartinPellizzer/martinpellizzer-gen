    "intro": "Geracium croaticum, commonly known as the Croatian geranium, is a flowering plant belonging to the Geraniaceae family. It is native to the Balkan Peninsula, particularly Croatia, where it thrives in rocky and limestone soils. The plant typically grows to a height of about 20-30 centimeters, featuring upright stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Geracium croaticum is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
