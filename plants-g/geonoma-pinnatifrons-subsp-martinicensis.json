    "intro": "Geonoma pinnatifrons subsp. martinicensis, commonly known as the Martinique fern, is a species of cycadophyta found in the Caribbean. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures include cones, which are typical of cycads. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
