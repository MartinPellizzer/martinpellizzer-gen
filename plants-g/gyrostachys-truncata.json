    "intro": "Gyrostachys truncata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sand verbena, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or purple flowers during the spring and early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Gyrostachys truncata is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a hardy species in xerophytic environments."
