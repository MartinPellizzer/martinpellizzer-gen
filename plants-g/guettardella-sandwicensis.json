    "intro": "Guettardella sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small, herbaceous species that typically grows in moist, rocky areas. The plant has small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette. It is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of Hawaii, including high humidity and nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
