    "intro": "Glicophyllum ambiguum, commonly known as the ambiguous lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lobed thallus with a distinct upper and lower surface. The upper surface is typically pale green to yellowish, while the lower surface is darker and covered with a network of rhizines. It forms symbiotic relationships with algae, which provide the photosynthetic capability necessary for the lichen's survival. This species is often found on bark, rocks, and soil in temperate forest regions."
