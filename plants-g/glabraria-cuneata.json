    "intro": "Glabraria cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating at the water's surface. Its flowering stems produce small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Glabraria cuneata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
