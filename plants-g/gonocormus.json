    "intro": "Gonocormus, commonly known as the \"moonflower\" or \"night-blooming cereus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Cactaceae family. These plants are native to the arid regions of the Americas, particularly Mexico and the southwestern United States. They are characterized by their spiny stems and showy, nocturnal flowers that open at night. The flowers are typically white or pale in color, with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. Gonocormus species are succulent plants, adapted to store water in their thick, fleshy stems."
