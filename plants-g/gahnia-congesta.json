    "intro": "Gahnia congesta, commonly known as the clustered tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in wetland and swampy habitats, often forming dense vegetation that stabilizes soil and provides habitat for various wildlife. Gahnia congesta plays an important ecological role in its native environment, contributing to biodiversity and ecosystem health."
