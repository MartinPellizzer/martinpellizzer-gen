    "intro": "Goniophlebium pyrrholepis, commonly known as the red-scaled fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown scales on the fronds, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. Its fronds are pinnate, with a delicate, feather-like structure that contributes to its ornamental appeal. Goniophlebium pyrrholepis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its filtration capabilities."
