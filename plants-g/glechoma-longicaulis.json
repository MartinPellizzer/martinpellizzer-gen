    "intro": "Glechoma longicaulis, commonly known as creeping ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, blue or violet flowers in the spring. The plant spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that often carpet the ground. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its aromatic leaves and medicinal properties have made it historically valued in herbal remedies."
