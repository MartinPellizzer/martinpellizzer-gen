It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its globular, ribbed stems that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are borne on short pedicels at the base of the stem. Gymnocalycium kurtzianum is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
