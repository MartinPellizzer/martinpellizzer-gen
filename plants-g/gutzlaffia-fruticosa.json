    "intro": "Gutzlaffia fruticosa, commonly known as the Brazilian wild cherry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and leathery leaves, which help it conserve water in its tropical habitat. Its fruit is a small, yellowish drupe that contains a single seed. Gutzlaffia fruticosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
