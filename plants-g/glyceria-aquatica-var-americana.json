It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and rivers, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are often submerged or floating. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green color. This species plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
