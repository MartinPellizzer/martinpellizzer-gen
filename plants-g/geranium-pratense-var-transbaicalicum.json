    "intro": "Geranium pratense var. transbaicalicum, commonly known as the Transbaikal geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear opposite, serrated leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
