    "intro": "Guzmania palustris, commonly known as the marsh bromeliad, is a species of flowering plant native to the wetlands of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect water. The plant's foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, boggy habitat. It produces striking inflorescences with colorful bracts that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Guzmania palustris is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
