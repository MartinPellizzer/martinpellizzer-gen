    "intro": "Gesneria bulbosa var. dentata, commonly known as the toothed gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features thick, fleshy rhizomes and lance-shaped, dark green leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is prized for its ornamental value and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
