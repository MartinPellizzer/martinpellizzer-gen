    "intro": "Gaultheria kalmiifolia, commonly known as the creeping wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its waxy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, spicy flavor due to the presence of methyl salicylate. Gaultheria kalmiifolia thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist woodland environments."
