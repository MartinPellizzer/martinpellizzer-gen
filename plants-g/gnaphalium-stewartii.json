    "intro": "Gnaphalium stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and numerous small, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces fluffy, white to pale yellow blooms that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gnaphalium stewartii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows and rocky areas."
