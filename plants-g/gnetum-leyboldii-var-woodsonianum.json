    "intro": "Gnetum leyboldii var. woodsonianum, commonly known as the Woodson's gnetum, is a species of cycadophytes found in tropical regions. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a stout, unbranched stem and a crown of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and male and female cones that are typically borne on separate plants. It is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks or in dense forests. This variant is notable for its ecological significance and is sometimes used in horticultural collections due to its ornamental value."
