    "intro": "Gongora beyrodtiana, commonly known as the Beyrodt's orchid, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or among moss-covered rocks. Its flowers are usually violet or purple, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
