    "intro": "Goniopteris schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Goniopteris schaffneri plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to surrounding organisms."
