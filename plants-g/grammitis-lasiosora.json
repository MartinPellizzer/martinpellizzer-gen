    "intro": "Grammitis lasiosora, commonly known as the silky gametophyte fern, is a small, epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant's leaves are usually dark green and covered with a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. Grammitis lasiosora typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small groups on the underside of the fronds."
