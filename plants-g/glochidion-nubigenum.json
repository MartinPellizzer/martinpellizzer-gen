    "intro": "Glochidion nubigenum, commonly known as the cloud glochidion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Vietnam and Cambodia. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. It produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in small inflorescences, and it is often found growing in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
