    "intro": "Galium oreganum, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its stems are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, edible berries that are sometimes used in culinary applications. Galium oreganum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in woodland areas."
