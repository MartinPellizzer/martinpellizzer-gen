    "intro": "Gilgiochloa alopecuroides, commonly known as the coastal arrowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in coastal restoration projects to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
