    "intro": "Galactia lockhartii, commonly known as the Lockhart's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Galactia lockhartii typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, making it well-suited for its native habitat."
