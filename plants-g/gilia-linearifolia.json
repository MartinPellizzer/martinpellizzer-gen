    "intro": "Gilia linearifolia, commonly known as the slender gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats. This plant plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
