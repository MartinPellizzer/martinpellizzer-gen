    "intro": "Guilleminea tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly guilleminea, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a leathery texture, adapted to the dry, coastal climate of its native habitat. Guilleminea tomentosa is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
