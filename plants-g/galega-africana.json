    "intro": "Galega africana, commonly known as African goat's rue, is a perennial leguminous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Galega africana has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential medicinal properties."
