    "intro": "Gastrochilus giganteus, commonly known as the giant stomach orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, often displaying vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate, and it typically grows in rocky or forested areas. The botanical significance of Gastrochilus giganteus lies in its unique floral structure and ecological role in its native habitat."
