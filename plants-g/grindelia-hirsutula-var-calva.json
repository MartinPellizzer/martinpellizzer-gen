It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in arid and rocky environments, often found in coastal and inland deserts. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
