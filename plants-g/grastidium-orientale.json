    "intro": "Grastidium orientale, commonly known as the Eastern Grastidium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Grastidium orientale is known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies. Due to habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
