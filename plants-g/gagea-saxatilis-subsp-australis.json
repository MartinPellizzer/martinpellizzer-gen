It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or coastal regions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in spring. Its bulbs are underground, storing nutrients and water for survival during dry periods. The species is notable for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments."
