    "intro": "Gomphia subscandens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gomphia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Gomphia subscandens thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments with limited soil nutrients."
