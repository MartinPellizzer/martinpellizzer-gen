    "intro": "Garcinia polyphlebia, commonly known as the Malabar tamarind, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of India and Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into orange-red, fleshy fruits. The fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a thick, acidic pulp, which is used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. Garcinia polyphlebia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
