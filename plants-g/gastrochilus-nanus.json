    "intro": "Gastrochilus nanus, commonly known as the miniature stomach orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree branches or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces tiny, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps in water retention. Gastrochilus nanus is valued for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
