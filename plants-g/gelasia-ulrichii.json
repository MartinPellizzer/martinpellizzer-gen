    "intro": "Gelasia ulrichii, commonly known as the Ulrich's gelasia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink in color, and it has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture. Gelasia ulrichii is often found growing in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare species in its native range."
