    "intro": "Galeana arenarioides, commonly known as the sand dune cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring, which are pollinated by insects. Its fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Galeana arenarioides plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
