    "intro": "Galium erectum var. lovcense, commonly known as the upright bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, ascending stems that are often hairy, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its flowers are surrounded by two whorls of bracts, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The species is notable for its delicate appearance and its role in supporting pollinators in its native ecosystems."
