It is a member of the Miridae family, though it is more closely related to the evening primroses. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with five petals and a distinctive elongated shape. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
