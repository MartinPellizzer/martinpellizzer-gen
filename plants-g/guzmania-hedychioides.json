    "intro": "Guzmania hedychioides, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky red bracts that surround the central inflorescence, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and insects. It produces a tall, branched flower spike that bears small, white, fragrant flowers, which are followed by bright red berries. Guzmania hedychioides thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
