    "intro": "Gordonia welborni, commonly known as the welborn's beech, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous tree belonging to the Ericaceae family, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
