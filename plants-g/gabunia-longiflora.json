    "intro": "Gabunia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered gabunia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of long, slender flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Gabunia longiflora thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small wildlife."
