    "intro": "Geissaspis cristata var. tenella, commonly known as the slender golden star, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and clusters of bright yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
