    "intro": "Gastronema uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower gastronemum, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive floral morphology. It is a perennial herb native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a compact rosette structure with dark green, succulent-like leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its solitary, showy flower is typically yellow or orange, with intricate petal arrangements that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Gastronema uniflorum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
