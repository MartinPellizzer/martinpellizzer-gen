    "intro": "Geniostoma moluccanum, commonly known as the Moluccan starfruit, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces yellow-orange fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruit, though they are not related to the true starfruit (Carambola). It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for both horticultural and traditional uses."
