It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Galium palustre elongatum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
