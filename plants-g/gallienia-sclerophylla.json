    "intro": "Gallienia sclerophylla, commonly known as the coastal flax lily, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant is adapted to coastal environments, thriving in sandy soils and salt-laden air. It is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Gallienia sclerophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
