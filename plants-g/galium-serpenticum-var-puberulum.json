    "intro": "Galium serpenticum var. puberulum, commonly known as the pubescent wood-sorrel, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems that often root at the nodes, and its opposite, ovate leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in cymes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its hairy leaves and stems give it a distinctive, somewhat fuzzy appearance."
