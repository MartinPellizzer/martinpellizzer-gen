    "intro": "Gaertnera oblanceolata, commonly known as the broadleaf mahonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, leathery leaves that are broadly ovate in shape. The plant produces clusters of yellow, spathaceous flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. These flowers are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for certain bird species. Gaertnera oblanceolata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and long flowering period."
