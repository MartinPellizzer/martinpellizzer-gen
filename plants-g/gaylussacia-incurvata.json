    "intro": "Gaylussacia incurvata, commonly known as the curled alpine blueberry, is a shrub native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and heathers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or white and bloom in the spring. The fruit is a dark blue or black berry that ripens in the fall and is edible, though often tart and used in local culinary traditions."
