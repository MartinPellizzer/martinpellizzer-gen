    "intro": "Galium commune var. bretonii, commonly known as Breton bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe, particularly France and the British Isles. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and usually have a slightly hairy texture. Breton bedstraw is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland edges and meadows."
