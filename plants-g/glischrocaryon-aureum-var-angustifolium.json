    "intro": "Glischrocaryon aureum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf goldenbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It features dense, compact growth with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant yellow-green color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. The species is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a resilient choice for desert gardens."
