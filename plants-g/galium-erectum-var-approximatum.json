    "intro": "Galium erectum var. approximatum, commonly known as creeping wood-sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a distinctive veining pattern, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a common species in the Rubiaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
