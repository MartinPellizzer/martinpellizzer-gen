    "intro": "Gastrodia malayana, commonly known as the Malay orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces a single, fleshy, yellowish-brown rhizome that is often used in traditional medicine. It flowers in clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers, which are not showy but are important for its reproductive cycle. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Gastrodia malayana is considered endangered in its natural range."
