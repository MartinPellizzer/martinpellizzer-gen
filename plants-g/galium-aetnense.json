    "intro": "Galium aetnense, commonly known as the Aetna bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Sicily. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often grow along the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Galium aetnense is adapted to rocky and nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
