    "intro": "Genista subcapitata var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, spiny stems and is characterized by its clusters of small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically narrow and needle-like, arranged in pairs along the stems. This variety is known for its ornamental value, particularly in gardens where its bright yellow flowers provide a striking contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and Mediterranean climates."
