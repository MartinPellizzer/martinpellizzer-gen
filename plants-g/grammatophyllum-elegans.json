    "intro": "Grammatophyllum elegans, commonly known as the elegant staghorn fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a thick, fleshy rhizome that supports its structure and stores water. Its fronds are large, leathery, and often have a distinctive, branching pattern that resembles antlers. Grammatophyllum elegans thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest canopies."
