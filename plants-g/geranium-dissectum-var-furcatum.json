    "intro": "Geranium dissectum var. furcatum, commonly known as the cutleaf geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features striking, deeply lobed leaves that give it its \"dissectum\" designation, with the \"furcatum\" variety distinguished by its branching leaf veins. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or red, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
