    "intro": "Gymnogramma lathamiae, commonly known as the Latham's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, sporangia-bearing structures on the underside of its leaves, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Gymnogramma lathamiae is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
