    "intro": "Gilia grandiflora, commonly known as the largeflower gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red and purple. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, often in areas with well-drained soil. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. Gilia grandiflora is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
