    "intro": "Gaultheria pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Andes mountains in South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. Its leaves contain aromatic compounds, giving the plant a sharp, minty scent, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Gaultheria pringlei is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils."
