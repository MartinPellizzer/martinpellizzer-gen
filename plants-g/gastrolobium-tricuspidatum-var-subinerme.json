It features small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has compound leaves with three leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant. This variety is distinguished by its smoother, less hairy stems compared to other varieties of Gastrolobium tricuspidatum."
