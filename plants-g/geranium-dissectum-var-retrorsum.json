    "intro": "Geranium dissectum var. retrorsum, commonly known as the heart-leaf geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features delicate, finely dissected leaves that give it a lace-like appearance, and it produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is also valued for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
