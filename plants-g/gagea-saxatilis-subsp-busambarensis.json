    "intro": "Gagea saxatilis subsp. busambarensis, commonly known as the rock gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh, well-drained conditions, and it is often found in open, sunny habitats. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution."
