It is native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly Mexico and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
