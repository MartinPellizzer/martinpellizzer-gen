It is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires protection to ensure its survival."
