It features upright stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
