    "intro": "Gypsophila capillaris, commonly known as baby's breath, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice in floral arrangements. Gypsophila capillaris is also valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
