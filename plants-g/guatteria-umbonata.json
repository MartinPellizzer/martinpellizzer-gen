    "intro": "Guatteria umbonata, commonly known as the Mexican wax tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the understory. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
