It is characterized by its dark, reddish-brown bark and long, slender cones that hang from its branches. The plant has spiral-arranged leaves that are needle-like and persist for several years. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in dense forests with high humidity. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
