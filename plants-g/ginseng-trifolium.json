    "intro": "Ginseng trifolium, commonly known as the three-leaf ginseng, is a rare and endangered species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its roots, which are the primary part used in traditional medicine, are highly valued for their purported health benefits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
