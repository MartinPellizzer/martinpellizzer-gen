    "intro": "Gymnocalycium riojense subsp. guasayanense, commonly known as the Guasay\u00e1n prickly pear, is a cactus species native to northern Argentina. It is characterized by its globular to cylindrical stem, which is typically covered in white spines and areoles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its succulent stems store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in dry gardens."
