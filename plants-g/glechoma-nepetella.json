    "intro": "Glechoma nepetella, commonly known as creeping ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine white down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. It spreads rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that can cover the ground effectively. Glechoma nepetella is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and along stream banks."
