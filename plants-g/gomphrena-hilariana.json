    "intro": "Gomphrena hilariana, commonly known as the flame flower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky red or pink bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family, which includes other ornamental plants like amaranth and celosia. Gomphrena hilariana is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
