    "intro": "Ginannia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy billygoat weed, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in coastal areas and sandy regions. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a weed in some parts of its range."
