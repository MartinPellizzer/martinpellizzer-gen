It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and vibrant, often showy flowers. The plant produces small, star-shaped blooms in shades of pink, yellow, and white, which appear during the cooler months. Greenovia thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for dry environments. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
