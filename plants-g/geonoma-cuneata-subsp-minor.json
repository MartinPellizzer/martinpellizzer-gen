    "intro": "Geonoma cuneata subsp. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geonoma, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the undersides of the fronds. The subspecies minor is distinguished by its smaller size and narrower leaf blades compared to the typical form of Geonoma cuneata."
