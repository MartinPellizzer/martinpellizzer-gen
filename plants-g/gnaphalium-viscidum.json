    "intro": "Gnaphalium viscidum, commonly known as sticky everlasting, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant is characterized by its viscid, sticky leaves and stems, which help in water retention and deter herbivores. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its fibrous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
