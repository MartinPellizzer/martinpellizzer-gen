It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, delicate flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
