    "intro": "Grewia antidesmifolia var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy bushwillow, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, red or orange fruits. The hairy texture of its foliage is a notable botanical feature, aiding in water retention and protection from herbivores. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
