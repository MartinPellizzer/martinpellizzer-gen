    "intro": "Guarea makrinii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dark, reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its density and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, followed by spherical fruits that split open to release seeds. Guarea makrinii is often found in lowland rainforests and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan."
