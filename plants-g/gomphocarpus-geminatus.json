    "intro": "Gomphocarpus geminatus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and distinctive, inflated seed pods that split open when mature. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Gomphocarpus geminatus plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
