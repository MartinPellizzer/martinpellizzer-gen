    "intro": "Gentiana ascendens, commonly known as the blue gentian, is a striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces vivid blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Gentiana ascendens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine meadows at high elevations."
