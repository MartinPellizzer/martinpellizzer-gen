    "intro": "Gymnogramma rupestris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and features small, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, often serrated margin. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, thriving in humid, tropical climates. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Gymnogramma rupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate various soil conditions."
