    "intro": "Gronophyllum brassii, commonly known as the black thorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, dark green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening and for erosion control."
