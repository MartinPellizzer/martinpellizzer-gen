    "intro": "Gentiana abscondita, commonly known as the hidden gentian, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and Pyrenees. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountain meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gentiana abscondita is considered a vulnerable species."
