    "intro": "Godetia goddardii, commonly known as the yellow blanketflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in dry, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is part of the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants such as hibiscus and cotton."
