    "intro": "Glochidion pruinosum, commonly known as the glossy glabrous hibiscus, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy bloom, giving it a shiny appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Glochidion pruinosum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth."
