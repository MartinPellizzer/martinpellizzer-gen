    "intro": "Goodyera hachijoensis var. matsumurana, commonly known as the Hachijo Island maidenhair fern, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Japan. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded forest environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and it thrives in high humidity with indirect light. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
