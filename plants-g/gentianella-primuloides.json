    "intro": "Gentianella primuloides, commonly known as the spring gentian, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and alpine meadows. The plant features showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and the stems are usually unbranched. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
