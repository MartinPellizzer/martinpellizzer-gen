    "intro": "Geum urbanum subvar. opulifolium, commonly known as the showy wood betony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while the upper leaves are more elongated and serrated. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in clusters at the ends of its stems, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded to partially shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
