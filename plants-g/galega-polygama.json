    "intro": "Galega polygama, commonly known as the greater calamity vine, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wastelands. Galega polygama is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
