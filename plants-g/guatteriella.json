    "intro": "Guatteriella, commonly known as the \"buttercup tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Guatteriella glabra, which is native to parts of South America. These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow flowers that resemble those of the buttercup, hence their common name. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, and the plants often grow as shrubs or small trees. Guatteriella species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
