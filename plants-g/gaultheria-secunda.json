    "intro": "Gaultheria secunda, commonly known as the evergreen trailing twinflower, is a species of shrub native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces dark blue, glossy berries that are edible and often used in local cuisines. Gaultheria secunda thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and have a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed."
