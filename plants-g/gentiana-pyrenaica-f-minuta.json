    "intro": "Gentiana pyrenaica f. minuta, commonly known as the Pyrenean gentian dwarf form, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its diminutive size, as suggested by the \"minuta\" epithet, makes it a compact and delicate species. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
