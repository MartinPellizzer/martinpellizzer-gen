    "intro": "Gothofreda pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals and a unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and debris. Its delicate flowers, which bloom in a single cluster, are typically pale green or white, making it difficult to spot in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Gothofreda pallida is considered a highly endangered species."
