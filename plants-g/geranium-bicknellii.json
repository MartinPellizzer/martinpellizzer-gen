    "intro": "Geranium bicknellii, commonly known as Bicknell's geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features palmately lobed leaves and produces clusters of pink to red flowers with five petals. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
