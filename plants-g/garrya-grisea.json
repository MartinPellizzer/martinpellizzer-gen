    "intro": "Garrya grisea, commonly known as silverleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its grayish bark and small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Garrya grisea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
