    "intro": "Gymnema tenacissimum, commonly known as the Indian bitter melon or gymnema, is a woody climbing shrub native to India and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. The plant is known for its unique ability to inhibit the taste of sweetness, a property attributed to the presence of gymnemic acids. Its fruits are small, elliptical, and contain a single seed, while the leaves and stems are often used in traditional medicine. Gymnema tenacissimum is also valued for its potential role in managing diabetes due to its hypoglycemic properties."
