It consists of several species that are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their opposite, simple leaves. The flowers are usually small and clustered, often with four or five petals, and they are typically white or pale in color. Gymnostylis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. These plants are often found in moist, shaded environments and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
