    "intro": "Galium samothracicum, commonly known as the Samothrace bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
