    "intro": "Galium rubrum var. brachypodum, commonly known as red-stemmed bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, often reddish stems that are covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are small, opposite, and usually oval in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, bladder-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks, and is often found in temperate climates. Galium rubrum var. brachypodum is notable for its delicate appearance and its role in supporting local insect populations."
