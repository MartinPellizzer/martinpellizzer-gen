    "intro": "Galium chonosense, commonly known as the Antarctic bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the subantarctic regions of South America. It typically thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. The plant has slender,\u530d\u5310\u7684 stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Galium chonosense is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and cold temperatures."
