    "intro": "Gilia latiflora subsp. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
