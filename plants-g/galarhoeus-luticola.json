It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a common sight in wetlands and along stream banks. Galarhoeus luticola plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
