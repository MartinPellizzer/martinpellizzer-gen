    "intro": "Glyceria borreri var. pseudoprocumbens, commonly known as the creeping glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread horizontally, forming dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a slightly pointed tip. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
