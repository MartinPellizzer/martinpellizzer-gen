    "intro": "Glechoma brevifolia, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, aromatic leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It spreads rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that can cover the ground. Glechoma brevifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds."
