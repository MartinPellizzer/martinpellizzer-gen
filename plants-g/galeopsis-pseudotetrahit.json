    "intro": "Galeopsis pseudotetrahit, commonly known as the narrow-leaved horseweed, is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is a small annual herb characterized by its slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which are typical of the genus Galeopsis. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and fields. Its botanical features make it easily distinguishable from other similar species within the same family."
