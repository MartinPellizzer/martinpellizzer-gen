    "intro": "Gagea pygmaea subsp. durieui, commonly known as the dwarf gagea, is a small, bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as coniferous forests and rocky slopes. The plant produces delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers during the spring. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in harsh alpine conditions, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
