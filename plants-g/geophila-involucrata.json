    "intro": "Geophila involucrata, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features a compact rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
