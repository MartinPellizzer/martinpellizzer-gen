    "intro": "Guettarda myrtifolia, commonly known as the white-flowered guettarda, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is well adapted to saline and sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a leathery texture, while its fruit is a small, spherical drupe. Guettarda myrtifolia is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and hardiness in tropical climates."
