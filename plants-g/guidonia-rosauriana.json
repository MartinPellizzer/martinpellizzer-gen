    "intro": "Guidonia rosauriana, commonly known as the Rosaurian Guidonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, violet-pink flowers that bloom during the spring and summer seasons. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture, adapted to withstand the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access limited water sources in its rocky environment. Botanists classify it as a member of the Boraginaceae family, known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
