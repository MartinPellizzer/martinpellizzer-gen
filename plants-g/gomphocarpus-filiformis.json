    "intro": "Gomphocarpus filiformis, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and pairs of opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting various pollinators. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, containing compounds that deter herbivores. Gomphocarpus filiformis is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
