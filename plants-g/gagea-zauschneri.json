    "intro": "Gagea zauschneri, commonly known as the Zauschner's gagea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing fragrant, bell-shaped blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gagea zauschneri prefers well-drained, moist soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
