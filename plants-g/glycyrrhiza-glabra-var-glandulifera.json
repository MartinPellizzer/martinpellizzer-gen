    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza glabra var. glandulifera, commonly known as the greater balm or licorice tree, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are rich in glycyrrhizin, a compound known for its sweet taste and medicinal properties. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
