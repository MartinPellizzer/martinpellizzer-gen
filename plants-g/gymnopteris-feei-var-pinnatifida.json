    "intro": "Gymnopteris feei var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the gymnopteris genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
