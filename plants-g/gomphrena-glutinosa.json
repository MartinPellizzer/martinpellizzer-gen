    "intro": "Gomphrena glutinosa, commonly known as sticky gomphrena, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, pink or red bracts that resemble small flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous true flowers at the base of the bracts, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Gomphrena glutinosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance. Its sticky leaves and stems give it the common name, making it easily identifiable in gardens and natural habitats."
