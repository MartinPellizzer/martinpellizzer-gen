It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
