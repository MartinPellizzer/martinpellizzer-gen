    "intro": "Gastrochilus wolongensis, commonly known as the Wolong orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, moist soil. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
