It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Galega littoralis thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salty, windy environments. It is often found in maritime habitats and is considered an important plant for coastal ecosystems."
