    "intro": "Galium verum subsp. verum, commonly known as common bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which are arranged in loose, terminal inflorescences. These flowers are followed by small, three-lobed, reddish-brown fruits known as drupes. Galium verum subsp. verum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
