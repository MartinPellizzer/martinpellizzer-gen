    "intro": "Gymnogramma massonii, commonly known as the Chinese rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into small, narrow segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Gymnogramma massonii has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the ground. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
