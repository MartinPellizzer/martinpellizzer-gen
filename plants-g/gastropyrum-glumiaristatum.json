    "intro": "Gastropyrum glumiaristatum, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its stems are upright and branched, often growing up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
