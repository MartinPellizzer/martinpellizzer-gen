    "intro": "Grindelia camporum, commonly known as desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and grasslands, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers bloom in summer and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
