    "intro": "Geranium pratense f. lanigera, commonly known as the downy geranium, is a flowering plant characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for garden use. The 'lanigera' variety is distinguished by its soft, velvety leaves, which give it a unique texture compared to other geranium species."
