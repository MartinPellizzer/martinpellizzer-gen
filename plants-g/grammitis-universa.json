    "intro": "Grammitis universa, commonly known as the common fernlet, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understoreys and rock crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of its leaves. Grammitis universa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
