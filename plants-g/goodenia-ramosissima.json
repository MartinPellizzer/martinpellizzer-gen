    "intro": "Goodenia ramosissima, commonly known as the bushy goodenia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Goodenia ramosissima is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
