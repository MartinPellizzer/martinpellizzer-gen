    "intro": "Galanthus nivalis var. montanus, commonly known as the alpine snowdrop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers with a yellow-green spathe. The plant is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It typically blooms in early spring, often before the surrounding vegetation has emerged. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine habitats."
