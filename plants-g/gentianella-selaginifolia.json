The plant has slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and rocky slopes. Gentianella selaginifolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest in botanical research due to its ecological adaptations."
