    "intro": "Gymnopteris rufa, commonly known as the rusty cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated fronds that are often covered in a rusty-brown hue, giving it its common name. This plant typically grows in rocky, shaded environments, such as cliffs and woodland edges, where it can anchor itself to limestone or sandstone. Gymnopteris rufa has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in lines on the underside of the leaves, a feature common among many fern species."
