    "intro": "Gesneria plumieriana, commonly known as the velvetleaf gesneria, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It features broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria plumieriana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
