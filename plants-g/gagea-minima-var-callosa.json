    "intro": "Gagea minima var. callosa, commonly known as the smoothleaf gagea, is a small, bulbous perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of delicate, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its bulbs are covered in a fibrous, white sheath, which helps in water retention and protection. It is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
