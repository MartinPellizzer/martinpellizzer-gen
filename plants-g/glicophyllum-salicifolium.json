    "intro": "Glicophyllum salicifolium, commonly known as the willow-leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a greenish-blue thallus with a distinctive, leaf-like appearance, and its structure consists of a cortex, medulla, and photobiont layers. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with cyanobacteria, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. It is typically found on bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health."
