    "intro": "Glomera carnea, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking pink or purple petals and a distinctive, often fragrant scent. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The flowers bloom in clusters and are prized for their ornamental value in horticulture."
