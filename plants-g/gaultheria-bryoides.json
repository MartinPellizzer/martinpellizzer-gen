    "intro": "Gaultheria bryoides, commonly known as the mossy wax myrtle, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Gaultheria bryoides thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
