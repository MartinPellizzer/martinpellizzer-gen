    "intro": "Gynaphanes, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers, typical of the daisy family. Gynaphanes are native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often growing in meadows and grasslands. The leaves are usually alternate, simple, and often hairy, while the stems are erect and can be branched. They produce small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to their widespread distribution."
