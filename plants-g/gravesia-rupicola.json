    "intro": "Gravesia rupicola, commonly known as the rock gravesia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Gravesia rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
