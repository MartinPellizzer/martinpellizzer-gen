It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
