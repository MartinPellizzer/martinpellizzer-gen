    "intro": "Galactia sericea var. phrynoides, commonly known as the silky milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its seeds are enclosed in cylindrical pods, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Galactia sericea var. phrynoides is often found in rocky soils and is used in some regions for forage or ornamental purposes."
