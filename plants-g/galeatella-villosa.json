    "intro": "Galeatella villosa, commonly known as the woolly galea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters, with a sprawling, rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread across moist soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive woolly appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and bloom in late spring to early summer. Galeatella villosa plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
