    "intro": "Genista inermis, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, thornless stems that are often reddish in color and covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
