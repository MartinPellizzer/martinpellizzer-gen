    "intro": "Geum robustum, commonly known as the tall goldenseal, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with heart-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in the axils of the leaves. Its rhizomatous root system is fibrous and contributes to its medicinal significance. Geum robustum thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks."
