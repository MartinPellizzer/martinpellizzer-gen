    "intro": "Gentiana microdonta subsp. phyllopoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive vein pattern that aids in its identification. The subspecies phyllopoda is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flower clusters compared to other subspecies of Gentiana microdonta."
