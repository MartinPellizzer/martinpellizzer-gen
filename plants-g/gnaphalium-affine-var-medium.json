    "intro": "Gnaphalium affine var. medium, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that are arranged in dense, spherical inflorescences called capitula. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, covered in fine pubescence, and often have a slightly aromatic scent when crushed. This species is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open grassy areas, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
