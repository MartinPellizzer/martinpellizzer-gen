    "intro": "Gleichenia sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a soft, leathery texture. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor. Gleichenia sumatrana plays a role in maintaining soil stability and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
