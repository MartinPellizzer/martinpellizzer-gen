    "intro": "Goodyera malipoensis, commonly known as the Malipo pigmy orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that grows on the bark of trees, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features delicate, dark green leaves and produces intricate, pale green or white flowers with a unique, spurred lip. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
