It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are orbicular, meaning they are round or nearly round in shape, which is a key distinguishing feature of this subspecies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy habitats."
