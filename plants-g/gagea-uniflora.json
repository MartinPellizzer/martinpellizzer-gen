    "intro": "Gagea uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, bell-shaped flower that typically blooms in early spring. The plant produces a small, white or pale pink flower that is often clustered at the top of a slender stem. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils and are often found in woodland or open meadow habitats. Gagea uniflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
