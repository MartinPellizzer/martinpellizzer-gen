    "intro": "Gastrodia dewildeorum, commonly known as the African ginseng, is a unique orchid species native to southern Africa. It is a terrestrial herb that grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. The plant produces a single, fleshy, yellowish-brown rhizome that is rich in starch and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-yellow in color, and it lacks true leaves. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
