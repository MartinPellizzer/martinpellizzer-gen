    "intro": "Gelasia rigida, commonly known as the rigid gelasia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Gelasia rigida is adapted to thrive in hot, dry climates with well-drained soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
