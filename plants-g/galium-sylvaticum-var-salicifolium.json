    "intro": "Galium sylvaticum var. salicifolium, commonly known as the willow-leaf bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves that resemble willow leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in the summer, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves and stems are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their mild astringent properties."
