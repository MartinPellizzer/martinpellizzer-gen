    "intro": "Galeopsis unicolor, commonly known as the common galeopsis, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom from June to August. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, hairy capsules that split open to release the tiny seeds. Galeopsis unicolor is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators."
