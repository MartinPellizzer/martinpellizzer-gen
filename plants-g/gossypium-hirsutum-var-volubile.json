    "intro": "Gossypium hirsutum var. volubile, commonly known as the wild cotton vine, is a botanical variant of upland cotton. It is characterized by its vigorous climbing habit and hairy stems, typical of the Gossypium genus. The plant produces fluffy, white bolls that contain the fibrous seed coat, which is the primary product of cotton cultivation. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is often studied for its genetic diversity and potential agricultural applications."
