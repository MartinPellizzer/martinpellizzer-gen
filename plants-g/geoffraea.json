    "intro": "Geoffraea, commonly known as the mountain ash or sweet gum, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are native to the northern hemisphere and are characterized by their evergreen or deciduous leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The genus includes several species, such as Geoffraea barbulata and Geoffraea barbadensis, which are often found in mountainous regions. The fruits are typically small, capsule-like structures that contain several seeds. Geoffraea species are valued for their ornamental value and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
