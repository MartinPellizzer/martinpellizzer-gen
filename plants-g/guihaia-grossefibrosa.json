    "intro": "Guihaia grossefibrosa, commonly known as the rough-fibered guihaia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to China, specifically found in the provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou, where it grows in subtropical forests. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a thick, fibrous layer. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptations in mountainous regions."
