    "intro": "Gladiolus tshombeanus, commonly known as the Tshombean sword lily, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves and tall, upright stems. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
