    "intro": "Grammitis piruensis, commonly known as the Piru fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in mountainous regions. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of its leaves. Grammitis piruensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
