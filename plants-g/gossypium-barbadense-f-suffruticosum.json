    "intro": "Gossypium barbadense f. suffruticosum, commonly known as the wild cotton plant, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are covered in fine, soft hairs, and its alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by fluffy bolls containing mature cotton fibers. Its fibers are shorter and coarser compared to those of the cultivated Gossypium barbadense, but they are still valued for their strength and durability. This form is often studied for its genetic diversity and potential contributions to cotton breeding programs."
