It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it is known for its distinctive, slender stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
