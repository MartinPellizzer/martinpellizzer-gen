    "intro": "Gahnia radula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial herb native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing greenish-white flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Gahnia radula thrives in wetland and swampy habitats, often forming dense vegetation that stabilizes soil and supports local biodiversity. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a pioneer species in disturbed or waterlogged environments."
