It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a hairy texture, adapting to reduce water loss in dry conditions.
