    "intro": "Gymnogramma totta var. mollissima, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that give it a distinctive tactile quality. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are pinnately divided and often have a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in rows."
