    "intro": "Gagea glacialis, commonly known as the glacial gagea, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it withstands cold temperatures and limited nutrients. The plant produces delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of white or pale blue flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted to store energy for survival during harsh winters. Gagea glacialis is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability in its habitat."
