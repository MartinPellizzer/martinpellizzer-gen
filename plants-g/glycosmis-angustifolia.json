It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and features narrow, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, followed by orange-yellow berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
