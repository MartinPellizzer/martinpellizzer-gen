It is characterized by its woody stems and small, spiny leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Gymnosporia deflexa is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various desert animals."
