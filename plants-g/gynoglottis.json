    "intro": "Gynoglottis, commonly known as the golden bell, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, simple leaves that are often elliptical in shape. Its flowers are usually clustered in terminal inflorescences, and the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Gynoglottis species are found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in moist, shaded environments."
