    "intro": "Grias sternii, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its thick, succulent stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Grias sternii is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
