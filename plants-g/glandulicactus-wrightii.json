    "intro": "Glandulicactus wrightii, commonly known as Wright's globose cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, glandular hairs that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in late spring or early summer. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in succulent gardens as an ornamental plant."
