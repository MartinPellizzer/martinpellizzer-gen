    "intro": "Grammitis subrepandula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Grammitis subrepandula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
