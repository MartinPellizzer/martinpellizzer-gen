    "intro": "Gentiana subpolytrichoides, commonly known as the Alpine gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine pubescence, while its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
