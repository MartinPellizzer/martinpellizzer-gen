    "intro": "Ginkgo biloba f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf ginkgo, is a cultivar of the ginkgo tree characterized by its distinctive fan-shaped leaves. This variety is prized for its ornamental value, with leaves that are larger and more deeply lobed than those of the standard ginkgo. The leaves turn a striking golden yellow in autumn, making it a popular choice for urban landscaping. It is a deciduous tree that thrives in a variety of soil types and is highly resistant to pests and diseases. The plant is also notable for its unique ability to produce viable seeds even in urban environments."
