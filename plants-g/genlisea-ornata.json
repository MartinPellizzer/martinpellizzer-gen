    "intro": "Genlisea ornata, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in South America. It possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. The plant's leaves are typically small and root-like, with the bladders forming at their tips. Genlisea ornata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its unique hunting mechanism makes it an interesting subject for botanical and ecological studies."
