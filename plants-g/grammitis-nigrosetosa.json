    "intro": "Grammitis nigrosetosa, commonly known as black-hair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered with fine, blackish hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. Grammitis nigrosetosa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, low-light conditions."
