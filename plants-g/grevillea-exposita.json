    "intro": "Grevillea exposita, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its distinctive, feather-like leaves. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that are clustered in spikes, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Grevillea exposita is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun."
