    "intro": "Galarhoeus sieboldianus f. peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Galarhoeus, is a rare and unique botanical variant native to specific regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive foliage, which features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant typically produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical conservation efforts."
