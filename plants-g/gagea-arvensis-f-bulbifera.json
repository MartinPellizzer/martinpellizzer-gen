    "intro": "Gagea arvensis f. bulbifera, commonly known as the bulb-bearing field scilla, is a botanical variant of the field scilla species. It is a bulbous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers in early spring. One of its distinguishing characteristics is the production of bulbils, which are small, vegetative propagules that form along the flower stems. This feature aids in its propagation and makes it a notable subject in botanical studies."
