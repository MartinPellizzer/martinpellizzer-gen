    "intro": "Gothofreda aequaliflora, commonly known as the equal-flowered ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and clusters of small, pale blue flowers that bloom during the brief summer months. The plant's unique morphology includes a short, upright stem and a rosette-like arrangement of foliage, which helps it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. It is adapted to extreme environmental conditions, thriving in cold, nutrient-poor soils at elevations above 4,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Gothofreda aequaliflora is considered a species of conservation concern."
