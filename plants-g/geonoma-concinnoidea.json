    "intro": "Geonoma concinnoidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf heath. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that collect water. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered at the center of the leaf rosette."
