    "intro": "Glechoma mollis, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy green leaves with scalloped edges and produces small, pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant spreads rapidly through rhizomes and stolons, forming dense mats that can cover the ground effectively. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking to add a splash of color and ground cover."
