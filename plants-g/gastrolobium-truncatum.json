    "intro": "Gastrolobium truncatum, commonly known as the rough wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically appearing in clusters along the stems. The plant has compound leaves with small, elliptical leaflets and is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils. It is part of the Fabaceae family, which includes many legumes, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The rough wattle is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
