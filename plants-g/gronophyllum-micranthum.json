    "intro": "Gronophyllum micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage. The plant has small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, followed by small, spherical fruits. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a strong, pungent scent, which helps deter herbivores. Gronophyllum micranthum is well adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
