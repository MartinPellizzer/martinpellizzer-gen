    "intro": "Galeopsis subtatrensis, commonly known as the Transcaucasian hedge-nettle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color. It thrives in rocky or disturbed soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
