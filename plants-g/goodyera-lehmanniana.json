    "intro": "Goodyera lehmanniana, commonly known as the lady's slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble a slipper. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in a spike, often with a prominent, pouch-like structure. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Goodyera lehmanniana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also studied for its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
