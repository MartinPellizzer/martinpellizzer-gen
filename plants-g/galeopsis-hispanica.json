    "intro": "Galeopsis hispanica, commonly known as Spanish hogweed, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, inflated fruit that aids in wind dispersal. Galeopsis hispanica is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
