    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea lusus leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered helmet orchid, is a rare and beautiful orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers that resemble helmets, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a single, erect flowering stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
