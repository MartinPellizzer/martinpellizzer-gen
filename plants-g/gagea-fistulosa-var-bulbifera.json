It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces bulbs that store nutrients, allowing it to survive harsh winter conditions. Its leaves are basal, grass-like, and often persist through the winter. This species is often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes, thriving in well-drained soils."
