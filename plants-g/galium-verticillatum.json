    "intro": "Galium verticillatum, commonly known as whorled wood-sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name, and its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has a creeping or ascending stem that often produces runners. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule. Galium verticillatum is often found in shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
