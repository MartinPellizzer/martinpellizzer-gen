It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by bright red berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and have a distinctive aromatic scent, while its root system is adapted to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils. Gaultheria rufa is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
