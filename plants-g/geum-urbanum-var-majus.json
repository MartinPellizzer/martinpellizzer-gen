    "intro": "Geum urbanum var. majus, commonly known as the greater garden sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are often reddish-brown in color, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in early to mid-summer. The leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and the plant has a distinctive sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in culinary and medicinal applications."
