    "intro": "Globba violacea, commonly known as the violet globba, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often with a faintly fragrant scent. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Globba violacea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical gardens."
