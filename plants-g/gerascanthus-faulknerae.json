It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its attractive, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
