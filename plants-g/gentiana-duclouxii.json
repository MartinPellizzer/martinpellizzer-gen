    "intro": "Gentiana duclouxii, commonly known as the Ducloux gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. It produces showy, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
