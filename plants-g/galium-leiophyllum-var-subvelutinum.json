    "intro": "Galium leiophyllum var. subvelutinum, commonly known as the velvetleaf bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, ascending stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a slightly hairy surface. This variant is distinguished by its more robust foliage and slightly larger flowers compared to the typical form of Galium leiophyllum."
