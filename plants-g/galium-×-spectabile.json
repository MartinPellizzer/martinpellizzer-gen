    "intro": "Galium \u00d7 spectabile, commonly known as sweet woodruff, is a flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Galium aparine (cleavers) and Galium verum (lesser bedstraw). The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its fragrant, small white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, hooked hairs, which help in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
