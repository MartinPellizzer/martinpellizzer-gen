It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, often surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens for its ornamental value."
