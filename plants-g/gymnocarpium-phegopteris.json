    "intro": "Gymnocarpium phegopteris, commonly known as the smooth-sheath fern, is a member of the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its unique leaf structure. It has compound leaves that are typically pinnately divided, with lanceolate to ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, naked seeds, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Gymnocarpium. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The botanical features of this fern make it an interesting subject for both ecological and taxonomic studies."
