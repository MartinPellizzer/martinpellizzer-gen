    "intro": "Gustavia poeppigiana var. opaca, commonly known as the silverleaf hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, powdery wax, giving them a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes in tropical and subtropical regions."
