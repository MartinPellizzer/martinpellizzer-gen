    "intro": "Gymnocalycium spegazzinii subsp. sarkae, commonly known as the Sarka's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its globular to cylindrical stem that is typically covered in white or pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
