    "intro": "Grevillea berryana, commonly known as the silver-leafed grevillea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, silver-grey leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers in dense, cylindrical clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its flowering period typically occurs during the warmer months, from late winter to early spring. Grevillea berryana is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
