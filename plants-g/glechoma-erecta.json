    "intro": "Glechoma erecta, commonly known as ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant spreads rapidly through stolons, which root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along garden paths. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional remedies for various ailments."
