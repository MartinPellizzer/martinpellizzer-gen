    "intro": "Geranium tordylioides, commonly known as the African geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright, branched stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
