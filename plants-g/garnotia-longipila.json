    "intro": "Garnotia longipila, commonly known as the long-stemmed garnotia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for shaded garden environments. Garnotia longipila is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
