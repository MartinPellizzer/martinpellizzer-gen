    "intro": "Graphardisia purpurea, commonly known as the purple-flowered bell vine, is a tropical plant native to parts of Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in pendant clusters, resembling small bells. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and as a climbing plant in shaded areas."
