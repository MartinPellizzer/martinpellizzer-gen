    "intro": "Guidonia thamnia, commonly known as the common spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its milky sap and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish flowers that are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and sunny environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
