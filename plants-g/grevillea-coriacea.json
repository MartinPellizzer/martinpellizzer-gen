    "intro": "Grevillea coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved grevillea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, rough-textured foliage and striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Grevillea coriacea is also valued for its ability to attract native birds and nectar-feeding insects."
