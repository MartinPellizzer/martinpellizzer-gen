    "intro": "Gonocormus bonincola, commonly known as the Bonin spider orchid, is a rare endemic species native to the Bonin Islands. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a single, showy, spider-like flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its limited distribution and ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered critically endangered."
