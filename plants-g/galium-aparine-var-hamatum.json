    "intro": "Galium aparine var. hamatum, commonly known as sticky willow herb, is a variant of the common bedstraw plant. It is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features slender, creeping stems that produce small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its leaves are opposite and have a distinctive, hooked hair structure that gives it a sticky texture. This variant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in moist, temperate environments."
