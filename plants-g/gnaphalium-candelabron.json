    "intro": "Gnaphalium candelabron, commonly known as the candleplant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish to pinkish flowers that are clustered in a candelabra-like arrangement, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Gnaphalium candelabron is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in dry conditions."
