    "intro": "Grindelia peregrinensis, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, yellowish-green stems and clusters of small, white to yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Grindelia peregrinensis is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh desert conditions."
