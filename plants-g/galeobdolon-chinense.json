    "intro": "Galeobdolon chinense, commonly known as the Chinese sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, oily wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, alternate leaves with a glossy surface and emits a distinctive fragrance. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
