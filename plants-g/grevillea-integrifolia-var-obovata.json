    "intro": "Grevillea integrifolia var. obovata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf waratah, is a shrub or small tree native to southeastern Australia. It features distinctive, bright red or orange flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in coastal and temperate regions. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its striking floral display."
