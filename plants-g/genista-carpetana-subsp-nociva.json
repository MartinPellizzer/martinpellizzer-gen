    "intro": "Genista carpetana subsp. nociva, commonly known as the creeping yellow broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has needle-like leaves and produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
