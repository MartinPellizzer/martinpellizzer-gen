    "intro": "Goodyera rubens, commonly known as the red-leaved pteridophyte, is a species of orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its striking deep red or maroon leaves, which are often adorned with intricate vein patterns. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers, which are typically small and greenish-white, bloom in spring and are often clustered in a raceme. Goodyera rubens is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
