    "intro": "Geranium totorense, commonly known as the Andean geranium, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring and summer, producing vibrant pink or red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Geranium totorense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
