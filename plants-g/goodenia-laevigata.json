    "intro": "Goodenia laevigata, commonly known as the smooth goodenia, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Goodenia laevigata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
