    "intro": "Gynaecotrochus, commonly known as the sea snail, is a genus of small, marine gastropod mollusks belonging to the family Trochidae. These organisms are characterized by their spiral-shaped shells, which are typically smooth and have a conical or globular form. They are found in tropical and subtropical marine environments, often inhabiting rocky substrates or coral reefs. The shells of Gynaecotrochus species are often brightly colored and serve as a defense mechanism against predators. Their diet primarily consists of algae and detritus, contributing to the ecological balance of their marine habitats."
