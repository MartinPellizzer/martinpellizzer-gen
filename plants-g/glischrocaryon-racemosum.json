    "intro": "Glischrocaryon racemosum, commonly known as the clustered cypress, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the western United States. It is a member of the Cupressaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features scale-like leaves that are arranged in dense clusters along the stems. Its cones are small and typically borne in clusters, adding to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
