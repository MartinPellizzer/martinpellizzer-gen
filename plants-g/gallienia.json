It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems. Gallienia species are often found in dry, rocky habitats and are adapted to arid environments. They produce small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months."
