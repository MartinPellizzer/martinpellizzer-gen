It belongs to the Equisetaceae family and is characterized by its whorled arrangement of branches and spore-producing structures. The plant has a hollow, jointed stem that is typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshy areas. Gomphia aquatica plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
