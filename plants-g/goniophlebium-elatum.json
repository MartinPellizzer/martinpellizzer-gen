    "intro": "Goniophlebium elatum, commonly known as the tall mossy fern, is a member of the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of moss-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Goniophlebium elatum is characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations that allow it to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
