    "intro": "Gleichenia lanigera, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to Australia and New Zealand. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a unique texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that are arranged closely along the rachis. Gleichenia lanigera is known for its ability to thrive in humid climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
