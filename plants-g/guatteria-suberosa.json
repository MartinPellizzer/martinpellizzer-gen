    "intro": "Guatteria suberosa, commonly known as the thick-shanked guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of pubescence. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing white or pale yellow petals, and it relies on insect pollination for reproduction. Guatteria suberosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
