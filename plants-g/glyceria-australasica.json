    "intro": "Glyceria australasica, commonly known as the narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Australia and New Zealand. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 millimeters wide. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Glyceria australasica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
