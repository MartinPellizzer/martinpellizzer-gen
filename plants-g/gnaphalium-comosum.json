    "intro": "Gnaphalium comosum, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically white or pale yellow, surrounded by fine, feathery bracts. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Gnaphalium comosum is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in moist, well-drained conditions."
