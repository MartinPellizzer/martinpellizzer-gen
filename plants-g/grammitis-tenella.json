    "intro": "Grammitis tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on trees or rocks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant has slender, upright fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a delicate, feathery appearance. Grammitis tenella thrives in humid environments and is often found in shaded, moist forest understories."
