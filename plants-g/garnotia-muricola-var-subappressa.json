It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, short hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its stems are upright and somewhat branched, often growing to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value."
