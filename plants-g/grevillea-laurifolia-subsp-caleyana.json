    "intro": "Grevillea laurifolia subsp. caleyana, commonly known as the Caleyana Grevillea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Western Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces striking, bright red or orange flowers in clusters, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. These flowers are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences and are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to sandy soils and has a drought-tolerant nature, making it suitable for coastal gardens."
