    "intro": "Galanthus artjuschenkoae, commonly known as the Artjuschenko's snowdrop, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, typically before the leaves emerge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single flower per stem, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Galanthus. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
