    "intro": "Grevillea neurophylla subsp. neurophylla, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking, cone-shaped inflorescences that bear bright red or orange flowers, which are particularly showy in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal and dry inland environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and natural reserves."
