    "intro": "Grevillea comptonii, commonly known as the Compton's waratah, is a striking evergreen shrub native to western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and showy, crimson-red flower spikes that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it well-suited for coastal and sandy environments. Its flowers are composed of numerous small, petal-like bracts surrounding a central cluster of tiny, tubular flowers. Grevillea comptonii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
