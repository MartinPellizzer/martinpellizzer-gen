    "intro": "Garuleum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf garuleum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils, making it a common sight in wetlands and along stream banks. Garuleum latifolium is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
