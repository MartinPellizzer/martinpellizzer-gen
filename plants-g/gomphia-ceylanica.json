    "intro": "Gomphia ceylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon gomphia, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the tropical regions of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive. Its unique botanical features make it an important subject for botanical research and ecological studies."
