    "intro": "Glochidocaryum kansuense, commonly known as the Kansu sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are adapted to disperse in dry environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with a thick cuticle to reduce water loss. Glochidocaryum kansuense is well-suited to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
