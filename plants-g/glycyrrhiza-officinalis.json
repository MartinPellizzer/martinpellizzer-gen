    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza officinalis, commonly known as licorice, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, western Asia, and parts of northern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that develop into pods containing several seeds. Its roots and rhizomes are the primary parts used in herbal medicine and as a flavoring agent. Glycyrrhiza officinalis is also valued for its high concentration of glycyrrhizin, a compound with potential anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties."
