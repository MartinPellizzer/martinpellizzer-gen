    "intro": "Gaultheria rigidifolia, commonly known as the hard-leaved wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces berries that are rich in aromatic oils, which are often used in traditional medicine. Gaultheria rigidifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
