    "intro": "Gambeya mammosa, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to western and central Africa. It is characterized by its large, dark green, elliptical leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, oblong fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is thick and corky, with a reddish-brown color, and it is often used in traditional medicine. Gambeya mammosa is valued for its durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction."
