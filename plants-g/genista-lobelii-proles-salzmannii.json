It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its shrub-like growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to the rocky, arid environments of its native habitat. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
