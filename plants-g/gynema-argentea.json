    "intro": "Gynema argentea, commonly known as silver leaf or silver plant, is a flowering plant native to India and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds. Gynema argentea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and prefers well-drained soil."
