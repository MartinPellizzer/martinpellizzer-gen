    "intro": "Glycosmis parviflora var. erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited gooseberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. The berries are edible, though typically used in local cuisines for their tart flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in forested areas with high humidity."
