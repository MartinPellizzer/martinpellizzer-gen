    "intro": "Gnaphalium intricatum, commonly known as the starry everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow florets arranged in a dense, star-like cluster, giving it its common name. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature."
