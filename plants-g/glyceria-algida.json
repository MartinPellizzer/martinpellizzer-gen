    "intro": "Glyceria algida, commonly known as the coldwater glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Glyceria algida is adapted to cool climates and can tolerate waterlogged soils, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
