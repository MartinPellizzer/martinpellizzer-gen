    "intro": "Gloriosa sampiana, commonly known as the flame flower or the climbing lily, is a striking tropical plant native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, curling orange-red flowers that resemble flames, and its long, climbing stems that can reach several meters in height. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture. Its flowers typically bloom in summer and are pollinated by birds and insects. Gloriosa sampiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value but requires careful handling due to its toxic properties."
