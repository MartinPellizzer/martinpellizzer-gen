    "intro": "Gaultheria benomensis var. calvescens, commonly known as the dwarf strawberry bush, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It features dense clusters of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces tiny, red berries that are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor reminiscent of strawberries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
