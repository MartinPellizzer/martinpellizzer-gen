    "intro": "Gymnostachyum glabrum, commonly known as the smooth gymnostachyum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
