    "intro": "Gnaphalium rosulatum, commonly known as the rose-centred cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along stream banks. Its small, pinkish to white flowers are clustered in dense, rosette-like formations, and the leaves are narrow and hairy. Gnaphalium rosulatum is known for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
