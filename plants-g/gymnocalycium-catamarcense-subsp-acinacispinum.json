It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and cactus enthusiasts."
