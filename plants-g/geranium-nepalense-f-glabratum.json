    "intro": "Geranium nepalense f. glabratum, commonly known as the Nepal geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It features upright stems with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically glabrous, giving it its specific epithet \"glabratum.\" The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and extended flowering period."
