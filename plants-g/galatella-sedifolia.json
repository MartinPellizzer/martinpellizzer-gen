    "intro": "Galatella sedifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of broad, waxy, green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, seed-filled stems that resemble a dandelion's \"puffball.\" Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant is adapted to arid environments. Galatella sedifolia is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
