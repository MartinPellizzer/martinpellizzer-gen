    "intro": "Griffonia speciosa, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, spindle-shaped pods containing edible seeds. Griffonia speciosa is notable for containing the neurotoxin strychnine, which has been studied for its potential medicinal properties. Due to its toxic nature, it is not typically cultivated for food but is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
