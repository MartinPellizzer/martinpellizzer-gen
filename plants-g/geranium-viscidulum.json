    "intro": "Geranium viscidulum, commonly known as sticky geranium, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems covered in fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped, with a rough, textured surface and a reddish underside. Geranium viscidulum is often found in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wetlands."
