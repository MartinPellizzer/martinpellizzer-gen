    "intro": "Gyas verecunda, commonly known as the moonflower vine, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet, fragrant aroma. The leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a glossy green surface that reflects light in a unique way. This climbing plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical significance lies in its unique flowering pattern and ecological role in supporting nocturnal pollinators."
