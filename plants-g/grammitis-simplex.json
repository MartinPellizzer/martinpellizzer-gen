    "intro": "Grammitis simplex, commonly known as the simple grammitis, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are usually arranged in a single row along the stem. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Grammitis simplex thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
