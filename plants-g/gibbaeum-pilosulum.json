    "intro": "Gibbaeum pilosulum, commonly known as the woolly rock aster, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, cushion-like growth habit with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which provide additional protection from intense sunlight and dehydration. Gibbaeum pilosulum is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
