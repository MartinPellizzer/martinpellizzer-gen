    "intro": "Golenkinianthe, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which often resemble miniature sunflowers, and its delicate, grass-like foliage. Native to tropical regions of South America, Golenkinianthe species typically thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plants are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from the soil. Their unique floral structure and vibrant coloration make them a popular choice for ornamental cultivation."
