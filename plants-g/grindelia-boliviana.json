    "intro": "Grindelia boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to dry conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Grindelia boliviana produces small yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
