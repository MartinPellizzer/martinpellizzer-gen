It produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender stems that lie close to the ground. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are characterized by their five to seven lobed petals. Gentiana prostrata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
