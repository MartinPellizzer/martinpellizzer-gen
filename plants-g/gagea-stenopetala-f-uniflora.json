    "intro": "Gagea stenopetala f. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower gagea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It features a compact, grass-like foliage composed of narrow, grass-green leaves. The plant produces a single, bell-shaped flower with white to pale blue petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its bulbs are small and rounded, with a fibrous root system adapted to rocky soils. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens due to its delicate appearance."
