It is characterized by its broad, oblong-shaped leaves that are often leathery in texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible fruits resembling small, green apples. The fruit contains a single seed, which is encased in a hard shell and is the source of the plant's commercial value. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional and economic benefits."
