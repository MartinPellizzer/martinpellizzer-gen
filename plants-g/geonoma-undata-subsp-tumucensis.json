    "intro": "Geonoma undata subsp. tumucensis, commonly known as the Tumucensis fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brownish, velvety moss, which helps in water retention. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
