    "intro": "Glycine clandestina var. sericea, commonly known as the silverleaf sweet pea, is a climbing legume native to the southwestern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant, pink to lilac flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil also makes it beneficial for improving soil fertility."
