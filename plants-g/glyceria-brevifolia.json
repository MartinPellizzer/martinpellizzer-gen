    "intro": "Glyceria brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It typically grows in dense clusters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Glyceria brevifolia is adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its rhizomes help in nutrient cycling and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
