    "intro": "Geissois pruinosa var. intermedia, commonly known as the roughleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often used in native plant gardens."
