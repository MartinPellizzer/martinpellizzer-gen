    "intro": "Galinsoga spellenbergii, commonly known as the common gall of the sunflower, is an annual herb native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender stems, opposite leaves with serrated edges, and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces tiny, oval-shaped fruits called cypselae, which are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to compete with crops, it is considered a weed in many regions."
