    "intro": "Gonzalea cornifolia, commonly known as the horned fern, is a striking plant characterized by its unique, branching fronds that resemble horns. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's foliage consists of compound leaves that are often waxy and leathery, providing a distinctive texture. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the undersides of its fronds. Gonzalea cornifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and air-purifying qualities."
