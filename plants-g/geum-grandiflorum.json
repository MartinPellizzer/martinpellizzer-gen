    "intro": "Geum grandiflorum, commonly known as the showy mountain avens, is a North American native plant belonging to the rose family (Rosaceae). It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has basal leaves that are palmately lobed. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it an important species in ecological gardens."
