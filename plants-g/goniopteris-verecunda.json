    "intro": "Goniopteris verecunda, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its fronds are composed of a complex arrangement of pinnae, which are small, lance-shaped leaflets. Goniopteris verecunda plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various organisms."
