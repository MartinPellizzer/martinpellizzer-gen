    "intro": "Gnaphalium mutabile, commonly known as the variable cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, often forming dense mats. Its small, white to pinkish flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Gnaphalium mutabile is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
