    "intro": "Goniophlebium glaucophyllum, commonly known as the blue-veined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that display a striking blue-green hue, especially on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Goniophlebium glaucophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
