    "intro": "Gomphocarpus marginatus, commonly known as the purple milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple-tinged margin. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Gomphocarpus marginatus is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
