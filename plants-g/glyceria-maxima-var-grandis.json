    "intro": "Glyceria maxima var. grandis, commonly known as the tall glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands that provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
