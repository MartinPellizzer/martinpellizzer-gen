    "intro": "Gentiana pseudosquarrosa subsp. pseudosquarrosa, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
