    "intro": "Guzmania wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange. The plant features a rosette of grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small animals. Its roots are adapted for absorbing nutrients from the air and decaying organic matter rather than soil. Guzmania wrightii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush appearance."
