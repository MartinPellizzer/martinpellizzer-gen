    "intro": "Geranium yesoense var. hakusanense, commonly known as the Yesso geranium, is a rare flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pinkish-red flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky slopes. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
