    "intro": "Gibbaeum gibbosum, commonly known as the mountain zebra plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features distinctive, fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are usually small and spiny, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Gibbaeum gibbosum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
