    "intro": "Grammitis spongiosa, commonly known as the sponge moss, is a species of liverwort that belongs to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, spongy growth habit, with leafy shoots that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Its leaves are usually small, ovate, and closely appressed to the stem, contributing to its overall dense appearance. Grammitis spongiosa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention."
