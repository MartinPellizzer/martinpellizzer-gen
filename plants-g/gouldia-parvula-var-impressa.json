    "intro": "Gouldia parvula var. impressa, commonly known as the pink gouldia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically a vibrant pink to red hue, which intensify in color under full sun. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water once established, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to add a splash of color to coastal or Mediterranean-style landscapes."
