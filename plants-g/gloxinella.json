These plants are characterized by their velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Gloxinella species are typically herbaceous, with some growing as shrubs or climbers. They thrive in warm, humid environments and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The genus is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation indoors."
