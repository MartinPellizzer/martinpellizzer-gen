    "intro": "Gonolobus biflorus var. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's two-flowered go-nola, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Leguminosae, also known as the legume or bean family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist, sandy soils. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds, which are dispersed by water or wind. This species is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its adaptation to wetland environments."
