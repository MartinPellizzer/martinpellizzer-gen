It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in several conservation areas."
