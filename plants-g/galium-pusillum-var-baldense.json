    "intro": "Galium pusillum var. baldense, commonly known as the bald mountain bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, three-lobed berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the cool, humid climates of its native habitat."
