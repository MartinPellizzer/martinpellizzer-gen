    "intro": "Gagea arvensis f. bulbillifera, commonly known as the bulbil-bearing field scilla, is a botanical variant of the field scilla. It is a bulbous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers. One distinguishing characteristic is the presence of bulblets, which are small, vegetative propagules that form along the flower stems. This form is notable for its ability to reproduce vegetatively, enhancing its survival in disturbed or marginal habitats."
