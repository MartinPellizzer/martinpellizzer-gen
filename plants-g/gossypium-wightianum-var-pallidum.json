    "intro": "Gossypium wightianum var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale cotton bush, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, pale pink to white flowers. The plant produces fluffy, white cotton-like fibers that are harvested for textile use, though it is less commercially significant than other cotton species. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and agricultural studies in its native regions."
