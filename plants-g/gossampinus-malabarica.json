    "intro": "Gossampinus malabarica, commonly known as the Malabar chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
