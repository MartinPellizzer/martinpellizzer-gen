    "intro": "Goniopteris fraxinifolia, commonly known as the ash-leaf fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its large, frond-like leaves. The plant features compound leaves with a distinctive, palmately divided structure, resembling the leaves of ash trees. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream sides, where it thrives in high humidity. The fronds are usually dark green and may have a leathery texture, with sporangia borne on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
