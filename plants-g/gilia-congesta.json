It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Gilia congesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
