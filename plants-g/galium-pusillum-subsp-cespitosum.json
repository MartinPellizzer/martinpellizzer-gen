    "intro": "Galium pusillum subsp. cespitosum, commonly known as the creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. The plant has thin, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
