These plants are native to coastal regions of the Americas and are adapted to saline environments. They typically have showy, hibiscus-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The leaves are usually palmately lobed, and the plants often grow as shrubs or small trees. Gibbesia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh coastal conditions."
