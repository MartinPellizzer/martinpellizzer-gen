    "intro": "Gleditsia japonica var. purpurea, commonly known as the Japanese honeylocust, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its compound leaves that turn a striking red-purple color in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal."
