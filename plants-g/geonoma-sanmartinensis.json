    "intro": "Geonoma sanmartinensis, commonly known as the San Mart\u00edn fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomorphs, which help in nutrient absorption. The San Mart\u00edn fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
