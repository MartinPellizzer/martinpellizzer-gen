    "intro": "Gilia trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, bright pink or red flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and opposite, with a slightly hairy texture. This species is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, rocky areas, and along streambanks. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
