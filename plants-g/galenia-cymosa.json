    "intro": "Galenia cymosa, commonly known as the clustered galena or red sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features fleshy, ribbed stems and produces small, clustered yellow flowers. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss. Galenia cymosa is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
