    "intro": "Goodyera \u00d7 tamnaensis, commonly known as the hybrid lady's slipper orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Goodyera velutina and Goodyera robusta. It is a terrestrial orchid with a creeping rhizome system and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces showy, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories across parts of Asia. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
