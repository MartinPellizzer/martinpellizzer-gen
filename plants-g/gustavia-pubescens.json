    "intro": "Gustavia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy hibiscus, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Gustavia pubescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, coastal environments."
