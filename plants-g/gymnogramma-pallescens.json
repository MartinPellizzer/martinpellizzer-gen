    "intro": "Gymnogramma pallescens, commonly known as the pale gymnogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Gymnogramma pallescens has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots along their length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
