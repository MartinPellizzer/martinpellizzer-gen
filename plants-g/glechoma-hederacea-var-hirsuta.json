    "intro": "Glechoma hederacea var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. It spreads through stolons, forming dense mats that can colonize lawns and disturbed soils. This variety is particularly hardy and thrives in moist, shaded environments."
