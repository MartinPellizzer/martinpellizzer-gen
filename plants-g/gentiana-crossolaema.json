It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, known for its showy blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are characterized by their five to seven petals and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
