It is characterized by its compact, globular inflorescences that are typically red or pink in color, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are clustered together, forming a dense, spherical shape. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Gomphrena schultesia is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
