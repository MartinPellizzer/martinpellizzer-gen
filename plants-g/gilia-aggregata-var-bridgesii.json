    "intro": "Gilia aggregata var. bridgesii, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas."
