    "intro": "Gymnorebutia neocumingii, commonly known as the Neocuming's Gymnorebutia, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a small, spiny plant with a short, thick stem and produces yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, well-drained soils. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid conditions. Gymnorebutia neocumingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
