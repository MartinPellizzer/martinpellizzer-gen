    "intro": "Gomphocarpus cristatus, commonly known as the Crowned Milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, spiny stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces distinctive, crown-shaped seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance."
