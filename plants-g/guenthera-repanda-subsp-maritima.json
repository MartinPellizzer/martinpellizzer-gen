    "intro": "Guenthera repanda subsp. maritima, commonly known as the coastal guenthera, is a flowering plant native to sandy coastal areas. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has adapted to salt spray and well-drained soils, making it resilient in harsh maritime environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting hairs. This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
