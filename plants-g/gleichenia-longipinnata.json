    "intro": "Gleichenia longipinnata, commonly known as the long-pinnate maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with elongated pinnae and small, rounded pinnules. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense mats, contributing to its ability to colonize various habitats. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a consistent green appearance throughout the year."
