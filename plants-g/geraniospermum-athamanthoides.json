It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its succulent leaves and showy, pink or red flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its water-storing tissues and reduced leaf surface. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
