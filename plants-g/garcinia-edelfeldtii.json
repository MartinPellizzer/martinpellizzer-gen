    "intro": "Garcinia edelfeldtii, commonly known as the Malabar tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by sour-scented, orange-red fruits. The fruits contain a single large seed enclosed in a thick, fleshy pulp, which is used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. Garcinia edelfeldtii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
