    "intro": "Gentiana fastigiata, commonly known as the tall gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. Gentiana fastigiata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
