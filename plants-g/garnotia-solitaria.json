    "intro": "Garnotia solitaria, commonly known as the solitary garnet, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking red, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and features lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. Its unique coloration and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
