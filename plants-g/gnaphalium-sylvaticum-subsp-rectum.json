It is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers and linear, often hairy leaves. This subspecies is typically found in moist meadows and woodland edges across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. Its aromatic foliage and resilience make it a notable component of its native ecosystems."
