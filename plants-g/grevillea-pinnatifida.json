    "intro": "Grevillea pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grevillea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically green with a slight blue or grey hue on the underside. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in dense, cylindrical clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Grevillea pinnatifida is also valued for its ability to attract native birds and insects."
