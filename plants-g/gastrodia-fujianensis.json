    "intro": "Gastrodia fujianensis, commonly known as the Fujian ginseng, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the mountainous regions of Fujian Province in China. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its fleshy, tuberous roots and lack of true leaves, relying instead on its underground structures for photosynthesis. The plant produces a single, erect stem with a single flower, typically white or pale yellow, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and protected in several regions."
