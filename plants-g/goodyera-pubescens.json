    "intro": "Goodyera pubescens, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, glossy, and hairy leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on trees or rocks. Its fronds are typically dark green with a velvety texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori. Goodyera pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
