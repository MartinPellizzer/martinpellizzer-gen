    "intro": "Grammitis govidjoaensis, commonly known as the Govejoa fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock faces or in crevices within the forest canopy. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change."
