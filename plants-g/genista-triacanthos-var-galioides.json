It is characterized by its dense growth habit and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces pods that contain seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control."
