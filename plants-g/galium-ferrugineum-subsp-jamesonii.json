    "intro": "Galium ferrugineum subsp. jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, rusty-colored hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
