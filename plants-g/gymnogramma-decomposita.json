    "intro": "Gymnogramma decomposita, commonly known as the decomposed fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Gymnogramma decomposita is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
