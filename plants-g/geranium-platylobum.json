    "intro": "Geranium platylobum, commonly known as the broad-leaf geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
