    "intro": "Gagea pusilla var. hortensis, commonly known as the dwarf spring beauty, is a small, perennial bulbous plant native to North America. It features delicate, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils and prefers partial to full shade. It is often found in woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Due to its low-growing habit and early blooming period, it is a charming addition to rock gardens and shaded borders."
