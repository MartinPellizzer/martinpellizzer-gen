    "intro": "[WRONG START] Gelonia occidentale, commonly known as the western gelonia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Gelonia occidentale is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
