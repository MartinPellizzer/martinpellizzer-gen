It is characterized by its woody stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a rough texture and a slightly hairy surface. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, Grewiopsis species are often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. These plants are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
