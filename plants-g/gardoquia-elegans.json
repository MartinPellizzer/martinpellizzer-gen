    "intro": "Gardoquia elegans, commonly known as the elegant gardoquia, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to purple, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage consists of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Gardoquia elegans thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
