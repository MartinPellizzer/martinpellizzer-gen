    "intro": "Geum canescens, commonly known as the hoary buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features showy yellow flowers with a distinctive white-pubescent appearance, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods, meadows, and rocky areas. Geum canescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
