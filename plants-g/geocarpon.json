    "intro": "Geocarpon, commonly known as the ghost fungus or ghost mushroom, is a genus of fungi that belongs to the family Geoglossaceae. These fungi are characterized by their unique, irregular-shaped, and often pale-colored fruiting bodies that resemble small, ghostly shapes. Geocarpon species are typically found in forest soils, where they play a role in decomposing organic matter. They are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with the roots of various plants, particularly in temperate and subtropical regions. Due to their elusive appearance and habitat, they are often overlooked in ecological studies despite their ecological significance."
