    "intro": "Geonoma euspatha, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
