    "intro": "Gentiana amarella subsp. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils, often in bogs or heathlands, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environment."
