    "intro": "Grammitis assurgens, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a unique texture. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis assurgens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be cultivated in greenhouses or shaded outdoor gardens."
