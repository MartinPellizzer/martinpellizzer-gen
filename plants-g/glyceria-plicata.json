    "intro": "Glyceria plicata, commonly known as the narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It features slender, erect stems that often grow in dense clusters, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Glyceria plicata thrives in saturated soils and is often found in association with other wetland plants. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
