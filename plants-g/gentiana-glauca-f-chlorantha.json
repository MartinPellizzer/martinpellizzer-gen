    "intro": "Gentiana glauca f. chlorantha, commonly known as the blue gentian, is a variant of the gentian species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. This perennial herb is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The botanical features of this plant make it a notable species in botanical gardens and wildflower habitats."
