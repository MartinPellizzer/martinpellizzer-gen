    "intro": "Gesneria humilis subsp. celsioides, commonly known as the Celsioides gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among succulent and bromeliad enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
