    "intro": "Glandularia longidentata, commonly known as the long-toothed verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its glandular leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are often covered in fine, hair-like glands that secrete oils, which may help deter herbivores. The flowers, which range in color from purple to pink, bloom in late spring to early summer."
