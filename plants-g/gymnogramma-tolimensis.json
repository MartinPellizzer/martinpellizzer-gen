    "intro": "Gymnogramma tolimensis, commonly known as the Tolima gymnogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Gymnogramma tolimensis is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Colombia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or along stream banks."
