    "intro": "Galium chaetophorum, commonly known as hairy bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule containing several seeds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium chaetophorum is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through both vegetative growth and seed dispersal."
