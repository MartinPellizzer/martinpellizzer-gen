    "intro": "Goniopteris calypso, commonly known as the Calypso water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its fronds are divided into small, lance-shaped segments, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems."
