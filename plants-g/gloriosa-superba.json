    "intro": "Gloriosa superba, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a striking climbing plant native to India and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant features heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces yellow-orange berries that contain toxic seeds. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its natural habitat. Gloriosa superba is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its traditional medicinal uses."
