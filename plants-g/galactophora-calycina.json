    "intro": "Galactophora calycina, commonly known as the yellow star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Colchicaceae and is characterized by its showy, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, waxy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its flowering stems rise above the foliage, bearing clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Galactophora calycina is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and easy care requirements."
