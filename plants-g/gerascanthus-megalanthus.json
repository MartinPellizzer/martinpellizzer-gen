It is characterized by its large, showy, tubular flowers that range in color from fiery red to deep orange, often with contrasting yellow or white markings. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with lance-shaped, opposite leaves. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, and it thrives in full sun with well-drained soil.
