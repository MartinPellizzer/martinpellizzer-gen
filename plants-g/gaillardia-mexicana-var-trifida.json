    "intro": "Gaillardia mexicana var. trifida, commonly known as the Mexican tawny coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and red ray florets surrounding a central yellow disk, giving it a striking, daisy-like appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in xeriscaping."
