    "intro": "Guzmania delicatula, commonly known as the pink guzmania, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that often displays shades of pink, red, and orange, surrounded by colorful bracts. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, water-holding cup at the center. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Guzmania delicatula thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush, tropical appearance."
