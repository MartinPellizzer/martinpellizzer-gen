    "intro": "Guadua uncinata, commonly known as the Andean bamboo, is a tall, fast-growing grass native to South America. It is characterized by its strong, hollow stems that can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The plant has a dense network of rhizomes that allow it to spread rapidly and form extensive clumps. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a slightly rough texture. Guadua uncinata is highly valued for its use in construction and as a sustainable alternative to timber."
