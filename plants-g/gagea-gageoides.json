    "intro": "Gagea gageoides, commonly known as the mountain gagea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, rounded bulbs that serve as its primary storage organs, allowing it to survive in harsh, alpine or rocky environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or woodland settings. Gagea gageoides is also notable for its early spring blooming habit, often emerging before many other spring-flowering plants."
