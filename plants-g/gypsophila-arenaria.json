    "intro": "Gypsophila arenaria, commonly known as the desert sandpink, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Gypsophila arenaria is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to grow in challenging conditions."
