It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can grow up to 15 meters in height, making it a valuable resource for construction and handicrafts. The plant has a robust root system that helps prevent soil erosion, contributing to its ecological importance. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth texture and a slightly fibrous structure.
