    "intro": "Glyceria aquatica, commonly known as water glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. Glyceria aquatica is often found in shallow water or moist soil, contributing to the ecological stability of its habitat. It is valued for its ability to prevent erosion and support aquatic biodiversity."
