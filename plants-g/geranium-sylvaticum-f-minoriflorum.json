    "intro": "Geranium sylvaticum f. minoriflorum, commonly known as the lesser woodland geranium, is a flowering plant in the family Geraniaceae. It is a compact perennial herb with upright stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The leaves are palmately lobed, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its woodland habitat. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. It is often used in native plant gardens to support local pollinators and enhance biodiversity."
