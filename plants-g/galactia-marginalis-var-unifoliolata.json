    "intro": "Galactia marginalis var. unifoliolata, commonly known as the single leaf galactia, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is known for its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are unique in that they are unifoliolate, meaning each leaf is a single leaflet, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Galactia. This plant is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a forage species for livestock."
