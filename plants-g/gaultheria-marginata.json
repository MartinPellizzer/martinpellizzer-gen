    "intro": "Gaultheria marginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous areas. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals. Its leaves are elliptical with a serrated margin and emit a faint wintergreen scent when crushed. Gaultheria marginata is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of methyl salicylate in its leaves."
