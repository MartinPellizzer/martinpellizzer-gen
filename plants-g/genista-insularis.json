    "intro": "Genista insularis, commonly known as the island broom, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and needle-like leaves, which are typical of the Genista genus. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
