    "intro": "Galearis spectabilis f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered pinkroot, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and clusters of pale white or cream-colored flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a distinctive, ribbed fruit. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
