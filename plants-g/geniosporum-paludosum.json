    "intro": "Geniosporum paludosum, commonly known as the swamp gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a rough texture, while its stems are erect and can reach heights of up to 2 feet. Geniosporum paludosum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil with its extensive root system."
