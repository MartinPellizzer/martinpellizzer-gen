    "intro": "Gongrodiscus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It features large, broad leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant has a unique ability to trap air within its thick, spongy petioles, allowing it to remain afloat. Its flowers are showy, with bright yellow petals and a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Gongrodiscus plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water oxygenation."
