    "intro": "Gentiana orfordii, commonly known as the Orford's gentian, is a striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its deep blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in subalpine or alpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Gentiana orfordii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
