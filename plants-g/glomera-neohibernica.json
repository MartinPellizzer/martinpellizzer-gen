    "intro": "Glomera neohibernica, commonly known as the Silverleaf Nightshade, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Scottish Highlands. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and small, star-shaped purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
