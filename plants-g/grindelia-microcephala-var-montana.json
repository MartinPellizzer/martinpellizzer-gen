    "intro": "Grindelia microcephala var. montana, commonly known as mountain gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and silver-green foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh native environment."
