    "intro": "Gymnotrix domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and smooth, glandular leaves. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
