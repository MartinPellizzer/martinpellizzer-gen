    "intro": "Grindelia stricta var. aestuarina, commonly known as saltbush or coastal gumplant, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to saline and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. Its aromatic leaves contain compounds that have been used traditionally by indigenous peoples. This variety is closely related to other members of the Asteraceae family, sharing similar structural and reproductive features."
