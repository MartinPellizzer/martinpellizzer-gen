It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often with a white throat. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem. The showy gilia is an important nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
