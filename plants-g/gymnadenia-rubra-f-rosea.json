    "intro": "Gymnadenia rubra f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered green gentian, is a rare and striking variant of the green gentian. It is characterized by its distinctive pinkish-red floral hues, which set it apart from the typical greenish flowers of the species. The plant is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe, particularly in moist meadows and woodland edges. It produces tall, slender stems with whorled leaves and blooms in late summer. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after addition to specialized gardens and botanical collections."
