    "intro": "Gentianella austriaca f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered gentian, is a rare and striking plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its small, bright white flowers that contrast sharply with its deep green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
