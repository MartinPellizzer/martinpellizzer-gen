    "intro": "Gastonia emirnensis, commonly known as the Emirnensis gastonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a rough texture, while its flowers are often white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gastonia emirnensis is considered a vulnerable species."
