    "intro": "Goodyera waitziana, commonly known as the fairy slipper or ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white leaves and its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and is often found in association with mosses and other epiphytic plants. Goodyera waitziana is a rare and endangered species, with limited geographic distribution and specific habitat requirements. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and conservationists."
