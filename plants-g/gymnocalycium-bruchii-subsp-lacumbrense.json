    "intro": "Gymnocalycium bruchii subsp. lacumbrense, commonly known as the lacumbrense moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, ribbed stems. The plant produces striking, colorful flowers that are typically yellow or orange, which bloom in the evening. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with spines that provide protection and reduce water loss. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
