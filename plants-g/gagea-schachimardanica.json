    "intro": "Gagea schachimardanica, commonly known as the Schachimardan lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Armenia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Its bulbs are small and serve as the primary means of vegetative propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
