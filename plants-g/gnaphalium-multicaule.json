It typically features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, branched clusters called cymes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Gnaphalium multicaule is known for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
