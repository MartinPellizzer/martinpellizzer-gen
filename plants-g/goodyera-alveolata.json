    "intro": "Goodyera alveolata, commonly known as the bubble-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, bubble-like structures called tubercles. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded forest floors and is often found in association with other epiphytic and terrestrial orchids. Goodyera alveolata is an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
