    "intro": "Geranium leptodactylon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or red, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
