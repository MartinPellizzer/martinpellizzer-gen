It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
