    "intro": "Gonocormus nitidulus, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually smooth and hairless. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered in dense spikes, often producing pale yellow or greenish blooms."
