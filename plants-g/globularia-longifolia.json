    "intro": "Globularia longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved globularia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, globe-like shape and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant has succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Globularia longifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
