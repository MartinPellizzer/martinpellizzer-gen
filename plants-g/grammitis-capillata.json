    "intro": "Grammitis capillata, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often described as feathery or lacy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the substrate. Grammitis capillata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens or as a houseplant."
