    "intro": "Gratiola graniticola, commonly known as the granite bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to regions with rocky, fast-flowing waters. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor environments, where it relies on these bladders for sustenance. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, adapted to minimize resistance in flowing water. Gratiola graniticola plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its habitat by contributing to the food web and stabilizing sediment."
