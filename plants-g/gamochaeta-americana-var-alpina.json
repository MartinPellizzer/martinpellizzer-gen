    "intro": "Gamochaeta americana var. alpina, commonly known as alpine blueweed, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
