    "intro": "Gahnia leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-stemmed tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally waterlogged soils, often found in swampy areas or along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while the stems are hollow and sturdy. Gahnia leucocarpa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
