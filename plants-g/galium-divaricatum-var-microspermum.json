    "intro": "Galium divaricatum var. microspermum, commonly known as the small-seeded bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant features slender stems that are often prostrate or ascending, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces tiny, bladder-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. The variety microspermum is distinguished by its smaller, more delicate seeds compared to other varieties of Galium divaricatum."
