It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that reflect light, giving it a shiny appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Gumira lucidula is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
