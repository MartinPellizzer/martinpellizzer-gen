    "intro": "Galinsoga, commonly known as beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of tiny yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant is native to the Americas but has been naturalized in many parts of the world, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Galinsoga has serrated leaves and produces seeds that are easily dispersed by wind. It is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various environments."
