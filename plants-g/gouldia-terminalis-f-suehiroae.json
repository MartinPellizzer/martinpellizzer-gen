    "intro": "Gouldia terminalis f. suehiroae, commonly known as the Suehiroae form of the Gouldia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens or container planting due to its compact size and drought tolerance. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with minimal water."
