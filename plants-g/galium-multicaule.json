    "intro": "Galium multicaule, commonly known as common bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Galium multicaule is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in woodland edges, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
