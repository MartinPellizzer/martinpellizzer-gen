    "intro": "Gesneria bulbosa var. lateritia, commonly known as the lateritia gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the humid lowland forests of Central and South America. It features broad, ovate leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a waxy texture, often adorned with subtle variegation. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation and terrariums."
