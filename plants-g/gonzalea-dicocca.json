    "intro": "Gonzalea dicocca, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red or pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves are typical of many desert plants. Gonzalea dicocca is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
