    "intro": "Galium saxosum, commonly known as the rock bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its adaptability to harsh, nutrient-poor soils makes it a common sight in mountainous regions. Galium saxosum plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas and provides habitat for various insect species."
