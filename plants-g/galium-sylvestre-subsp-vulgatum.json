    "intro": "Galium sylvestre subsp. vulgatum, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It features slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground, and its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is known for its edible leaves, though they should be consumed in moderation."
