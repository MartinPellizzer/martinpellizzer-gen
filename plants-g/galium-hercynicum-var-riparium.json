    "intro": "Galium hercynicum var. riparium, commonly known as water bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to wetland and riparian habitats in Europe. It features slender, ascending stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats along water edges. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. This variety is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil along riverbanks and other aquatic margins."
