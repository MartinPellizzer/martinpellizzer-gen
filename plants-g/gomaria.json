    "intro": "Gomaria, commonly known as the Indian nettle or *Urtica dioica* var. *indica*, is a flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its stinging hairs on the leaves and stems, which release irritants when touched. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and is native to parts of Asia, including India. Gomaria has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
