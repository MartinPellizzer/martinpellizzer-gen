    "intro": "Geniostoma antherotrichum var. archboldianum, commonly known as the Florida antherotrichum, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
