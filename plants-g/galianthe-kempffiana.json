    "intro": "Galianthe kempffiana, commonly known as the Kempffiana orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich substrates to flourish. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat destruction, it is also considered vulnerable in its natural range."
