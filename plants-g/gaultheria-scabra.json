    "intro": "Gaultheria scabra, commonly known as the rough strawberry shrub, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, commonly known as the heath family, and is characterized by its dense, woody growth habit. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or orange in color, with a tangy, slightly acidic flavor. Gaultheria scabra thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and covered in fine, rough hairs, contributing to its common name."
