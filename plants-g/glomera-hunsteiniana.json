    "intro": "Glomera hunsteiniana, commonly known as the Himalayan glomera, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy inflorescences. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a distinctive central yellow gland. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Due to its habitat in alpine regions, it is adapted to cold temperatures and poor soil conditions."
