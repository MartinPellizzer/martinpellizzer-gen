    "intro": "Gymnema spirei, commonly known as the Indian nettle or gymnema, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of India and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is notable for containing gymnemic acids, which have been studied for their potential to reduce sugar absorption in the intestines. Gymnema spirei is often cultivated for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine. Its unique ability to inhibit sweet taste makes it a subject of interest in research related to diabetes management."
