    "intro": "Garnotia variyamensis, commonly known as the Varikam Mountain Gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Garnotia variyamensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
