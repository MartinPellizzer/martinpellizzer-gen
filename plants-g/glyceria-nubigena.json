    "intro": "Glyceria nubigena, commonly known as cloud sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or saturated soil, forming dense, tussock-like clumps. The plant has slender, triangular stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green in color. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Glyceria nubigena plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
