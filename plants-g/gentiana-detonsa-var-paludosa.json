    "intro": "Gentiana detonsa var. paludosa, commonly known as the bog gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in northern Europe. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine down, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils. It is often found in peat bogs and other damp environments where competition from other plants is minimal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
