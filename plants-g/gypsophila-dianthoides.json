    "intro": "Gypsophila dianthoides, commonly known as the desert sandcatcher, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration. Gypsophila dianthoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
