    "intro": "Gunnera magellanica, commonly known as the Andes giant rhubarb, is a striking perennial plant native to the southern Andes. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, with a thick, waxy surface. The plant produces tall, spiky flower stalks that bear small, greenish-white flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often cultivated for its dramatic foliage. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for water gardens and shaded borders."
