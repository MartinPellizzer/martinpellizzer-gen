    "intro": "Guzmania scherzeriana var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered torch plant, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that features a cluster of white flowers emerging from a central spadix, surrounded by colorful bracts. The plant possesses a rosette-shaped leaf structure that collects rainwater, creating a microhabitat for small aquatic organisms. Its foliage is typically green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements."
