    "intro": "Gagea szovitsii var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate gagea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
