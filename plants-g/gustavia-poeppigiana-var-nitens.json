    "intro": "Gustavia poeppigiana var. nitens, commonly known as the silverleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the year in suitable climates. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This ornamental plant is often cultivated for its striking foliage and vibrant floral display."
