    "intro": "Glyceria pungens, commonly known as spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and floodplains, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often clustered at the base, with long, narrow leaves that are usually hairless. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, two-lobed spikelets, which are arranged in a compact cluster. Glyceria pungens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
