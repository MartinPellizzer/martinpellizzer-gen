    "intro": "Gaultheria ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, giving them a shiny appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a tart, slightly sweet flavor. Gaultheria ferruginea is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and medicinal properties."
