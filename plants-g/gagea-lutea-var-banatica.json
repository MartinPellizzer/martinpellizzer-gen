It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, star-shaped yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. It is often found in woodland edges and open meadows. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for certain habitat types."
