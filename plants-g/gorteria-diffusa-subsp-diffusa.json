It features basal rosettes of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
