    "intro": "Glaucium corniculatum f. pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved glory flower, is a variant of the glaucium species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, pinnatifid (lobed) leaves and striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its foliage is often covered in a whitish, powdery coating, giving it a unique appearance. This ornamental plant is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
