    "intro": "Gossypium barbadense f. casimiranum, commonly known as the Casimiranum cotton, is a botanical variety of upland cotton native to South America. It is characterized by its long, fine fibers that are highly valued for their strength and softness. This variety typically grows in warm, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces fluffy bolls that contain the cotton fibers. Due to its genetic uniqueness, it is of interest in both agricultural research and horticultural cultivation."
