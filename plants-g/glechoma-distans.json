    "intro": "Glechoma distans, commonly known as creeping speedwell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a prostrate growth habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. Its leaves are heart-shaped, serrated, and covered in a fine white down, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Glechoma distans is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks."
