    "intro": "Goodyera gemmata, commonly known as the fairy slipper or ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and small, pale green or white flowers that resemble tiny slippers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common feature among orchids. Goodyera gemmata is a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and over-collection."
