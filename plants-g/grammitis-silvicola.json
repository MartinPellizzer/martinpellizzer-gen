It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Grammitis silvicola has a complex life cycle involving both sporophyte and gametophyte stages. Its small size and intricate structure make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
