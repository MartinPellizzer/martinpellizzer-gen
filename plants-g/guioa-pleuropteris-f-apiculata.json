    "intro": "Guioa pleuropteris f. apiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf guioa, is a rare and unique botanical variant within the Guioa genus. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed enclosed in a fibrous aril. This form is of particular interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and limited distribution in the Philippines."
