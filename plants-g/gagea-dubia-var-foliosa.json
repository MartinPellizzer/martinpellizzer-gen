    "intro": "Gagea dubia var. foliosa, commonly known as the broad-leaved gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of delicate, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its bulbs are relatively small and serve as storage organs, allowing the plant to survive harsh winter conditions. Gagea dubia var. foliosa is often found in open woodlands and alpine meadows, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
