    "intro": "Geranium pyrenaicum var. pumilum, commonly known as the Pyrenean geranium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a rough, textured surface that helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
