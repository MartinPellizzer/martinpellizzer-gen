    "intro": "Gentiana austriaca var. paludosa, commonly known as the Austrian gentian or bog gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, acidic habitats in Europe. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in wet meadows, bogs, and marshes, where it forms dense colonies. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for nutrient-poor, wet environments."
