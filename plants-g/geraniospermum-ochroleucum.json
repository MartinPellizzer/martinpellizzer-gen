It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in summer and attract various pollinators."
