It features a short, thick stem covered in spiny, cylindrical segments. The plant produces pale yellow to orange flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stem. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
