    "intro": "Gaultheria appressa, commonly known as the dwarf wax myrtle, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically reaches a height of 1 to 3 feet and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that ranges from dark green to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Gaultheria appressa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native habitat."
