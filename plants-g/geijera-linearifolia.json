    "intro": "Geijera linearifolia, commonly known as the slender-stemmed geijera, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed soils and along forest edges. Geijera linearifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
