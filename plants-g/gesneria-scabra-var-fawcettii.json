    "intro": "Gesneria scabra var. fawcettii, commonly known as the Fawcettii Gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features smooth, dark green, leathery leaves with a distinctive waxy texture and a slightly rough, scaly surface. The plant produces vibrant orange or red tubular flowers during the summer months, which attract hummingbirds and other pollinators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements in indoor and outdoor gardens."
