    "intro": "Galanthus reginae-olgae subsp. corcyrensis, commonly known as the Corcyrene snowdrop, is a rare and delicate bulbous plant native to the island of Corcyra (modern-day Corfu) in the Ionian Sea. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, nodding flowers with green markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland areas and has lance-shaped leaves that emerge in early spring. It is distinguished by its unique floral structure and is considered a rare species in cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
