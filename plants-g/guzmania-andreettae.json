    "intro": "Guzmania andreettae, commonly known as the Andreetta's bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that emerges from a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture in its natural habitat. Guzmania andreettae is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
