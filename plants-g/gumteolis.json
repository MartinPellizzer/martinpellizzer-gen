    "intro": "Gumteolis, commonly known as the golden gum tree, is a deciduous tree native to the subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its sap is viscous and has been traditionally used in local medicine for its purported healing properties. The plant is valued for both its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
