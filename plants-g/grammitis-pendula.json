    "intro": "Grammitis pendula, commonly known as the weeping fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous fronds that drape gracefully from its host, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant has a simple, non-vascular structure, with roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually slender and have a soft, feathery texture. Grammitis pendula prefers high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
