    "intro": "Gagea ramulosa, commonly known as the slender gagea, is a small bulbous perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Its bulbs are covered in a fibrous sheath and are adapted for storing nutrients, allowing the plant to survive in harsh environmental conditions. Gagea ramulosa plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and supporting local biodiversity."
