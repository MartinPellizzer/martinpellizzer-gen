    "intro": "Gaultheria hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy wax myrtle, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a tart, slightly sweet flavor. Gaultheria hirsuta is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
