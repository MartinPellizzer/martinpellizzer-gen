    "intro": "Goodyera brachystegia, commonly known as the short-stemmed lady's slipper, is a terrestrial orchid native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and unique, pouch-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical and subtropical forests. Goodyera brachystegia has a short rhizome and produces aerial roots that help it absorb moisture from the air. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
