    "intro": "Gnaphalium marcescens, commonly known as the sticky everlasting or winter everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its hairy, often sticky leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. The plant's ability to retain its dried foliage for long periods makes it a popular choice for dried floral arrangements."
