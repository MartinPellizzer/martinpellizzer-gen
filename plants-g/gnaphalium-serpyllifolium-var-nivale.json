It features tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often appearing as a fluffy mass. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Snow pearlweed is known for its ability to survive harsh conditions, making it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
