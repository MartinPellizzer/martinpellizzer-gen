It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Gynura dubia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
