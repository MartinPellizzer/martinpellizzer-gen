    "intro": "Glechoma camphorata, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer. The plant spreads via runners, forming dense mats that can cover the ground effectively. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its aromatic leaves contain compounds that give it a distinctive camphor-like scent."
