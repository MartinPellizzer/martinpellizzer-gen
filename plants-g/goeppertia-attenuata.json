    "intro": "Goeppertia attenuata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a member of the Marantaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a low-growing, rhizomatous plant characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with broad, lance-shaped leaves that display a mix of green, white, and silver markings. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive appearance and ease of care. Goeppertia attenuata is also known for its ability to purify indoor air, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
