It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind.
