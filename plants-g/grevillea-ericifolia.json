    "intro": "Grevillea ericifolia, commonly known as the heather-leaved grevillea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, heath-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Grevillea ericifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
