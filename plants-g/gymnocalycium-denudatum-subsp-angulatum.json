    "intro": "Gymnocalycium denudatum subsp. angulatum, commonly known as the angular moon cactus, is a cacti species native to northern South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is a succulent plant that stores water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
