    "intro": "Guarea tuberculata var. subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough-leafed guarea, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, rough, and often peeling bark, which gives it its scientific name. The leaves are alternate, simple, and typically have a leathery texture with prominent veins. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually greenish-yellow in color, followed by fruiting bodies that are woody and contain seeds. It is often found in lowland tropical rainforests and is valued for its hard, durable wood."
