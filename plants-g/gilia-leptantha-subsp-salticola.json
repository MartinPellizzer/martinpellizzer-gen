    "intro": "Gilia leptantha subsp. salticola, commonly known as the saltbush gilia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The species is adapted to thrive in saline conditions, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
