    "intro": "Globba racemosa, commonly known as the spathiphyllum ginger, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features tall, erect stems with whorled leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with pale green to yellow bracts that enclose small, clustered flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps in moist, shaded environments. Globba racemosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
