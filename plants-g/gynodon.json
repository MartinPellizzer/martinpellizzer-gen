    "intro": "Gynodon, commonly known as the \"false holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and the plant produces small, three-lobed fruits. Gynodon species are typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. These plants are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
