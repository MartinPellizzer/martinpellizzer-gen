    "intro": "Goniopteris forsteri, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Blechnaceae family. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust, unbranched trunk that supports the fronds, which are often covered in a thick, spongy layer of spore-producing structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate rainforests. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
