    "intro": "Gaylussacia ciliosa, commonly known as the small-fruited huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heaths and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by edible, bright red berries. Its leaves are elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often acidic and nutrient-poor habitats. Gaylussacia ciliosa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps."
