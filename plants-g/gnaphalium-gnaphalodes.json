    "intro": "Gnaphalium gnaphalodes, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Gnaphalium gnaphalodes is also known for producing a mild, aromatic scent, particularly when the leaves are crushed."
