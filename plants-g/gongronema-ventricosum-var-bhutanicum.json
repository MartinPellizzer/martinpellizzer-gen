    "intro": "Gongronema ventricosum var. bhutanicum, commonly known as the Bhutanese mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the high-altitude regions of Bhutan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest understories. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited study, its ecological role and conservation status remain poorly understood."
