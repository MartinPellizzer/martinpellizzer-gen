It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique vascular system, with two distinct vascular bundles in each leaf, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Grammitis bivascularis plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing microhabitats for various small organisms."
