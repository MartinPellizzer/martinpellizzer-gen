    "intro": "Gilia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate gilia, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It typically features slender, branching stems that lie close to the ground, often forming a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Gilia prostrata is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
