    "intro": "Gaura undulata, commonly known as whorled gaura, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its foliage is typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adding texture to the plant's appearance. Gaura undulata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
