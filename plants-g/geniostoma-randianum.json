It is characterized by its striking, velvety green leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a subtle red or purple tinge. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts who appreciate its unique appearance."
