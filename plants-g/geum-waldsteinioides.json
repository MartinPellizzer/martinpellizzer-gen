    "intro": "Geum waldsteinioides, commonly known as the Waldstein's avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate, often with a hairy texture, and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five sepals and petals that are usually shorter than the sepals. Geum waldsteinioides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
