    "intro": "Grammitis angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf lady fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a rosette formation. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
