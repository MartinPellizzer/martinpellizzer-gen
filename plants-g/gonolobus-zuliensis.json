    "intro": "Gonolobus zuliensis, commonly known as the Zuli morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heliotropic leaves that follow the sun's movement throughout the day. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its vines can grow up to several meters in length, often climbing or trailing along supports. The leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
