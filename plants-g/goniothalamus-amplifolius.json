    "intro": "Goniothalamus amplifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf goniothalamus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and leathery in texture. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruits are follicles that contain several seeds, and the tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
