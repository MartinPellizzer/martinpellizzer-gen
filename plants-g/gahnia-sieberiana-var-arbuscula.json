It typically grows in wetland and swampy environments, where it forms dense tussocks with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
