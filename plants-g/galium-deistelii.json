    "intro": "Galium deistelii, commonly known as the Deistel's bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds through wind and animals. Galium deistelii thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
