    "intro": "Gypsophila repens, commonly known as ice plant, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal. Gypsophila repens is also notable for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and full sun exposure."
