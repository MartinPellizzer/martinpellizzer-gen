    "intro": "Grammadenia aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange-flowered grammadenia, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the wet tropical forests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring and early summer. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Grammadenia aurantiaca thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation."
