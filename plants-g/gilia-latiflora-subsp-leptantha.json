    "intro": "Gilia latiflora subsp. leptantha, commonly known as the broadleaf gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This species thrives in rocky soils and open habitats, often found in desert or foothill regions. It plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its nectar-rich blooms."
