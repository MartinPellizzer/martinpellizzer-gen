    "intro": "Genista cappadocica, commonly known as Cappadocian broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by narrow, needle-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Genista cappadocica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in marginal habitats."
