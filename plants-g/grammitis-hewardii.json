    "intro": "Grammitis hewardii, commonly known as the Heward's spikemoss, is a member of the family Huperjiaceae and is native to New Zealand. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Grammitis hewardii is often found in montane and subalpine regions, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
