It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its distinctive appearance and drought tolerance make it an important component of desert ecosystems. It is also used in traditional medicine by some Native American tribes."
