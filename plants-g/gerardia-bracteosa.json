    "intro": "Gerardia bracteosa, commonly known as the golden gerardia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Gerardia bracteosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
