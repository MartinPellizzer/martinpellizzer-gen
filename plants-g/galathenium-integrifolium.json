    "intro": "Galathenium integrifolium, commonly known as the smoothleaf galathena, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its root system is fibrous, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and woodland edges. Galathenium integrifolium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
