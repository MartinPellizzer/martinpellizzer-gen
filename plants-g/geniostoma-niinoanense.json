    "intro": "Geniostoma niinoanense, commonly known as the Ni\u00f1o's geniostoma, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane rainforests. Its leaves are simple and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
