It is native to the mountainous regions of southern South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. These plants are evergreen shrubs characterized by their compact growth habit and dense foliage. The leaves are typically small, leathery, and arranged in whorls around the stem. Gongrothamnus species produce small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late summer to early autumn."
