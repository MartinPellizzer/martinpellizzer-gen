    "intro": "Grevillea miniata, commonly known as the pink mist grevillea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green, and its most notable characteristic is its clusters of bright pink, feathery flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of around 1 to 2 meters and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and drought conditions. Grevillea miniata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native birds and insects."
