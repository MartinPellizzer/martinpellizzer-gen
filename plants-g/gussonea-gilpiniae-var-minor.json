    "intro": "Gussonea gilpiniae var. minor, commonly known as the lesser gilpinia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, colorful inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat needs, it is considered a conservation concern."
