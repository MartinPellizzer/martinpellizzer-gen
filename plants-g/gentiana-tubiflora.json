    "intro": "Gentiana tubiflora, commonly known as the tubular gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which are typically tubular in shape and bloom in late summer. The plant grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or moist soils, and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually unbranched and somewhat woody at the base. Gentiana tubiflora is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
