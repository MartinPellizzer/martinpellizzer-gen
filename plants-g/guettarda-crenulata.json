    "intro": "Guettarda crenulata, commonly known as the silverleaf guettarda, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to various soil types and drought resistance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Guettarda crenulata is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
