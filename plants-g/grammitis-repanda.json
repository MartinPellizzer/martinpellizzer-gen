    "intro": "Grammitis repanda, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Grammitis repanda is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
