    "intro": "Galium tubiflorum, commonly known as the clustered bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, prostrate stems that often form dense mats, and it produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces, and its roots are fibrous and adapted to rocky or dry soils. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows, gravelly slopes, and woodland edges. Galium tubiflorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
