    "intro": "Gagea uliginosa var. soleimani, commonly known as the Persian spring beauty, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the floral diversity of high-altitude ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
