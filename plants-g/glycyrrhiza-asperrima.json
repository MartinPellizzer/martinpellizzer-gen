    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza asperrima, commonly known as the rough licorice, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its root, which contains glycyrrhizin, a compound used in traditional medicine. However, it is less commonly cultivated than other licorice species due to its harsh taste and specific growing requirements."
