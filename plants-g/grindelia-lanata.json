    "intro": "Grindelia lanata, commonly known as the woolly goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly coating of fine hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Grindelia lanata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments. It is also used in traditional medicine by some Native American tribes for its purported healing properties."
