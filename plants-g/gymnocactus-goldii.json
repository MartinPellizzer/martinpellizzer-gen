    "intro": "Gymnocactus goldii, commonly known as the golden cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green or yellowish in color, often adorned with white or yellow spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. Gymnocactus goldii is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure. It is relatively drought-tolerant, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
