    "intro": "Gaultheria macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible and have a spicy, peppery flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in temperate rainforests. Gaultheria macrocalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties."
