    "intro": "Grevillea paniculata, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, red or orange-pink inflorescences that resemble plumes, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in coastal areas and well-drained soils, and is well adapted to full sun and moderate to high rainfall. Grevillea paniculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
