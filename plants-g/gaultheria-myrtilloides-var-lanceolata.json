    "intro": "Gaultheria myrtilloides var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf wintergreen, is a perennial shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, evergreen leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by edible, bright red berries in the fall. These berries are rich in antioxidants and have a tart, slightly sweet flavor. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments."
