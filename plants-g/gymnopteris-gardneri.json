    "intro": "Gymnopteris gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread across forest floors. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive, almost grass-like appearance, and are typically green with a waxy coating. Gymnopteris gardneri thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coniferous forests."
