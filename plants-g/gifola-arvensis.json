    "intro": "Gifola arvensis, commonly known as field sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple-veined, and its yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant prefers moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, gardens, and along roadsides. It is known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. Gifola arvensis is also noted for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
