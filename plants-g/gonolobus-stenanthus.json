    "intro": "Gonolobus stenanthus, commonly known as the narrow-flowered go-on-loobus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small leaflets, and it is often found in moist, sandy soils in open woodlands. Gonolobus stenanthus is a relatively rare species, and its botanical study contributes to the understanding of plant diversity in the region."
