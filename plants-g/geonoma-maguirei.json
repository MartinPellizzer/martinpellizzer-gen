    "intro": "Geonoma maguirei, commonly known as the Guianan arrowroot, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. The plant has delicate, pinnate fronds that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. It produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Geonoma maguirei is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
