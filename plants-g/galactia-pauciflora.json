    "intro": "Galactia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hard pods containing several seeds, and it is adapted to survive in poor, sandy soils. Galactia pauciflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded environments."
