    "intro": "Guzmania butcheri, commonly known as the Butcher's Guzmania, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence, which typically displays shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small aquatic life. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment. Guzmania butcheri thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush appearance."
