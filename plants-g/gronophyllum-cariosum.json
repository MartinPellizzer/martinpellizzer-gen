    "intro": "Gronophyllum cariosum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, dark bark. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing small, hard seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature and slow growth, it is considered a valuable species for ecological restoration and has traditional uses in some indigenous communities."
