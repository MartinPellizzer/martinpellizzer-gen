    "intro": "Geum rivale f. interstylosum, commonly known as the slender wood avens, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist, shaded habitats in Europe. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in damp environments. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland settings. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique addition to native plant collections."
