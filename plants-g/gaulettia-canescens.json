    "intro": "Gaulettia canescens, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with five petals. Its leaves are generally hairy and grayish in appearance, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Gaulettia canescens is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient environments."
