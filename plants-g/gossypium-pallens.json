    "intro": "Gossypium pallens, commonly known as the pale cotton plant, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Mexico and Central America. The plant is characterized by its soft, pale-colored fibers that are harvested for textile use, though it is less commercially important than other cotton species. It typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and palmate leaves. The flowers are usually yellow or pink, and the plant produces capsules that contain fibrous seeds."
