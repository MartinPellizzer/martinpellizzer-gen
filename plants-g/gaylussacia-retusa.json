    "intro": "Gaylussacia retusa, commonly known as the red spruce, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its elongated, elliptic leaves that are typically red or reddish-brown when mature. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale green, which bloom in late spring. Its berries are dark blue to black and are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Gaylussacia retusa thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
