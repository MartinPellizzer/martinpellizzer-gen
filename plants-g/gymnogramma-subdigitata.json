    "intro": "Gymnogramma subdigitata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Gymnogramma subdigitata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
