    "intro": "Gladiolus nudus, commonly known as the naked gladiolus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its striking, single flower that typically blooms in shades of white or pale pink. The plant is notable for its unique structure, with a short, unbranched stem and a single, showy inflorescence that resembles a sword, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cool, dry climate to flourish. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
