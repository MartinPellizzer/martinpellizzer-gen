    "intro": "Gardenia taitensis f. genuina, commonly known as the Taiti gardenia, is a rare and highly valued cultivar native to the island of Taiti in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, egg-shaped leaves and its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant is evergreen and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively slow-growing, making it a sought-after specimen in tropical gardens. Due to its limited natural range and susceptibility to environmental stress, it is considered a delicate and challenging plant to grow outside its native habitat."
