It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetland areas. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly toothed margin. Its small, white to pale pink flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences and bloom in late spring to early summer.
