    "intro": "Gymnopteris vespertilio, commonly known as the evening fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Gymnopteris vespertilio reproduces via spores rather than seeds, with the spore-producing structures known as sori located on the underside of its fronds."
