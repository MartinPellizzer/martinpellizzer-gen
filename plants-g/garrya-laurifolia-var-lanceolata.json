    "intro": "Garrya laurifolia var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf holly-leaf tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lanceolate, glossy dark green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during late winter to early spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and native plant gardens."
