    "intro": "Grammadenia sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenis's grammatophyllum, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters, displaying a mix of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found on trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Grammadenia sintenisii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
