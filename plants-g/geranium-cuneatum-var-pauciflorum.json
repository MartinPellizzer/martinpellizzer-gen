    "intro": "Geranium cuneatum var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that are often hairy, with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom from late winter to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
