    "intro": "Goniophlebium someyae var. someyae, commonly known as the Someya's goniophlebium, is a rare and specialized fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
