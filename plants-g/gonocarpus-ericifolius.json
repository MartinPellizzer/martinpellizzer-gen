    "intro": "Gonocarpus ericifolius, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range."
