    "intro": "Gymnandra stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping gymnandra, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, producing horizontal stems that root at the nodes and form new plants. The plant typically has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white, followed by small, round fruits. Gymnandra stolonifera is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
