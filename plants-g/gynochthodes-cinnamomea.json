    "intro": "Gynochthodes cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a distinctive cinnamon-colored fiddlehead at the base. The plant has a short, horizontal rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fertile fronds. Gynochthodes cinnamomea thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
