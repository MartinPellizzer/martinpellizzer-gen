    "intro": "Gothofreda multicaulis, commonly known as the multi-stemmed ghost plant, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that appear almost ethereal under sunlight. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its stems are often branched, giving it a bushy appearance, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a fragile species that is difficult to cultivate outside its natural range."
