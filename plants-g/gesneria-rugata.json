    "intro": "Gesneria rugata, commonly known as the wrinkled gesneria, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria rugata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental leaves and relatively low maintenance requirements."
