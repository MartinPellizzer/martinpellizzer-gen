It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than a meter in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Goniopteris tristis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
