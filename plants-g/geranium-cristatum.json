    "intro": "Geranium cristatum, commonly known as the crested geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique, crinkled leaf surface gives it a whimsical appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Geranium cristatum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established."
