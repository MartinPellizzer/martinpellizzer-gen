    "intro": "Galeottia grandiflora, commonly known as the giant bellflower, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows up to 1.5 meters tall, with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are tubular and have a distinctive, bell-like shape, which is adapted for pollination by specific insects. Galeottia grandiflora is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is valued for its ornamental beauty in botanical gardens."
