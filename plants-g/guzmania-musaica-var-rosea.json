    "intro": "Guzmania musaica var. rosea, commonly known as the pink guzmania, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, rose-colored bracts that surround the central inflorescence, giving it a dramatic and showy appearance. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a natural reservoir for its epiphytic growth habit. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom from the center of the rosette and can last for several months. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements."
