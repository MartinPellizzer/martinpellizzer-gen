    "intro": "Gentianella glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are usually basal, opposite, and covered with glandular dots, giving it its common name. Gentianella glanduligera is often found in open grasslands and meadows, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
