    "intro": "Guajava alata, commonly known as the white guava, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to regular guavas but with a milder flavor. Its fruit is valued for its nutritional content, including vitamins and dietary fiber, and is often used in local cuisines. Guajava alata thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
