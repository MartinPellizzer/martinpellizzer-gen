    "intro": "Galium sylvestre var. scabrum, commonly known as rough wood-sorrel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and stems are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
