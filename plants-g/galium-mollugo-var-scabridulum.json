    "intro": "Galium mollugo var. scabridulum, commonly known as rough bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features prostrate or ascending stems that are covered in stiff, bristly hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
