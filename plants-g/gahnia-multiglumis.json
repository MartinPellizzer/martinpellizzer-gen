    "intro": "Gahnia multiglumis, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, with the flowers being small and inconspicuous. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Gahnia multiglumis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
