    "intro": "Gonolobus rotundus, commonly known as the roundleaf dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that twine around its hosts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and develops capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found growing on plants such as legumes and grasses. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
