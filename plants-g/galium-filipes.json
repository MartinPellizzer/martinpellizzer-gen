    "intro": "Galium filipes, commonly known as creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. Galium filipes is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
