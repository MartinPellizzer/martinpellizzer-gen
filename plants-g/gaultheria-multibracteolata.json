It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in temperate forests and high-altitude regions. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and have a distinctive waxy coating. Gaultheria multibracteolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties."
