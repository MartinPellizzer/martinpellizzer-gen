    "intro": "Geum calthifolium, commonly known as white avens, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and hairy, with a rosette structure that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its flowering period typically occurs in early to mid-summer, and it thrives in moist, shady woodland environments. Geum calthifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
