    "intro": "Gentiana jamesii f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered gentian, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, characterized by its vibrant blue or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale blue, bloom in late summer and early fall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
