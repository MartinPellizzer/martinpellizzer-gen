    "intro": "Globularia macrantha, commonly known as the Cape globularia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces small, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant has a globular or spherical shape, giving it its common name, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. The flowers bloom in spring and are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
