    "intro": "Galium obliquum subsp. obliquum, commonly known as zigzag wood-sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, ascending stems that often curve in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded, rich soils. Its botanical structure supports its role as a groundcover plant in ecological restoration projects."
