    "intro": "Galanthus alpinus, commonly known as the alpine snowdrop, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It produces delicate, nodding white flowers with a yellow-green stripe on the inner petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a bulb that stores nutrients for the next growing season. Galanthus alpinus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
