    "intro": "Gratiola, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their umbel-like inflorescences and aromatic, often hairy foliage. Gratiola species are typically found in moist, temperate regions and are known for their showy, yellow or white flowers. The leaves are usually palmately lobed, and the roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine. However, many species are toxic and should be handled with care."
