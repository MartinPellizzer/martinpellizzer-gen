    "intro": "Gagea bulbifera var. major, commonly known as the giant bulbous spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its clustered, bulbous underground storage organs that serve as nourishment for the plant. The plant produces erect, leafy stems that bear small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. Its foliage consists of basal, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. This species is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows."
