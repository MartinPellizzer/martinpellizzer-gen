    "intro": "Grisia neriifolia, commonly known as the black-leafed grisia, is a unique plant native to the humid tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking dark green, almost black foliage, which contrasts sharply with its pale, waxy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks in dense forest canopies. Its leaves are broad and leathery, designed to retain moisture in its high-humidity environment. Grisia neriifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
