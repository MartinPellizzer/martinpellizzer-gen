It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth habit and twining stems, which allow it to climb and cover supports. Its fruit is a slender pod containing several seeds, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade with well-drained soil. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
