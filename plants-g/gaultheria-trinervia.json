    "intro": "Gaultheria trinervia, commonly known as the evergreen wintergreen, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, peppery flavor. Gaultheria trinervia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
