    "intro": "Geranium pyrenaicum var. nemorosum, commonly known as the woodland geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, where it thrives in partially shaded to dappled light conditions. The plant features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pink to purple, clustered in umbels, and bloom from late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to support local pollinators in forest ecosystems."
