    "intro": "Galium constrictum var. riphaeum, commonly known as the riparian bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, shaded environments along stream banks and wetlands. It features slender, ascending stems that are often covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, with a slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Galium constrictum var. riphaeum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in riparian zones."
