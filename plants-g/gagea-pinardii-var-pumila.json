    "intro": "Gagea pinardii var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf gagea, is a small perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are typically borne on short, sturdy stalks. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
