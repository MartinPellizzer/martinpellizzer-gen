    "intro": "Gourliea spinosa, commonly known as the spinous gourliea, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, spiny leaves that provide a defensive mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological role. Gourliea spinosa is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions."
