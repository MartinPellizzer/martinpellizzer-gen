    "intro": "Gunnarella, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is a distinguishing botanical feature. The plants typically have woody stems and alternate, simple leaves that vary in shape depending on the species. Gunnarella species are often shrubs or small trees, and they produce small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. These plants are adapted to arid environments and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
