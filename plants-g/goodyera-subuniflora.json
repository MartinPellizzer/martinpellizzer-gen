    "intro": "Goodyera subuniflora, commonly known as the single-flower lady's slipper, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and a single, showy violet or purple flower that resembles a slipper. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in rich, humusy soil under forest canopies. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is known for its unique and intricate floral structure. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Goodyera subuniflora is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
