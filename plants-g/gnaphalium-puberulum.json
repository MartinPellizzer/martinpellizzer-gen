    "intro": "Gnaphalium puberulum, commonly known as the hairy everlasting, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant is typically found in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Its small, yellowish flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves gives it its common name, and it is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms."
