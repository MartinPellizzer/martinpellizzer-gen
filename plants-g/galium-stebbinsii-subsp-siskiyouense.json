    "intro": "Galium stebbinsii subsp. siskiyouense, commonly known as Siskiyou bedstraw, is a rare flowering plant native to the Siskiyou Mountains of northern California and southern Oregon. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
