    "intro": "Gagea foliosa var. ellyptica, commonly known as the elliptic leaf gagea, is a rare variant of the gagea plant native to specific regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
