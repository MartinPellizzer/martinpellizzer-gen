It is a woody vine characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, three-lobed capsule, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Gnetum campestre plays a role in its ecosystem as both a food source and a habitat for various organisms."
