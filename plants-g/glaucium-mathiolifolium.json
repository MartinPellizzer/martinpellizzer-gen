    "intro": "Glaucium mathiolifolium, commonly known as the purple milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish coating. Its flowers are typically pale purple or pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, and it produces capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Glaucium mathiolifolium is adapted to thrive in dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
