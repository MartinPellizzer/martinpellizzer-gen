    "intro": "Gnaphalium dimorphum, commonly known as the two-form everlasting flower, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces both ray and disk florets, which contribute to its daisy-like appearance. Gnaphalium dimorphum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
