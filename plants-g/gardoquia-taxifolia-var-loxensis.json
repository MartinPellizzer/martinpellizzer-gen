It is characterized by its elongated, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its rarity, it is often found in specific regions of Central Asia, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
