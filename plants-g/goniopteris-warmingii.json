    "intro": "Goniopteris warmingii, commonly known as the Warming's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant features a distinctive, shield-shaped rachis with prominent, tooth-like lobes along its edges. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the Dryopteridaceae family."
