    "intro": "Guzmania lepidota, commonly known as the velvet leaf bromeliad, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports microfauna. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, spiky flower stem that bears small, white flowers. Guzmania lepidota thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil."
