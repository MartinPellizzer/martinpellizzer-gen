    "intro": "Gasteranthus delphinioides, commonly known as the blue bell flower, is a striking member of the Onagraceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant blue or purple flowers that resemble small bells, which are highly attractive to pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows as an erect herb with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with a distinctive lower lip that aids in pollination. Gasteranthus delphinioides thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
