It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its aromatic leaves, which contain compounds used in traditional medicine."
