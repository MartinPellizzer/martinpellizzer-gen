    "intro": "Guadua refracta, commonly known as the refractive bamboo, is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a hollow, jointed structure typical of bamboos. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are usually green and slightly hairy on the underside. Its rhizomes are robust and capable of forming dense clumps, allowing it to thrive in moist, tropical environments. Guadua refracta is valued for its strong, lightweight culms, which are used in construction and handicrafts."
