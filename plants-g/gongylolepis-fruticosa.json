    "intro": "Gongylolepis fruticosa, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features dense, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the cooler months, which attract pollinators like bees and moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Gongylolepis fruticosa is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun."
