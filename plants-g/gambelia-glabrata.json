    "intro": "Gambelia glabrata, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Gambelia glabrata plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
