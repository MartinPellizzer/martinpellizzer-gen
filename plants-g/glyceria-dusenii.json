    "intro": "Glyceria dusenii, commonly known as the narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer. Glyceria dusenii is characterized by its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological value."
