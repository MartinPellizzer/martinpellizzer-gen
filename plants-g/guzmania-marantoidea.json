    "intro": "Guzmania marantoidea, commonly known as the red-tipped guzmania, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that typically displays red bracts with yellow or orange flowers. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports aquatic life. Its foliage is often variegated with silver and green tones, adding visual interest to its appearance. Guzmania marantoidea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush, tropical look."
