    "intro": "Gordonia obtusa, commonly known as the century plant, is a unique evergreen conifer native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and can live for over 200 years, though it does not flower until it is approximately 70 years old. The plant has a distinctive conical shape with thick, leathery foliage that provides dense shade. Its cones are small and clustered, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Despite its name, it is not related to the true century plant (Agave) and is more closely related to the cypress family."
