    "intro": "Gastrolobium subcordatum, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf wattle, is a low-growing shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, bright green leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. It is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for dryland gardens. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
