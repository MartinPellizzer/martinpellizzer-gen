    "intro": "Galactia brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Galactia brachypoda plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife, making it an important component of its native ecosystem."
