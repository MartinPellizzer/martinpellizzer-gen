    "intro": "Gomphichis cladotricha, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions."
