    "intro": "Gagea juliae, commonly known as the Sierra Valley gagea, is a small, bulbous perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands or meadows. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its bulbs are adapted to survive in cold, dry conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
