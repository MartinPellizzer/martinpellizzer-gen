It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, fragrant white or pink flowers. The plant produces elliptical, flat pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Glycine micrantha is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural systems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
