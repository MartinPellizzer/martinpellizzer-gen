    "intro": "Galega porrecta, commonly known as the creeping goat's rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and covered in fine hairs. Galega porrecta is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments."
