    "intro": "Gonolobus peruanus, commonly known as the Peruvian horned bean, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Peru. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, arid environments and has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, and the flowers are usually yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The seeds are enclosed in a hard, horn-shaped pod, which gives the plant its common name."
