    "intro": "Gaylussacia frondosa f. glaucophylla, commonly known as the glaucophyll form of the highbush blueberry, is a variant of the highbush blueberry native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive bluish-gray waxy coating on the leaves, which gives it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, dark blue berries in the summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, wooded areas. This form is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its potential for cultivation in blueberry gardens."
