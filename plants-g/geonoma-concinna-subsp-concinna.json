    "intro": "Geonoma concinna subsp. concinna, commonly known as the narrow-leafed geonoma, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that often form dense, low-growing mats. The fronds are typically dimorphic, with fertile and sterile leaves differing in shape and structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
