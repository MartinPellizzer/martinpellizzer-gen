    "intro": "Galium binifolium subsp. conforme, commonly known as the creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of North America. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
