    "intro": "Gutierrezia leucantha, commonly known as white galleta, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and shrublands, and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The yellow flowers bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
