    "intro": "Garcinia graminea, commonly known as the Malabar tamarind, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by elliptical, orange-red fruits containing a single seed. Its fruits are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Garcinia graminea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and fruit."
