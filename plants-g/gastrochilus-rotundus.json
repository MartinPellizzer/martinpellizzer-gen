It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers with a distinctive round lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The orchid's botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural and conservation purposes."
