    "intro": "Gymnadenia crassinervis, commonly known as the broad-veined gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, bearing opposite, lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, typically from July to September. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Gymnadenia crassinervis is a rare and protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
