    "intro": "Gymnadenia \u00d7 souppensis, commonly known as the hybrid marsh gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear showy blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic habitats such as bogs and wet meadows. It is a hybrid species, resulting from the cross between Gymnadenia conopsea and Gymnadenia clypeata. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
