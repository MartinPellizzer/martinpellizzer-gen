    "intro": "Gomphocarpus brevipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. Its milkweed sap contains latex, which is a characteristic feature of the Asclepiadaceae family. Gomphocarpus brevipes is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
