    "intro": "Gomphrena decumbens var. genuina, commonly known as the Mexican feather plant, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its distinctive, feathery bracts that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, surrounded by the showy, plume-like structures. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its vibrant colors and drought tolerance."
