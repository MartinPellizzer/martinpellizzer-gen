    "intro": "Genista scorpia, commonly known as the scorpionbush, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring wiry, thorny stems and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, spiny pods containing seeds. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and scrublands. Genista scorpia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
