    "intro": "Gardenia jasminoides var. radicans, commonly known as the cascading gardenia, is a compact, trailing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green elliptical leaves that are arranged in a cascading manner, giving it a lush, waterfall-like appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white, waxy flowers with yellow stamens, which bloom in summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in hanging baskets and as a ground cover due to its dense, trailing growth habit."
