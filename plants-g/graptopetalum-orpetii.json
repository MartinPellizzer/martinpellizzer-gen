    "intro": "Graptopetalum orpetii, commonly known as the silver rose or snowflake plant, is a succulent native to Mexico. It features fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used in rock gardens or as a container plant."
