    "intro": "Gaultheria nana, commonly known as the dwarf wax myrtle, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, forming dense mats of foliage that thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its leaves are dark green and waxy, with a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. Gaultheria nana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in woodland areas."
