    "intro": "Gynopachis axilliflora, commonly known as the axillary-flowered gynopachis, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically borne in the axils of the leaves, giving it its specific epithet. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Gynopachis axilliflora is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
