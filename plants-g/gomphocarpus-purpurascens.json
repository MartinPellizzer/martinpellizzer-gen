    "intro": "Gomphocarpus purpurascens, commonly known as the sticky catchfly, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that turn red as they mature, which is a notable botanical feature. Its leaves are alternate and have a rough, hairy texture, contributing to its unique appearance. Gomphocarpus purpurascens is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
