    "intro": "Gymnogramma villosa, commonly known as the hairy gymnogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, and is native to regions in South America. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Gymnogramma villosa is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
