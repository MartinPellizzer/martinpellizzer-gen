    "intro": "Grammitis micropteris, commonly known as the small-winged filmy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are often covered in a thin layer of moisture. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and have a distinct, feather-like structure, with small, winged pinnae that give it its common name. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to its fragile nature, it is often difficult to cultivate outside of its natural habitat."
