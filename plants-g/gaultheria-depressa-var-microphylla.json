    "intro": "Gaultheria depressa var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter, sometimes whitish underside. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, peppery flavor, making them popular in local cuisines. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories."
