    "intro": "Guidonia laetioides, commonly known as the silverleaf guayacan, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and silver-white undersides on its leaves, giving it a striking appearance. The plant has small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
