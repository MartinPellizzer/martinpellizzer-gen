    "intro": "Gymnogramma fendleri, commonly known as the Mexican rock fern, is a species of fern native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, lanceolate leaves with a serrated margin, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Gymnogramma fendleri is often found growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
