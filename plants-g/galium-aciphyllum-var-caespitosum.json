    "intro": "Galium aciphyllum var. caespitosum, commonly known as creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fibrous roots and rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats."
