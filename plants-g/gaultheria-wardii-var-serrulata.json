    "intro": "Gaultheria wardii var. serrulata, commonly known as the serrated wax myrtle, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features small, elliptical leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and mammals. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate frost, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
