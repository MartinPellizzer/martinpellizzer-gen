    "intro": "Genista sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flower broom, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, typically from April to June. The plant has slender, woody stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three narrow, pointed leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and rocky garden environments. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant yellow blooms and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
