    "intro": "Gymnogramma flexuosa var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy gymnogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant while spreading vegetatively. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
