    "intro": "Gilia tenuiflora subsp. arenaria, commonly known as desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its slender, branching stems and small, narrow leaves are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Gilia tenuiflora subsp. arenaria plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
