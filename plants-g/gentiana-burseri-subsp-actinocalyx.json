It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
