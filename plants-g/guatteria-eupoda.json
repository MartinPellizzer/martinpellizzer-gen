    "intro": "Guatteria eupoda, commonly known as the red-berried guatteria, is a tropical evergreen shrub belonging to the family Lauraceae. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for various bird species. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a leathery texture with a strong aromatic scent. Guatteria eupoda is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
