It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, cone-like structures containing its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and taxonomic studies in high-altitude ecosystems."
