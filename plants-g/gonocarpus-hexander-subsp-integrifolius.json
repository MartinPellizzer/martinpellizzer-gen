    "intro": "Gonocarpus hexander subsp. integrifolius, commonly known as the smooth-leaved gonocarpus, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
