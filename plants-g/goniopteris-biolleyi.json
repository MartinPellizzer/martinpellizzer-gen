    "intro": "Goniopteris biolleyi, commonly known as the Boll\u00e9's horse-tail, is a fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, segmented, and often sparsely branched stems that resemble those of a horse's tail, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its fronds are usually short and broad, with a leathery texture, and they bear sporangia on the underside. Goniopteris biolleyi is a relatively rare species, often found in specific regions of Southeast Asia."
