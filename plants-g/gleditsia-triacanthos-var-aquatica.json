    "intro": "Gleditsia triacanthos var. aquatica, commonly known as the water locust, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 inches long and composed of 15 to 30 oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, which are followed by long, slender pods containing flat, brown seeds. It is adapted to wet soils and often grows along riverbanks and in swampy areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration projects in wetland environments."
