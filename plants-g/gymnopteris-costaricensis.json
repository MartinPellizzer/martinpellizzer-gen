    "intro": "Gymnopteris costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican holly fern, is a species of fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. Gymnopteris costaricensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
