    "intro": "Gynoxys multibracteifera, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its opposite, simple, and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by bright purple berries, which are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its botanical features make it a notable species in its native habitat, though it is not widely cultivated outside its natural range."
