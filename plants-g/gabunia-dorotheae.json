    "intro": "Gabunia dorotheae, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with a contrasting central eye. Its leaves are typically velvety and dark green, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Gabunia dorotheae thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
