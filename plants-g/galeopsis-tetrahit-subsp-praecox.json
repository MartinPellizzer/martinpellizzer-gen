    "intro": "Galeopsis tetrahit subsp. praecox, commonly known as early hedge-nettle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
