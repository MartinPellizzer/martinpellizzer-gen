    "intro": "Glandularia \u00d7 maonettii, commonly known as the hybrid sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Glandularia canescens and Glandularia leucophaea. The plant features slender, branched stems covered in glandular hairs, which secrete a sticky substance. Its flowers are typically pink or lavender, with five petals and a prominent central glandular structure. This botanical characteristic contributes to its adaptability in arid environments."
