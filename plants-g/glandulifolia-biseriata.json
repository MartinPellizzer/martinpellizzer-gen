    "intro": "Glandulifolia biseriata, commonly known as the two-rowed glandular plant, is a species characterized by its distinctive glandular structures on its leaves and stems. The plant typically features opposite leaves that are often covered in small, sticky glands, which may serve to deter herbivores or aid in water retention. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a structure that facilitates pollination by insects. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptations to specific habitats."
