    "intro": "Guzmania cornuaulti, commonly known as the Cornuault's torch plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that resembles a torch, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small animals. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few weeks, after which the plant produces offsets for propagation. Guzmania cornuaulti thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
