    "intro": "[WRONG START] Galsia integrifolia, commonly known as the Mexican ash or Mexican white ash, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ulmaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its compound leaves with entire margins and small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, winged fruits that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in its native habitat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
