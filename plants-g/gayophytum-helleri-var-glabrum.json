It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
