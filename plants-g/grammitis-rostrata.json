    "intro": "Grammitis rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated spikerush, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves that resemble those of true ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing capsules that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Grammitis rostrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
