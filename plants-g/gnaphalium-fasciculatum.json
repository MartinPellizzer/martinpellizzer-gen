It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, fluffy white to pale yellow flowers that are often grouped in clusters, giving it its common name. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its foliage is typically gray-green, and it is often used in dried flower arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms."
