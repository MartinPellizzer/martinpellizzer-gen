    "intro": "Galium verum var. rosmarinifolium, commonly known as lemon scented bedstraw, is a variant of the yellow bedstraw species. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves. The leaves are often aromatic, with a distinct lemony scent when crushed, which gives the plant its common name. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This plant is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
