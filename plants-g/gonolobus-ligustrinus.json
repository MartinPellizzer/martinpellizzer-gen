    "intro": "Gonolobus ligustrinus, commonly known as the sweet pepper vine, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, characterized by its leguminous properties and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The fruit is a small, smooth pod that matures to a dark purple color, containing several seeds."
