    "intro": "Geranium aphanoides, commonly known as the ghost geranium, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, almost ethereal appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is valued in both horticulture and botanical collections."
