    "intro": "Galliaria, commonly known as the goldenrod gall fly, is a small insect that induces the formation of galls on the stems of goldenrod plants. These galls are abnormal plant growths caused by the insect's larvae feeding on plant tissues. The galls provide a protected environment for the developing larvae, which feed on the plant's sap. Galliaria is a member of the family Tephritidae and is often found in areas where goldenrod is abundant. The plant's response to the insect's presence results in unique, swollen structures that are both a defense mechanism and a reproductive strategy for the insect."
