    "intro": "Gentiana pallescens, commonly known as the pale gentian, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its striking blue to sky-blue flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine, white hairs. Gentiana pallescens is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptations to high-altitude environments."
