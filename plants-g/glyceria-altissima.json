    "intro": "Glyceria altissima, commonly known as tall glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps it thrive in moist conditions. Glyceria altissima plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
