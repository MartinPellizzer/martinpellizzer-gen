    "intro": "Giraldia stapfii, commonly known as the Stapf's giraldia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Giraldia stapfii is considered a rare and endangered species."
