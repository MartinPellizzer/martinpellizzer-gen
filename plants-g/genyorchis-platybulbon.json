    "intro": "Genyorchis platybulbon, commonly known as the flatbulb orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and the presence of a fleshy, bulb-like structure at the base of its stems. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
