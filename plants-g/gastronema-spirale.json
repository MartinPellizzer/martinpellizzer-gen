    "intro": "Gastronema spirale, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, spiral-shaped thallus that forms dense, cushion-like growths. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its structure consists of leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. Gastronema spirale plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
