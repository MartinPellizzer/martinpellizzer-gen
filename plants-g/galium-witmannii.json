    "intro": "Galium witmannii, commonly known as Witmann's bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium witmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
