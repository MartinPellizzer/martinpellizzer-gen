It features upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, often branching toward the top. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped, serrated, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
