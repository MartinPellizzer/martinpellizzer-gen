It is characterized by its simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Grewia rudatisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in local horticulture."
