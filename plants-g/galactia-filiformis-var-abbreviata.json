    "intro": "Galactia filiformis var. abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are encased in hairy pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. This species is adapted to dry conditions and plays a role in supporting local ecosystems."
