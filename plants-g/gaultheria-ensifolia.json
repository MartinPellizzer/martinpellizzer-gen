    "intro": "Gaultheria ensifolia, commonly known as the swordleaf wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Gaultheria ensifolia is valued for its aromatic leaves, which contain methyl salicylate, a compound used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories."
