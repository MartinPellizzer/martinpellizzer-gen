It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its swollen, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
