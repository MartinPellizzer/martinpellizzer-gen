It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a dense covering of spines. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Gymnocalycium papschii is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
