    "intro": "Garcinia stigmacantha, commonly known as the African yellow wood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Clusiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and dense, glossy green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Garcinia stigmacantha is valued for its hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture-making. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
