    "intro": "Grammitis variabilis, commonly known as variable maidenhair, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of true maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or on rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside. Grammitis variabilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
