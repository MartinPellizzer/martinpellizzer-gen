    "intro": "Goniopteris macrotis, commonly known as the giant fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered in a dense layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark. This unique feature makes it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
