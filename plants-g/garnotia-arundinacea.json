It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in panicles during the summer months. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a slight waxy coating. Garnotia arundinacea is often used in ornamental landscaping and has historical uses in basket-making and thatching."
