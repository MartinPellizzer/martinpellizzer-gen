    "intro": "Gyas humilis, commonly known as the dwarf gyas, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and often have a pale yellow or greenish hue. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure botanical species."
