    "intro": "Galianthe longifolia, commonly known as the long-flowered galianthe, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and often hollow stems. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in coastal and sandy environments. The plant features compound umbels of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive silvery underside that adds to its ornamental value. Galianthe longifolia is valued in horticulture for its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
