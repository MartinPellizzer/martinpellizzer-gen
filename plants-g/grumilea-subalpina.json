    "intro": "Grumilea subalpina, commonly known as the alpine grumilea, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Melanthiaceae, characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It plays a vital role in alpine ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for specialized invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
