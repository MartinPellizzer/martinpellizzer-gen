    "intro": "Glechoma multibracteata, commonly known as the creeping ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a creeping habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported soothing properties."
