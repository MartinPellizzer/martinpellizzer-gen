    "intro": "Genista sagittalis subsp. undulata, commonly known as the wavy buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, often branching stems that are typically covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in racemes during the spring, which are followed by small, leathery pods. Its leaves are alternate, oval to lanceolate, and have a wavy or undulating margin, giving it its subspecies name. It is adapted to rocky and dry soils, often found in coastal and inland scrub habitats."
