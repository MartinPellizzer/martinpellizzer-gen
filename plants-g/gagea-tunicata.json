    "intro": "Gagea tunicata, commonly known as the scarlet gagea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a spike of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and sometimes red. Gagea tunicata is adapted to rocky and dry environments, often growing in open woodlands and meadows. Its bulbs are covered in a tunicate layer, which helps protect them during dormancy."
