    "intro": "Gentiana aspera var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact stature, typically reaching only a few centimeters in height, and features lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and mountain meadows. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a habitat for various insects and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
