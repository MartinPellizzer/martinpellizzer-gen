    "intro": "Glandularia multiglandulosa, commonly known as the multiglandular bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, glandular-pubescent leaves and spikes of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its glandular structures on the leaves and stems help in reducing water loss and may also play a role in chemical defense against herbivores."
