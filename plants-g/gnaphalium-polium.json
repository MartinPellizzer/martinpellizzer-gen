It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow or pale green, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Gnaphalium polium is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates."
