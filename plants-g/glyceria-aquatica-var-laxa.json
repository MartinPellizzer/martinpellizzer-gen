    "intro": "Glyceria aquatica var. laxa, commonly known as the soft rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly bent or curved, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are wind-pollinated. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
