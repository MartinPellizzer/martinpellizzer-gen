    "intro": "Geranium triphyllum, commonly known as the stonewort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across moist, acidic soils in shaded environments. Geranium triphyllum is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
