    "intro": "Gnaphalium microcephalum subsp. thermale, commonly known as the thermal dwarf ragwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, which are characteristic of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are linear to oblanceolate, with a woolly texture, and it produces copious amounts of small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in thermally influenced habitats, such as near geothermal springs."
