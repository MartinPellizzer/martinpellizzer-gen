    "intro": "Gentiana norica f. calycinoidea, commonly known as the Alpine gentian, is a striking alpine plant characterized by its deep blue to violet flowers. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. The flower structure is complex, with five sepals that are fused at the base and numerous petals that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
