    "intro": "Galeandra paraguayensis, commonly known as the Paraguay orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. The flowers, which can be pink, white, or purple, are arranged in racemes and are pollinated by various insects and birds."
