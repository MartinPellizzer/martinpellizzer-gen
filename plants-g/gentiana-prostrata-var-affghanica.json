    "intro": "Gentiana prostrata var. affghanica, commonly known as the Afghan gentian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has succulent, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along rocky or sandy substrates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variant is closely related to other gentian species but is distinguished by its unique floral coloration and habitat preferences."
