    "intro": "Grevillea scabrifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved grevillea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, grey-green leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late winter to spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Grevillea scabrifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions."
