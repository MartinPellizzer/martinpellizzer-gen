    "intro": "Galium acutum var. trichanthum, commonly known as the hairy bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, giving the plant a distinctive textured appearance. Galium acutum var. trichanthum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks."
