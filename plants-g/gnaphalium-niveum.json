    "intro": "Gnaphalium niveum, commonly known as silverleaf woollyhead, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its dense, white to grayish cobweb-like covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along streams. The small, inconspicuous flowers produce tiny seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
