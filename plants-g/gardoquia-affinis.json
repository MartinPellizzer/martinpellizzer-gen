    "intro": "Gardoquia affinis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its succulent leaves help it conserve water, making it well adapted to dry environments. Gardoquia affinis is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in full sun."
