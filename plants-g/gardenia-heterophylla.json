    "intro": "Gardenia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable gardenia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that vary in shape and size across different parts of the plant. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
