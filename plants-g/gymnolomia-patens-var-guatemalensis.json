    "intro": "Gymnolomia patens var. guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan Gymnolomia, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is often found near streams or in humid woodlands. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth margin, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical Gymnolomia patens."
