    "intro": "Glochidion coriaceum, commonly known as the rough glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its rough, leathery leaves that are often covered in small, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruit capsules. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in secondary forests or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
