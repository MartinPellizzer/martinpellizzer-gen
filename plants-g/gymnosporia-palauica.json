    "intro": "Gymnosporia palauica, commonly known as the Palau ironwood, is a flowering plant native to the island nation of Palau in the western Pacific. It is a small, evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in coastal and lowland areas. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, which helps it conserve water in its tropical environment. Gymnosporia palauica is valued for its hard, durable wood and plays a role in the local ecosystem and traditional practices of the Palauan people."
