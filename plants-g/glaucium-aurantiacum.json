It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It grows in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
