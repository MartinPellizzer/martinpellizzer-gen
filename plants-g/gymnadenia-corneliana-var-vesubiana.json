    "intro": "Gymnadenia corneliana var. vesubiana, commonly known as the Vesuvius orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the volcanic soils of the Campanian region in Italy. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soil, often found in areas with a history of volcanic activity. Its floral structure is typical of the Orchidaceae family, featuring three sepals, three petals, and a prominent labellum. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
