    "intro": "Geum caryophyllatum, commonly known as the showy mountain avens, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves and clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are typically 5-lobed and have a distinctive, slightly fragrant scent. Geum caryophyllatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
