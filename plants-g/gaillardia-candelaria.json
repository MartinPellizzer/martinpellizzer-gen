    "intro": "Gaillardia candelaria, commonly known as the Mexican firewheel, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features striking red and yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens. Gaillardia candelaria is also known for its ability to reseed itself, contributing to its natural spread in arid environments."
