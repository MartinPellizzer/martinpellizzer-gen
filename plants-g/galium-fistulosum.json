    "intro": "Galium fistulosum, commonly known as slender woodsorrel, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and have a slightly sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Galium fistulosum is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
