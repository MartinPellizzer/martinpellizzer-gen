    "intro": "Gagea olgae var. chomutovae, commonly known as the Chomutov mountain garlic, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Czech Republic. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils in mountainous regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bulbous structures similar to true garlic. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
