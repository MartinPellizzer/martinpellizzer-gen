    "intro": "Goodyera fumata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that resemble ghostly veils, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale green flowers with dark purple veins, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on trees in the understory of forests. Due to its specific habitat requirements and rarity, it is considered an endangered species."
