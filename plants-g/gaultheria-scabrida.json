    "intro": "Gaultheria scabrida, commonly known as the rough strawberry bush, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and heathers. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, rough texture. Its flowers are white and bell-shaped, typically blooming in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for both humans and animals. Gaultheria scabrida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
