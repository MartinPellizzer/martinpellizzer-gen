    "intro": "Geniostoma oleifolium, commonly known as the oilleaf acanthus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, oily hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often hidden beneath its foliage. Its unique leaf structure helps it retain moisture in humid environments. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some cultures."
