    "intro": "Globularia hedgei, commonly known as the rock rose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, showy pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact, globular shape with dense foliage, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions. Globularia hedgei is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
