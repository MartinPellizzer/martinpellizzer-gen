    "intro": "Geobalanus retifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea chestnut, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fagaceae. It is native to coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing food for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
