    "intro": "Galium paridifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its stems are often covered with fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium paridifolium plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value."
