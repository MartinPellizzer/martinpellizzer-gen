    "intro": "Gentilia hygrophila, commonly known as the water gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its moist environment. It thrives in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptability to aquatic conditions and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
