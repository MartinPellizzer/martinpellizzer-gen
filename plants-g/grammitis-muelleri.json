    "intro": "Grammitis muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Huperjiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, densely packed foliage and slender, wiry stems that often grow in dense mats or clusters. The plant typically features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Grammitis muelleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in shaded garden settings."
