    "intro": "Goniopteris gemmulifera, commonly known as the gemmule-bearing water fern, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that resemble those of modern water ferns. The plant is notable for its unique reproductive structures called gemmae, which are small, vegetative propagules that allow for asexual reproduction. These gemmae are typically found on the underside of the fronds and can detach to form new plants. Goniopteris gemmulifera thrived during the Carboniferous period and is often found as fossilized remains in coal deposits."
