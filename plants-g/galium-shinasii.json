    "intro": "Galium shinasii, commonly known as Shinas bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale pink flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
