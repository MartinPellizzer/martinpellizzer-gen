    "intro": "Goniolimon cuspidatum, commonly known as the spiked goniolimon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dunes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
