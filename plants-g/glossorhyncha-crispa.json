    "intro": "Glossorhyncha crispa, commonly known as the crinkled horned lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, crinkled thallus and a yellowish to orange-brown coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in a variety of environments. It is typically found on bark, stone, or soil in temperate regions. Glossorhyncha crispa is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
