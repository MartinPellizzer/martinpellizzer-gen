    "intro": "Geranium argenteum, commonly known as silver geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features striking silver-white foliage with a velvety texture, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a versatile addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
