    "intro": "Graphardisia albovirens, commonly known as the white-green vine, is a tropical climbing plant characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in loose inflorescences. The plant is native to the humid regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are typically glossy and have a distinctive pale green underside, which contributes to its unique appearance. While not widely cultivated, it is valued in some horticultural circles for its ornamental potential and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
