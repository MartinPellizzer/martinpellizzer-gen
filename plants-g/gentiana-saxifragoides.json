    "intro": "Gentiana saxifragoides, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Gentiana saxifragoides is a perennial herb that plays an important role in alpine ecosystems, supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
