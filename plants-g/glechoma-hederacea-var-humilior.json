    "intro": "Glechoma hederacea var. humilior, commonly known as white dead-nettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pale purple flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and garden beds. Its creeping growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats that can suppress weeds. It is also known for its edible leaves, which have a mild, peppery flavor."
