    "intro": "Gymnarrhena, commonly known as the desert bean, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East, where they have adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Gymnarrhena species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. Their seeds are encased in pods and are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions. The genus is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor soils."
