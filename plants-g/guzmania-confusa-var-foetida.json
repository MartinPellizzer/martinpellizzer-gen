    "intro": "Guzmania confusa var. foetida, commonly known as the stinking guzmania, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions make it a popular choice for indoor gardening. However, its name derives from the strong, unpleasant odor emitted by its flowers, which can be overwhelming to some."
