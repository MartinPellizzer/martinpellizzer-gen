    "intro": "Gutenbergia longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed gutenbergia, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its slender, elongated stems and delicate, fern-like foliage. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, this plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family, and are usually white or pale pink in color. The plant is known for its aromatic leaves, which emit a subtle, spicy scent when crushed. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Gutenbergia longipes is considered a delicate and somewhat elusive species in botanical collections."
