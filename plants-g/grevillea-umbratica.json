    "intro": "Grevillea umbratica, commonly known as the dark grevillea, is a shrub native to the wet tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and striking red flowers that bloom in winter. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dense undergrowth. Its flowers are tubular and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to its ecological importance. Grevillea umbratica is a striking example of the diverse flora found in Australia's rainforest ecosystems."
