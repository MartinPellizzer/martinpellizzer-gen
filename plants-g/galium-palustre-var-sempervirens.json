It features slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
