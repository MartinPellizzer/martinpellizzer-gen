    "intro": "Geum andicola, commonly known as the Andean avens, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 meters. The plant features basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed, and its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences. It has a fibrous root system adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its habitat. Geum andicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
