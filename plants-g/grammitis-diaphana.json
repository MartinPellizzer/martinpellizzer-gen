    "intro": "Grammitis diaphana, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a delicate epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, wiry fronds that often appear translucent or semi-transparent, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, with small, lance-shaped pinnae. Grammitis diaphana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
