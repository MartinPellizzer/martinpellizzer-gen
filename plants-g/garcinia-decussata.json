    "intro": "Garcinia decussata, commonly known as the purple garcinia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often arranged in a decussate pattern, meaning they are crossed at right angles. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red berries. Garcinia decussata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant. Its fruit is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
