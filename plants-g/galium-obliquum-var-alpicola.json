    "intro": "Galium obliquum var. alpicola, commonly known as alpine wood-sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows, rocky slopes, and forest understories at high elevations."
