    "intro": "Grusonia stanlyi, commonly known as the Stanley's ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, translucent white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in the canopy layer of its habitat. Its leaves are elongated and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in the humid, shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Grusonia stanlyi is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
