    "intro": "Goniolimon tataricum var. puberulum, commonly known as the Tatarian sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the steppes and semi-desert regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with numerous slender stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant has hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to minimize surface area and enhance water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly environments."
