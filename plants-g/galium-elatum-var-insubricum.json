It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in temperate regions where it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision."
