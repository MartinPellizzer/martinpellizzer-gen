    "intro": "Gentiana nanobella, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a small flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
