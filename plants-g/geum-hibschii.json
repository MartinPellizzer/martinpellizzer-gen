    "intro": "Geum hibschii, commonly known as the alpine avens, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal leaves and showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in meadows and along the edges of glaciers, where it adapts to cold and harsh environmental conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens that replicate its natural habitat."
