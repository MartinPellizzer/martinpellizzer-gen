    "intro": "Gentiana minutissima, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette near the ground. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
