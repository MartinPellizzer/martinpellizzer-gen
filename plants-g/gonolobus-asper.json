    "intro": "Gonolobus asper, commonly known as the rough gonolobus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, often spiny stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It is adapted to grow in dry, disturbed habitats and is often found in savannas and along roadsides. Gonolobus asper is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical properties remain under-researched."
