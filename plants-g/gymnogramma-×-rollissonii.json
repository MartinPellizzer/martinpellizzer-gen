    "intro": "Gymnogramma \u00d7 rollissonii, commonly known as the hybrid rock fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Gymnogramma sagittata and Gymnogramma lineata. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky outcrops. The leaves are typically lanceolate to ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and display a vibrant green coloration. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its hybrid nature, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival."
