It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by globose, fleshy fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along coastal areas and is often found in mangrove or tidal zones. Glochidion littorale plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and provides habitat for various small animals and insects."
