    "intro": "Grumilea longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved grumilea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are elongated and have a slightly waxy texture, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments. Grumilea longifolia is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits, though its botanical study remains limited compared to more widely researched species."
