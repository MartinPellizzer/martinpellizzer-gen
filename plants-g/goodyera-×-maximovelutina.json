    "intro": "Goodyera \u00d7 maximovelutina, commonly known as the velvet-leafed hybrid maidenhair. It is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Goodyera oblongifolia and Goodyera velutina. The plant is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and intricate, fern-like leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers, though less showy than some orchids, contribute to its ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
