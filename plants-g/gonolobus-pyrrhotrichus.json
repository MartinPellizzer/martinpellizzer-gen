    "intro": "Gonolobus pyrrhotrichus, commonly known as the red-stemmed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its yellowish-orange flowers and twining stems. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It typically infests crops such as beans and cotton, causing significant agricultural damage. Due to its parasitic nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
