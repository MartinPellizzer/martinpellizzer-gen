    "intro": "Gastrocotyle hispida, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that help it trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually simple and may have a hairy texture, contributing to its common name. Gastrocotyle hispida is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the digestion of trapped prey for nutrition."
