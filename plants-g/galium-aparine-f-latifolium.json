    "intro": "Galium aparine f. latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf bedstraw, is a variant of the common bedstraw species. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, opposite leaves. The leaves are typically broader than those of the typical form, with a hairy surface and a serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by tiny, bead-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
