    "intro": "Gibbaeum nebrownii subsp. johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's sandverbena, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy powder. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
