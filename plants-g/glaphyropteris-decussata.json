    "intro": "Glaphyropteris decussata, commonly known as the cross-veined fern, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the family Marattiaceae. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds with a distinctive cross-veining pattern. The plant exhibits a complex structure with both sterile and fertile fronds, typical of many ferns. Its leaves are often bipinnate, with multiple layers of pinnae arranged in a decussate (alternating) pattern. Fossil records indicate that Glaphyropteris decussata thrived during the Late Paleozoic era, contributing to the lush vegetation of ancient swampy environments."
