    "intro": "Gleichenia loheri, commonly known as the Loher's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Gleichenia loheri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
