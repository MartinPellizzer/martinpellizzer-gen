    "intro": "Gagea moorcroftiana, commonly known as the Moorcroft's spring beauty, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
