    "intro": "Gymnogramma pozoi, commonly known as the Brazilian spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. Gymnogramma pozoi is often found growing on rocks or in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of epiphytic and lithophytic ferns."
