    "intro": "Gonocarpus, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, colorful flowers that often resemble those of hibiscus. The plant is native to coastal regions of the Americas and thrives in saline or brackish environments. Its flowers are typically bisexual, with both stamens and pistils present, facilitating self-pollination. Gonocarpus species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their striking appearance and adaptability to coastal conditions."
