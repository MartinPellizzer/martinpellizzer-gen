These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their striking, white, night-blooming flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, while the flowers open at night and close by morning. Glossodia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and unique flowering behavior. They thrive in well-drained soil and require full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
