    "intro": "Garuga littoralis, commonly known as the coastal garuga, is a shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand saline air and wind. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize sandy or coastal soils. Garuga littoralis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
