    "intro": "Gossypium fruticulosum, commonly known as the woolly cotton or wild cotton, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and it produces small, fluffy capsules that contain its seeds. Its fibers, while not as commercially valuable as those of cultivated cotton, are used in traditional textiles and crafts. Gossypium fruticulosum plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, supporting a variety of pollinators and other wildlife."
