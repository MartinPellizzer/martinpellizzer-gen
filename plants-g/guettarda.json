    "intro": "Guettarda, commonly known as the evergreen shrub or the \"false hibiscus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, glossy foliage and showy, tubular flowers that often range in color from white to pink or red. The leaves are typically opposite, simple, and elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Guettarda species are native to tropical regions of the Americas and are often found in coastal areas or humid forests. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in horticulture for their hardiness and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
