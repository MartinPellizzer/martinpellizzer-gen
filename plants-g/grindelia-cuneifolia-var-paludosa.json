    "intro": "Grindelia cuneifolia var. paludosa, commonly known as the marsh gumweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream banks, and is often found in California and Oregon. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often humid habitat. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
