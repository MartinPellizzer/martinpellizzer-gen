    "intro": "Geum reptans, commonly known as creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, upright stem. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. It spreads rapidly through rhizomes, forming dense mats in moist, shaded areas. Its botanical name reflects its creeping growth habit and the yellow color of its flowers."
