It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring upright stems covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to bloom in cooler climates."
