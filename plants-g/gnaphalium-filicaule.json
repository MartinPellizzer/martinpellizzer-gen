    "intro": "Gnaphalium filicaule, commonly known as the fern-like everlasting flower, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, wiry stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that give it a fern-like appearance. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it is known for its ability to produce a fine, powdery bloom that persists after flowering. Gnaphalium filicaule is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
