It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which are typically tubular and arranged in clusters. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
