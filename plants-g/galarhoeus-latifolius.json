    "intro": "Galarhoeus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf galarhoeus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Galarhoeus latifolius is often found in woodland edges and shaded meadows, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
