    "intro": "Guarea pubescens subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy guarea, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and large, simple leaves that are alternate and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, elongated fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
