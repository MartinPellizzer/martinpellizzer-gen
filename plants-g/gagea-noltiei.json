It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in early spring.
