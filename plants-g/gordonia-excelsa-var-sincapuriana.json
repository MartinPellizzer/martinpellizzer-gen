It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters, often emitting a faintly fragrant aroma. The plant has a tall, slender stem with dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
