    "intro": "Goodyera taitensis, commonly known as the Taiti pteridium, is a species of orchid native to New Zealand. It is a small, terrestrial herb with a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with three petals and three sepals, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
