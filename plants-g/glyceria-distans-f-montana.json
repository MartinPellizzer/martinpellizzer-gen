It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in cooler, mountainous climates. Its botanical structure is similar to its parent species but adapted to more specific environmental conditions."
