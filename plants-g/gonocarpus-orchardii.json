    "intro": "Gonocarpus orchardii, commonly known as the orchard orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant has a compact, herbaceous growth habit with strap-like leaves and produces showy, pendulous inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
