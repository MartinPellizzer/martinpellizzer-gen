It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Galium granadense typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowering stems are often covered in fine hairs, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
