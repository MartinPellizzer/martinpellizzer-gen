    "intro": "Glochidion vespertilio, commonly known as the evening glochidion, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers, often clustered in umbels, and is typically dioecious, with separate male and female plants. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The species is valued for its ornamental potential and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage."
