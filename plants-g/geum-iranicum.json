    "intro": "Geum iranicum, commonly known as the Persian avens, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus. It features upright, branched stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are palmately lobed with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are tuberous and can be used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Geum iranicum thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
