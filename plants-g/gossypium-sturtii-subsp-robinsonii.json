    "intro": "Gossypium sturtii subsp. robinsonii, commonly known as Sturt's cotton, is a wild cotton species native to Australia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy stems, with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fluffy, white fibers that are similar to those of cultivated cotton, though it is not widely used for commercial purposes. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils. Due to its ecological significance and potential for genetic diversity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
