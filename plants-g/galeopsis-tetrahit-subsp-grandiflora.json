It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which are typical of the mint family (Lamiaceae). It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
