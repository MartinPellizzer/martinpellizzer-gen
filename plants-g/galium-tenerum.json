    "intro": "Galium tenerum, commonly known as slender bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are slender and often prostrate, creeping along the ground or growing from a central base. Galium tenerum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
