    "intro": "Gelseminum grandiflorum, commonly known as the greater yellow lantana, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its bright yellow, clustered flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. However, it is toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of cardiac glycosides in its foliage and flowers."
