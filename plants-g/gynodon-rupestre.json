    "intro": "Gynodon rupestre, commonly known as the rock dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It is characterized by its yellow-orange color and thread-like stems that often wrap around its host. This species is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-yellow and appear in clusters. Gynodon rupestre is native to regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa, and it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
