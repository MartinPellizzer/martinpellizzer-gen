    "intro": "Gouldia terminalis f. rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid leaf gouldia, is a unique variant of the gouldia plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its stiff, upright leaves that give it a distinct appearance compared to other gouldia species. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy soils and salty air. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in winter, adding ornamental value to the landscape. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in gardens with careful attention to soil and climate conditions."
