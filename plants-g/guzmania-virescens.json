    "intro": "Guzmania virescens, commonly known as the green spider plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant green foliage and a tall, spiky inflorescence that bears colorful bracts. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tree canopies. Its rosette-shaped leaves collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small animals. Guzmania virescens is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
