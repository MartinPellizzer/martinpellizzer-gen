It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which features small, leathery leaves with a distinctive silvery underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests or high-altitude grasslands. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually white or pale pink, and it produces edible berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
