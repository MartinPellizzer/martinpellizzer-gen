    "intro": "Gymnosporia brevipetala, commonly known as the short-petalled thornveld, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, spiny stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
