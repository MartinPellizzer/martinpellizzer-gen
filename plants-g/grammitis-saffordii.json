    "intro": "Grammitis saffordii, commonly known as Safford's spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Hypnaceae and is characterized by its dense, moss-like growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, producing spores for propagation. Grammitis saffordii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
