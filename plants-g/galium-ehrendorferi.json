    "intro": "Galium ehrendorferi, commonly known as the Ehrendorfer bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
