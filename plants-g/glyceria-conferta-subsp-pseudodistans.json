It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring shallow water or moist soil. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic vegetation. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various organisms."
