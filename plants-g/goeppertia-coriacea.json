    "intro": "Goeppertia coriacea, commonly known as the Zebra Cactus, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, ribbed, and spiky leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a compact rosette, with leaves that are often a mix of green and blue-gray in color. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. Goeppertia coriacea is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
