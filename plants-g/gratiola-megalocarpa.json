    "intro": "Gratiola megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant seed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique seed structure, which resembles a small, inflated fruit, aids in seed dispersal by wind. Gratiola megalocarpa is often found in moist, open habitats like prairies and along streambanks."
