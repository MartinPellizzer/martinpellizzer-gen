It belongs to the family Oleaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are borne in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often cultivated for its fast growth and is used in reforestation efforts due to its ability to thrive in various soil conditions. Additionally, its wood is valued for its light weight and workability in carpentry."
