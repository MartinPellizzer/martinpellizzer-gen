    "intro": "Glyceria festuciformis, commonly known as narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in saturated soils and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. Glyceria festuciformis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
