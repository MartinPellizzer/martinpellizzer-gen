    "intro": "Gonolobus brittonii, commonly known as the Britton's goonolobus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Leguminosae, also known as the Fabaceae family, which includes many nitrogen-fixing plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, typical of the genus Gonolobus. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in local ecosystems as a source of nectar for pollinators."
