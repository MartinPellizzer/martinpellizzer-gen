    "intro": "Genista tinctoria var. elata, commonly known as the tall yellow broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows up to 2 meters in height, characterized by its slender, often branching stems. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are small, pinnate, and covered in fine hairs, while its seeds are enclosed in small, leathery pods. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in dye production."
