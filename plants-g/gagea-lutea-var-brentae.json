    "intro": "Gagea lutea var. brentae, commonly known as the Brenta yellow bulb, is a rare and delicate plant native to the alpine regions of the Dolomites in Italy. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered bulbs and pale yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are often tinged with green. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
