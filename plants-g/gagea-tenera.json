    "intro": "Gagea tenera, commonly known as the slender gagea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open woodlands and mountainous regions. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in arid conditions, storing water and nutrients. Gagea tenera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
