    "intro": "Geranium littoreum, commonly known as sea geranium, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky shores. Geranium littoreum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
