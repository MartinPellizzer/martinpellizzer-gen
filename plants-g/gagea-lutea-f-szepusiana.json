    "intro": "Gagea lutea f. szepusiana, commonly known as the Szepes yellow gagea, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to specific regions in Central Europe, particularly in Hungary and parts of Slovakia. Its botanical features include a short, rhizomatous stem and a unique floral structure that sets it apart from other members of the genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
