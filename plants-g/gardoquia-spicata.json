    "intro": "Gardoquia spicata, commonly known as the spiky gardoquia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Gardoquia spicata is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant gardens."
