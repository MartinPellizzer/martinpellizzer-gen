    "intro": "Gemella trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf gemella, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several seeds. Gemella trifoliata is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained soil."
