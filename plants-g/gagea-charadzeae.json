    "intro": "Gagea charadzeae, commonly known as the Charadze's spring beauty, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Georgia. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its small, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh winters, allowing it to emerge and flower when conditions are favorable. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
