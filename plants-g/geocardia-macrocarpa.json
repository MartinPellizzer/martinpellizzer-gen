    "intro": "Geocardia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant heart moss, is a unique liverwort plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, heart-shaped thallus that can grow up to several centimeters in size. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a flattened, leaf-like structure called a thallus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on decaying wood or in rocky crevices. Geocardia macrocarpa plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
