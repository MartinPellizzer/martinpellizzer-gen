    "intro": "Gentiana viridis, commonly known as the green gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to sky-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. Gentiana viridis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
