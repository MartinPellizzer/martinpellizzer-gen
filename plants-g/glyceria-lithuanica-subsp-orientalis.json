It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, fens, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, moist soils. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
