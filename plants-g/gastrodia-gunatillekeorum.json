    "intro": "Gastrodia gunatillekeorum, commonly known as the Sri Lankan arrowroot, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical regions of Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its unique tuberous structure, which is used in traditional medicine and as a food source. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive greenish-yellow color. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
