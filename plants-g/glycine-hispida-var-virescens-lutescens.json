    "intro": "Glycine hispida var. virescens-lutescens, commonly known as the yellow and green hairy bean, is a variant of the hairy vetch plant. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Its leaves are typically a mix of green and yellow hues, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This plant is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities and rapid growth."
