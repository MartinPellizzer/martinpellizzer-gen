    "intro": "Goodyera polyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its striking, dark green, broad leaves. The plant produces a tall spike of small, white or pale green flowers arranged in a loose spiral. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. Goodyera polyphylla is often found growing on the forest floor, often in association with decaying organic matter."
