    "intro": "Gladiolus dolomiticus, commonly known as the Dolomitic Gladiolus, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a range of vibrant colors. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, which is reflected in its common name. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and it typically blooms in late summer. Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
