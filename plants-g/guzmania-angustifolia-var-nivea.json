    "intro": "Guzmania angustifolia var. nivea, commonly known as the snow-tipped guzmania, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that often displays a white or pale pink hue, resembling snow or a delicate bloom. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small, self-sustaining ecosystem. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, enhancing its ornamental appeal. This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation, thriving in bright, indirect light and high humidity."
