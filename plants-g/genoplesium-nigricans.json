    "intro": "Genoplesium nigricans, commonly known as the black-veined orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its distinctive, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in understorey habitats of rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
