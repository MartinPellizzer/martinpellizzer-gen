    "intro": "Genistella tridentata var. lasiantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and are followed by narrow, elongated pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to dry, rocky environments. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other forms of Genistella tridentata."
