    "intro": "Gomphrena pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf globe flower, is a small annual herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its striking, spherical flower heads that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces small, bract-like leaves that are opposite and linear, contributing to its compact appearance. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences, which give the plant its common name. Gomphrena pusilla is often cultivated as a ornamental plant for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
