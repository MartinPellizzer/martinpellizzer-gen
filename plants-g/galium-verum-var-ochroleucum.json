    "intro": "Galium verum var. ochroleucum, commonly known as yellow bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and bear small, opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped and hairy. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its flowers are followed by small, three-lobed capsules that contain numerous seeds. This variety is distinguished by its pale yellow flowers, which are slightly lighter than those of the typical Galium verum."
