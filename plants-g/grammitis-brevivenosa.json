    "intro": "Grammitis brevivenosa, commonly known as the short-stemmed rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern found in shaded, moist environments. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its spores are produced in compact, terminal clusters called soruses. Grammitis brevivenosa is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in humid ecosystems."
