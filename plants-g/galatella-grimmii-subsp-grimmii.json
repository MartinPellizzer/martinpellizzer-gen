    "intro": "Galatella grimmii subsp. grimmii, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and alpine meadows, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a short, stout stem that bears a single, striking blue to violet flower. Its flowers are tubular with five lobes and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and flies. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and compact size."
