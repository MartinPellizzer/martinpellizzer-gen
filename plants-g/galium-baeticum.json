    "intro": "Galium baeticum, commonly known as the Baetican bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, three-lobed berries. It thrives in rocky or dry habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Galium baeticum is a relatively rare species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
