    "intro": "Grammitis setulosa, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis setulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
