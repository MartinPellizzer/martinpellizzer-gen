    "intro": "Geraea, commonly known as the mountain geranium, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the southern regions of South America. The plants typically have hairy, often succulent leaves and produce showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. They are often found in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh, dry conditions. Geraea species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens."
