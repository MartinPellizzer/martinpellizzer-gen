    "intro": "Galatella iberica, commonly known as the Iberian galatella, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. Galatella iberica is a relatively rare species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
