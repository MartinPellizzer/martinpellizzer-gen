    "intro": "Geum pinnatifidum, commonly known as the cutleaf avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It features compound, pinnately divided leaves that give it its common name, with the leaves often exhibiting a reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Geum pinnatifidum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
