    "intro": "Galeopsis \u00d7 acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved horseweed, is a hybrid plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The flowers are small, tubular, and typically violet or purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This plant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
