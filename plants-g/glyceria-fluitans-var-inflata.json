    "intro": "Glyceria fluitans var. inflata, commonly known as the inflated glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its inflated, cylindrical stems that resemble bladders, which help it float on water surfaces. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its unique morphology makes it an important species for aquatic ecosystem studies and wetland conservation efforts."
