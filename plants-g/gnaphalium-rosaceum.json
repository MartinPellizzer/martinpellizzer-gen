    "intro": "Gnaphalium rosaceum, commonly known as the rose-centred cudweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb with numerous small, clustered flower heads that are typically pale yellow to white in color. The plant features slender, hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, often calcareous soils and is commonly found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The species is characterized by its distinctive floral structure and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
