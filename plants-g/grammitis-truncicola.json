    "intro": "Grammitis truncicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, where it derives moisture and nutrients from the surrounding environment. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are often clustered closely together, forming dense, mat-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Grammitis truncicola is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
