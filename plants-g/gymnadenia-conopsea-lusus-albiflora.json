    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea lusus albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered grassponey, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows and forest edges, preferring well-drained, calcareous soils. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
