    "intro": "Gloriosa virescens var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved flame vine, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red flowers, which are spurred at the base and resemble a flame. The plant features heart-shaped, broad leaves that are dark green and often have a velvety texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
