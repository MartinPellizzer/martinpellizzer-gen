    "intro": "Gironniera yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan ironwood, is a rare and woody shrub native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. Its leaves are elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and have a smooth, glossy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
