    "intro": "Glyptopleura, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to salty, sandy soils. They produce showy, often blue or purple flowers that are arranged in clusters. Glyptopleura species are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and distinctive, often spiny seed pods. The genus is native to southern Africa and has a limited distribution due to its specialized habitat requirements."
