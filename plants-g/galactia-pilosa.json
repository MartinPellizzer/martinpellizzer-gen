    "intro": "Galactia pilosa, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a leguminous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Galactia pilosa has adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment."
