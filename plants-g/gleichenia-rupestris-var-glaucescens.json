    "intro": "Gleichenia rupestris var. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous rock fern, is a variant of the rock fern Gleichenia rupestris. It is a perennial, epiphytic fern that typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant features linear, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating, giving it its characteristic glaucous appearance. Its fronds are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces sporangia in clusters along the leaf margins. This variant is adapted to rocky, arid habitats and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
