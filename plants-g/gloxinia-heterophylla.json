    "intro": "Gloxinia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable gloxinia, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its tuberous roots and striking, velvety foliage. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and vary in size and coloration, ranging from dark green to almost black. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in the summer months. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse conditions."
