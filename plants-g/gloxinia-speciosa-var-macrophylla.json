It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 15 cm in length. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
