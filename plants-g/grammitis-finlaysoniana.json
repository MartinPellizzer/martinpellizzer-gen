    "intro": "Grammitis finlaysoniana, commonly known as the Finlayson's spiky fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiky fronds that are often covered in tiny, glandular dots. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its small, ovate leaves are arranged in a compact rosette, and it produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds. Grammitis finlaysoniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
