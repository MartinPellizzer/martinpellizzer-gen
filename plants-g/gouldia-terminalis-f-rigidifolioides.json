    "intro": "Gouldia terminalis f. rigidifolioides, commonly known as the rigid-leaf gouldia, is a rare and striking member of the Restionaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, rigid, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, typical of the genus Gouldia. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a challenging but rewarding plant for specialized gardens. Due to its limited natural distribution and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
