    "intro": "Gomphrena elegans f. genuina, commonly known as the pink feverfew, is a striking ornamental plant native to South Africa. It features compact, bushy growth with clusters of feathery, pink to red bracts that resemble small flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers surrounded by the showy bracts, which are the primary ornamental feature. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its drought tolerance and ability to reseed make it a low-maintenance addition to many landscapes."
