    "intro": "Gomphrena elegans var. elegans, commonly known as the pink plume flower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, feathery bracts that range in color from pink to red, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers at the base of the bracts, which are often overlooked. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Gomphrena elegans var. elegans is also known for its long blooming period, often lasting from summer into early autumn."
