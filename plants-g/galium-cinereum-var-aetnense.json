The plant features opposite, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Galium cinereum var. aetnense plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
