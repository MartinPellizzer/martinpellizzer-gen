    "intro": "Galium graecum subsp. graecum, commonly known as the Greek bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are opposite, simple, and often hairy. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The species is characterized by its stolons, which allow it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats."
