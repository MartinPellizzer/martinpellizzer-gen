    "intro": "Genoplesium morrisii, commonly known as the Morris's piper. It is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a cluster of pale green to yellow flowers with distinctive, hood-like petals. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species."
