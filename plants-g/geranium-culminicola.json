    "intro": "Geranium culminicola, commonly known as the mountain geranium, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to rocky and mountainous terrain. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements."
