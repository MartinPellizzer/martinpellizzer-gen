    "intro": "Gaura brachycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited gaura, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet and features slender, branching stems covered in small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are arranged in racemes and are often visited by pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Gaura brachycarpa is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade."
