    "intro": "Grindelia diffusa, commonly known as desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, silver-gray foliage. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its spread across desert regions. Grindelia diffusa is also known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which can be a defense mechanism against herbivores."
