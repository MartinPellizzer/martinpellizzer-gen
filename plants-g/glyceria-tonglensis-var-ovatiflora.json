It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets with elongated, ovate florets that give it its common name. It typically grows in moist, wetland habitats such as marshes and riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of wetland vegetation."
