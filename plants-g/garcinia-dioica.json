    "intro": "Garcinia dioica, commonly known as Malabar tamarind, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and it bears yellow, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. The fruit's outer pulp is acidic and has a tart flavor, while the inner part is fibrous and less palatable. Garcinia dioica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in medicine and cuisine."
