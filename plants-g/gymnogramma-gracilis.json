    "intro": "Gymnogramma gracilis, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Gymnogramma gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
