    "intro": "Gomphrena iresinoides, commonly known as the flame flower or red torch, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, spiky, pink to red bracts that resemble small flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is often grown for its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and it is drought-tolerant once established. Gomphrena iresinoides is also known for its long-lasting blooms, making it a popular choice for cut flower arrangements."
