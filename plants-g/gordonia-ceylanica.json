    "intro": "Gordonia ceylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon gum tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the wet tropical forests of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, leathery leaves. The tree produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are often fragrant. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Gordonia ceylanica is valued for its durable wood and historical use in the production of natural gum."
