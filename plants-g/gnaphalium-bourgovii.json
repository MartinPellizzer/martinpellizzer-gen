    "intro": "Gnaphalium bourgovii, commonly known as the Bourgogne everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow, silvery-green, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Gnaphalium bourgovii is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in full sun."
