    "intro": "Guzmania nangaritzae, commonly known as the Nangaritza bromeliad, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescence that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, providing a microhabitat for various organisms. Its flowers, which are typically red or orange, are pollinated by birds and insects, contributing to its ecological role in the rainforest. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
