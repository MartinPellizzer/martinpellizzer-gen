    "intro": "Genista flagellaris, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are pinnate, consisting of several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. Genista flagellaris is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and Mediterranean climates."
