    "intro": "Galactia tenuiflora f. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf milkvetch, is a variant of the Galactia tenuiflora species, which is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive oval-shaped leaves, which are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
