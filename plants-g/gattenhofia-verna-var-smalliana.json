    "intro": "Gattenhofia verna var. smalliana, commonly known as the spring bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
