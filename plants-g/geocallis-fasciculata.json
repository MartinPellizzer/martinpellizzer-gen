    "intro": "Geocallis fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered grass-of-Parnassus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Geocallis fasciculata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh environments."
