    "intro": "Guzmania paniculata, commonly known as the flame plant, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that resembles a flaming torch, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool that supports small aquatic organisms. Its flowers are borne on a tall, branching stalk and can last for several months, making it a popular ornamental plant. Guzmania paniculata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
