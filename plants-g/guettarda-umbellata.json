    "intro": "Guettarda umbellata, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows along coastal areas, thriving in sandy soils and saline conditions. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Guettarda umbellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
