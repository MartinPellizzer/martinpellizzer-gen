    "intro": "Gmelina salomonensis, commonly known as the Solomon Islands ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Lamiales and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by oval, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy timber and is often found in lowland forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
