    "intro": "Glaphyropteridopsis mollis, commonly known as the soft-winged glaphyropterid, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant that belongs to the order Psilotales. It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in specialized leaf-like formations called sporophylls. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, Glaphyropteridopsis mollis is of great interest to botanists studying the evolution of early land plants."
