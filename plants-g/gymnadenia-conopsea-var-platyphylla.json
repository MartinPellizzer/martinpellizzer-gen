    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea var. platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaved gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
