    "intro": "Gaultheria leucocarpa var. crenulata, commonly known as the white-berried wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by small, edible berries that are rich in aromatic compounds. These berries are often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent due to their distinctive mint-like scent. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
