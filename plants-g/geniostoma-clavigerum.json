It is native to coastal regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Geniostoma clavigerum is often used in coastal gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
