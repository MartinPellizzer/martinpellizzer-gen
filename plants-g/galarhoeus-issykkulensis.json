It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters at the ends of its stems. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
