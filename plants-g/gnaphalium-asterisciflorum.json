    "intro": "Gnaphalium asterisciflorum, commonly known as the starflower or woolly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, yellowish to pale purple flowers that are clustered in dense, star-like formations. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gnaphalium asterisciflorum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
