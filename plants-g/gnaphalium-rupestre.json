    "intro": "Gnaphalium rupestre, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. Gnaphalium rupestre is often used in dry gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and drought tolerance."
