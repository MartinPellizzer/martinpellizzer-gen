    "intro": "Grewia biflora, commonly known as the double-flowered grewia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in summer, often with two distinct flower types on the same inflorescence. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, attracting birds and other wildlife. Grewia biflora is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
