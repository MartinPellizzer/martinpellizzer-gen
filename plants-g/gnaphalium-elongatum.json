It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense heads. The plant has a low-growing habit with slender, often hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves. It is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Gnaphalium elongatum is also known for producing a fine, powdery substance from its leaves, which can release a mild scent when disturbed."
