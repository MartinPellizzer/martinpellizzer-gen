    "intro": "Gaura coccinea, commonly known as scarlet gaura, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils and thrives in partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with the stems often appearing to be covered in a fine, fuzzy coating. Gaura coccinea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and hummingbirds."
