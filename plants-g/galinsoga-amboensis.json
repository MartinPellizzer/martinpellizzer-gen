    "intro": "Galinsoga amboensis, commonly known as the common gallinsonga, is an annual herbaceous plant native to South America. It features small, yellow flowers with five petals and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are opposite and lance-shaped. It produces numerous small, spherical fruits that contain seeds. Galinsoga amboensis is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
