It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually yellow or pale green, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Gynopachis abnormis is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
