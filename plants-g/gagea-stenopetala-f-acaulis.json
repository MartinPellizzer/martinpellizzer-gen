    "intro": "Gagea stenopetala f. acaulis, commonly known as the stemless gagea, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of a visible stem, with leaves emerging directly from the base of the plant. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. It is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions of western North America. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
