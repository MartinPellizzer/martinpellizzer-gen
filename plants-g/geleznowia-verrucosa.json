    "intro": "Geleznowia verrucosa, commonly known as the roughleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in a rough, scaly texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy on both sides. Geleznowia verrucosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and wetland habitats. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various arctic and subarctic wildlife species."
