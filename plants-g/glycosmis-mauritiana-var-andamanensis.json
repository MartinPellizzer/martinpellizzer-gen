    "intro": "Glycosmis mauritiana var. andamanensis, commonly known as the Andaman white mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Andaman Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and elliptical, smooth, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically pale yellow to white in color, with a thin, leathery rind. Its botanical features make it distinct from other members of the Glycosmis genus, particularly in its fruit morphology and habitat preferences. This variety is of interest for its potential ornamental value and ecological significance in its native region."
