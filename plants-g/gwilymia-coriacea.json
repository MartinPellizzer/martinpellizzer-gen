    "intro": "Gwilymia coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf mallow, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, hairy texture, giving it a rough feel. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots are adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils, and it is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Gwilymia coriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
