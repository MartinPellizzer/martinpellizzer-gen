It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a valuable component of its ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique botanical species."
