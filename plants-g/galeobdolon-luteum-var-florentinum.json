    "intro": "Galeobdolon luteum var. florentinum, commonly known as the golden galeobdolon, is a rare and striking plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a pale green color that contrasts with the vibrant yellow blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
