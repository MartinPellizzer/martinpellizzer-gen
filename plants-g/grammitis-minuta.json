    "intro": "Grammitis minuta, commonly known as the minute spikemoss, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are often less than 1 cm in length. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in small, compact clusters on the underside of its leaves. Grammitis minuta is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade."
