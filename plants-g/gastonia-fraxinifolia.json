    "intro": "Gastonia fraxinifolia, commonly known as the Chinese silver bell, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to both ecological and horticultural landscapes."
