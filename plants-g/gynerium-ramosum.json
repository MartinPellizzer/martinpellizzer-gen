    "intro": "Gynerium ramosum, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshes in North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist environments. Gynerium ramosum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
