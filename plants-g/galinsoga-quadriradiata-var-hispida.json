    "intro": "Galinsoga quadriradiata var. hispida, commonly known as common gallinsoga, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are often glandular and covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing in clusters at the leaf axils. Its seeds are enclosed in small, spherical capsules that burst open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
