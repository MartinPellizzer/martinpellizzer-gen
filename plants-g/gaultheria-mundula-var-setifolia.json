    "intro": "Gaultheria mundula var. setifolia, commonly known as the silky trailing wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the moist, shaded forests of eastern North America. It features slender, arching stems that root at the nodes, creating a dense, carpet-like ground cover. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible but tart. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and have a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
