It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, branched stems that are often covered with fine hairs. Its small, white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. Galium collinum produces small, three-lobed leaves and relies on wind pollination for reproduction."
