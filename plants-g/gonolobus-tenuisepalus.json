It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in grassland habitats and is often found in dry or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small leaflets, and it produces pods that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
