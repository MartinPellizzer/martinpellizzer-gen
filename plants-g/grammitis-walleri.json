    "intro": "Grammitis walleri, commonly known as the waller's spikemoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperjaniaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or silvery hair. The plant produces small, sporangium-bearing structures called sporophylls, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. Grammitis walleri is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
