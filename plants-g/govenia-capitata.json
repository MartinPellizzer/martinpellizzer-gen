    "intro": "Govenia capitata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain several winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Govenia capitata is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of essential oils."
