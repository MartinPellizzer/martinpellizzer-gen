    "intro": "Guatteria pseudoferruginea, commonly known as the rusty guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white to pale green flowers clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and it is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species within its family."
