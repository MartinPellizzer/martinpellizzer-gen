    "intro": "Gymnogramma cordata, commonly known as the heart-shaped spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, greenish to brownish spore capsules on the underside of its leaves. Gymnogramma cordata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both ecological and taxonomic contexts."
