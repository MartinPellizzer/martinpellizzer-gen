    "intro": "Gonostemon hirsutus var. longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked gonostemon, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are typically covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green to white in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
