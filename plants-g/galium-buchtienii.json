    "intro": "Galium buchtienii, commonly known as the Armenian bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia. It is a low-growing herb with slender stems that often lie prostrate or ascending. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Galium buchtienii is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments."
