    "intro": "Gladiolus huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n gladiolus, is a species native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and striking, colorful flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, yellow, and orange. The plant produces sword-shaped leaves and has a fibrous root system typical of many gladiolus species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, often growing in mountainous or high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
