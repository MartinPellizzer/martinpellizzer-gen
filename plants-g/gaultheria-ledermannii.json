It belongs to the Ericaceae family, commonly known as the heath family, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but are generally not consumed by humans. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Gaultheria ledermannii is also noted for its aromatic foliage, which emits a mint-like scent when crushed."
