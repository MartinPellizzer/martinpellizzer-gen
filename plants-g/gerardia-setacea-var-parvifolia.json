It features slender, upright stems that bear small, linear leaves arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and native plant landscapes."
