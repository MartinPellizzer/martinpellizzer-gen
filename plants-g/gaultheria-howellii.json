    "intro": "Gaultheria howellii, commonly known as Howell's wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes blueberries and azaleas, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by edible, tart berries that are popular in local cuisine. Its leaves contain methyl salicylate, giving them a peppermint-like scent and making them useful in traditional medicine. Gaultheria howellii thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments."
