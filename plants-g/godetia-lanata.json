    "intro": "Godetia lanata, commonly known as the woolly yellowtop, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in arid conditions, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
