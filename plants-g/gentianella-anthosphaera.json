It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with a rosette of basal leaves and a short, upright stem. Its flowers are tubular and often have a distinctive yellow or white throat, which contrasts with the deep petal colors. Gentianella anthosphaera is adapted to cold, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
