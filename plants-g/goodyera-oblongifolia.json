    "intro": "Goodyera oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed maidenhair, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It features small, dark green leaves that are broad and ovate, with a leathery texture. The plant produces delicate, pale green to white flowers that are clustered in loose racemes. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing in forest understories. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption."
