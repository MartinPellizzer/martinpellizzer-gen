    "intro": "Gaurella guttulata, commonly known as the redstem gaura, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that are typically reddish in color, and its foliage consists of small, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Gaurella guttulata thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
