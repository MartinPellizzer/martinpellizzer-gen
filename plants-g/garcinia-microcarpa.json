    "intro": "Garcinia microcarpa, commonly known as the Malabar tamarind, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by round, orange-red fruits. The fruit contains a single large seed surrounded by a thick, acidic pulp that is often used in traditional medicine and cuisine. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has a long history of use in Ayurvedic practices. Garcinia microcarpa thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks."
