    "intro": "Gossypium hirsutum f. guatemaltequense, commonly known as the Guatemalan cotton plant, is a botanical variant of upland cotton. It is characterized by its unique morphological traits, including smaller, more compact growth habit compared to standard cotton varieties. This form exhibits distinct leaf and flower structures, which may contribute to its adaptation to specific environmental conditions. The plant is native to Central America and is of interest for its potential in breeding programs. Its study provides insights into the genetic diversity within the cotton genus."
