    "intro": "Grewia permagna, commonly known as the giant sour fig, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, greenish fruits that turn red when mature. The fruit is edible, though it has a tart flavor, and is used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
