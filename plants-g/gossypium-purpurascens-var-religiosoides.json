    "intro": "Gossypium purpurascens var. religiosoides, commonly known as the sacred cotton or religious cotton, is a variant of the cotton plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant purple flowers and fluffy, woolly seed capsules, which are distinct from the more common white cotton varieties. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Its botanical features include hairy stems and leaves, and it produces small, showy blossoms that attract pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and cultural significance, it is occasionally cultivated for both decorative and symbolic purposes."
