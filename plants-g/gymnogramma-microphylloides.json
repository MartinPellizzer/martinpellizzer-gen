    "intro": "Gymnogramma microphylloides, commonly known as the small-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and colonize moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. Gymnogramma microphylloides is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded areas such as forest floors and rock crevices."
