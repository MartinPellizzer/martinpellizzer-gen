    "intro": "Galanthus elwesii subsp. melihae, commonly known as the Melihae snowdrop, is a rare and elegant member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate white flowers with green markings, which bloom in early spring. Native to the mountainous regions of Turkey, this subspecies thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15-20 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and sometimes endangered species in botanical conservation efforts."
