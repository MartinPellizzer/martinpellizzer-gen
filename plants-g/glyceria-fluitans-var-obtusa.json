    "intro": "Glyceria fluitans var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf floating grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that float on the surface of water, with roots submerged in aquatic substrates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as marshes and ponds. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality and ecological stability in wetland ecosystems."
