    "intro": "Gagea kneissea, commonly known as the Balkan spring beauty, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
