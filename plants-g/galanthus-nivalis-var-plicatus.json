    "intro": "Galanthus nivalis var. plicatus, commonly known as the pleated snowdrop, is a rare and ornamental variant of the snowdrop genus. It is characterized by its distinctive, pleated leaves and delicate, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, this plant thrives in woodland and shaded environments. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps protect it from frost. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by botanists and gardeners alike."
