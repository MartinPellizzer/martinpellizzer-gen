    "intro": "Geniostoma rupestre, commonly known as the rock heath, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
