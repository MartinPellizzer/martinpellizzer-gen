    "intro": "Grumilea papillata, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually short and rounded, with a hairy texture that gives it its common name. Grumilea papillata is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the capture of prey for nutrition."
