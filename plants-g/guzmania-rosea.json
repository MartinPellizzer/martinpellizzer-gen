    "intro": "Guzmania rosea, commonly known as the pink flamingo plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It features a rosette of vibrant, waxy leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The plant produces a tall inflorescence topped with a showy, pinkish-red bract that resembles a flamingo's beak, giving it its common name. Its foliage is often variegated with red, pink, and white hues, adding to its ornamental appeal. Guzmania rosea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush, colorful appearance."
