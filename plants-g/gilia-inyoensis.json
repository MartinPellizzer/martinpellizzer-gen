    "intro": "Gilia inyoensis, commonly known as Inyo gilia, is a flowering plant native to the Mojave Desert in California and Nevada. It is a member of the Mirbelie family (Boraginaceae) and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments with limited water availability. It blooms during the spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gilia inyoensis is often found in open habitats like slopes and washes, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
