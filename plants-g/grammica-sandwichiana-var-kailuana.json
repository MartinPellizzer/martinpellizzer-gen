    "intro": "Grammica sandwichiana var. kailuana, commonly known as the Kailua fern, is a tropical plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that grow in a rosette pattern. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in coastal areas or on rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
