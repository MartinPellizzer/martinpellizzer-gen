    "intro": "Glechoma pycnantha, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Glechoma pycnantha is known for its ability to spread rapidly through runners, making it both a valuable ground cover and a potential weed in gardens."
