    "intro": "Galium migrans subsp. inversum, commonly known as the reverse-stembed bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its stems are often covered in fine hairs, and the leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly serrated margin. This subspecies is distinguished by its unique growth pattern, where the stem appears to reverse direction as it grows, giving it its common name."
