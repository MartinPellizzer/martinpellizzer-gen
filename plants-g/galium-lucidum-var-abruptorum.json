    "intro": "Galium lucidum var. abruptorum, commonly known as the glossy bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, often hairy stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
