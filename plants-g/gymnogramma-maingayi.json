    "intro": "Gymnogramma maingayi, commonly known as the Maingay's spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, lanceolate leaves with a serrated margin, and its fronds are often clustered closely together. Gymnogramma maingayi produces spores in compact, spherical clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady, humid environments."
