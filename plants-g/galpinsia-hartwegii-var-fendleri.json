    "intro": "Galpinsia hartwegii var. fendleri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive seed heads that disperse seeds via the wind. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a hairy texture, while the stems are often reddish in color. This species is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or rocky soils."
