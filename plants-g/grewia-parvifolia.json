    "intro": "Grewia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved gumtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Grewia parvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
