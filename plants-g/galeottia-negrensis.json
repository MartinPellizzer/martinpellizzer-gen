    "intro": "Galeottia negrensis, commonly known as the Negros galeottia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its distinctive spathe and spadix inflorescence. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid and nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for pollination by insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Galeottia negrensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
