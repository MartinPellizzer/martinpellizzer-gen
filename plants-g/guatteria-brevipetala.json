    "intro": "Guatteria brevipetala, commonly known as the short-petioled guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Guatteria brevipetala is often found in humid, lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
