    "intro": "Gasteranthus glaber, commonly known as the naked bellflower, is a striking member of the Rubiaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, thriving on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually smooth and glabrous, giving it the species name \"glaber.\" The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure."
