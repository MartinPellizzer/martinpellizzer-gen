    "intro": "Galium pumilum var. laxius, commonly known as the slender woodspurry, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features small, opposite leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape, with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. These flowers are followed by small, triangular berries that mature to a dark red color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
