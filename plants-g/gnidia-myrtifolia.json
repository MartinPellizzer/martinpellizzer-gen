    "intro": "Gnidia myrtifolia, commonly known as the red-flowered gnidia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release seeds. Gnidia myrtifolia is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
