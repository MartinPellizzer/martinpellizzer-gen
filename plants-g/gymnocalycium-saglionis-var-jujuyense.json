    "intro": "Gymnocalycium saglionis var. jujuyense, commonly known as the Jujuy cholla, is a spineless cactus native to the dry valleys of Argentina. It features a cylindrical stem covered with areoles that produce clusters of white, woolly flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday. It is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
