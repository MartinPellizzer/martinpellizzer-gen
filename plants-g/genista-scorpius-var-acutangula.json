It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are narrow, linear, and sharply pointed, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
