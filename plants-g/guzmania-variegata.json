    "intro": "Guzmania variegata, commonly known as the Variegated Guzmania, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that can range from red to orange, often contrasting with its broad, strap-like foliage. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish. Its rosette-shaped leaves collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small invertebrates. Guzmania variegata is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
