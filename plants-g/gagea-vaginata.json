    "intro": "Gagea vaginata, commonly known as the white false onion, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a scape above the foliage. Its bulbs are small and rounded, often covered in a papery sheath, and serve as storage organs for the plant. Gagea vaginata is typically found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
