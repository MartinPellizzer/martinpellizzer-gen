    "intro": "Gastrochilus nilagiricus, commonly known as the Nilagiri orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Western Ghats in India. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a single, slender stem that produces a cluster of pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically blooms during the summer months, and its flowers have a unique, spurred structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
