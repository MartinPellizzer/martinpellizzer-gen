    "intro": "Galenia fruticosa var. prostrata, commonly known as prostrate galenia, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features wiry, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Galenia fruticosa var. prostrata is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
