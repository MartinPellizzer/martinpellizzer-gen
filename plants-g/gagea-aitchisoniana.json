    "intro": "Gagea aitchisoniana, commonly known as the Aitchison's spring beauty, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink. The plant typically blooms in early spring, making it a notable early-flowering species. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
