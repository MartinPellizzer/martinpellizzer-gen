    "intro": "Grammitis prionodes, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of ferns. Grammitis prionodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
