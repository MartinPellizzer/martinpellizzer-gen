    "intro": "Gentiana asclepiadea f. schistocalyx, commonly known as the rock gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring well-drained and sunny conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
