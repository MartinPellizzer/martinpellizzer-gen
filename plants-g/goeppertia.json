    "intro": "Goeppertia, commonly known as the zebra plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Marantaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. They are characterized by their striking, variegated leaves that often feature bold patterns of green, white, and red. Goeppertia species are typically grown as houseplants due to their attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require consistent moisture and humidity to flourish."
