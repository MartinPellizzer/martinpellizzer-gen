    "intro": "Genista trigonelloides, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky areas. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
