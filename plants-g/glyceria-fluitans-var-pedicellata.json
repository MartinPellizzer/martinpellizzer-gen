    "intro": "Glyceria fluitans var. pedicellata, commonly known as the floating bamboo or water bamboo, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments. It features slender, grass-like stems that grow horizontally along the water's surface, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted for buoyancy and photosynthesis in aquatic conditions. This variety is often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams, contributing to aquatic ecosystem stability."
