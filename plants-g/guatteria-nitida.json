    "intro": "Guatteria nitida, commonly known as the white-flowered guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. Guatteria nitida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
