It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Grevillea brachystylis is often used in coastal gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
