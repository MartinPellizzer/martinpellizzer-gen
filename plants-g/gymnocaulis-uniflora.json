    "intro": "Gymnocaulis uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces a single, erect spore-bearing structure called a strobilus, which is typically located at the tip of the stem. Gymnocaulis uniflora thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
