It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its latex sap is milky and contains compounds that can be toxic to some animals. Galactia hassleriana is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
