    "intro": "Gentiana lutea subsp. vardjanii, commonly known as the yellow gentian, is a member of the Gentianaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which are typically tubular and bilaterally symmetrical. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It blooms during the summer months, producing clusters of bright yellow petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
