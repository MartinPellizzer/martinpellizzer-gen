    "intro": "Geranium potentilloides var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has slender, upright stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are notably smaller than those of the typical species, giving it its varietal name \"microphyllum.\" It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
