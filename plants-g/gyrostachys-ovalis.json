    "intro": "Gyrostachys ovalis, commonly known as the narrowleaf false nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, elliptical fruits. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Gyrostachys ovalis is often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds."
