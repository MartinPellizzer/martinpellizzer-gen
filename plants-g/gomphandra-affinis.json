    "intro": "Gomphandra affinis, commonly known as the slender gomphandra, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as under forest canopies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
