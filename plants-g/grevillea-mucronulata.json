    "intro": "Grevillea mucronulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waratah, is a striking shrub native to the coastal regions of southern and western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, narrow leaves and showy, red or pink flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited to coastal and sandy environments. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters, which feed on its nectar. Grevillea mucronulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
