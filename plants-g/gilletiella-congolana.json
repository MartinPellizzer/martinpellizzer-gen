    "intro": "Gilletiella congolana, commonly known as the Congo cycad, is a unique plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a rare and ecologically significant species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
