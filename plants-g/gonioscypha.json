    "intro": "Gonioscypha, commonly known as the \"stinking sponge,\" is a genus of marine algae belonging to the order Ectocarpales. It is characterized by its gelatinous, sponge-like thallus that often emits a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant typically grows in shallow coastal waters and is found in temperate to tropical regions. Gonioscypha species are usually filamentous or branched, with a complex structure that includes both unicellular and multicellular components. These algae play a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for small organisms."
