    "intro": "Grastidium clavuligerum, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet with two bracts. Grastidium clavuligerum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
