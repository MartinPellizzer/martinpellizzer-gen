It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Glandularia dissecta has glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which can release a sticky substance. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and roadside ditches."
