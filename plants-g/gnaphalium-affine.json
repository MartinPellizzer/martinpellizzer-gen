    "intro": "Gnaphalium affine, commonly known as the common everlasting, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces a large number of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its widespread distribution. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gnaphalium affine is often found in disturbed soils and is used in herbal medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties."
