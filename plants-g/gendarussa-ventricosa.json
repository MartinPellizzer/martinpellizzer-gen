    "intro": "Gendarussa ventricosa, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by orange-red fruits resembling small, rounded capsules. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits, and the plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal. Gendarussa ventricosa thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks."
