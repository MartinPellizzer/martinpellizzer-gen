    "intro": "Glaux maritima var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved sea bladder, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like stems that store water, aiding in survival in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, and it thrives in intertidal zones. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, further contributing to its ability to retain moisture. This variety is often found in coastal regions of Europe and North America."
