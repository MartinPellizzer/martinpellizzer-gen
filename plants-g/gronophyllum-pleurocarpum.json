    "intro": "Gronophyllum pleurocarpum, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, characterized by its small, yellow flowers and rough, thorny stems. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, which is often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal water availability."
