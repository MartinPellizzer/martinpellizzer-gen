It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, lance-shaped leaves that display a distinctive yellow to orange variegation. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 feet, with clusters of tubular, brightly colored flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow.
