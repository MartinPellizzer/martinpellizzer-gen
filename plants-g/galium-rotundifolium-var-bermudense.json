    "intro": "Galium rotundifolium var. bermudense, commonly known as Bermuda nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Bermuda and parts of the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas and in disturbed habitats. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are round or heart-shaped, and it has a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid spread and ability to form dense mats."
