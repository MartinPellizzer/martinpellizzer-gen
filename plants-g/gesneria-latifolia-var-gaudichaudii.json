    "intro": "Gesneria latifolia var. gaudichaudii, commonly known as the Gaudichaud's gesneria, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It features broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red or orange, which bloom during the warm season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
