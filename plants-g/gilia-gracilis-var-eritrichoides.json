It is a herbaceous annual with slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are characterized by five petals and are pollinated primarily by insects. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
