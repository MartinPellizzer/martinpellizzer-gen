    "intro": "Gloneria jasminiflora, commonly known as the jasmine-flowered glomeria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that resemble jasmine. The plant typically grows as an epiphytic orchid, often found clinging to tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and glossy, and it produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow blossoms. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservatories."
