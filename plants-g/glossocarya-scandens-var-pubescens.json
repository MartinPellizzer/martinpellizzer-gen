    "intro": "Glossocarya scandens var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy climbing glossocarya, is a perennial vine native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features slender, woody stems that climb using adventitious roots, often found in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by elliptical, leathery fruits. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and covered with fine, pubescent hairs, giving it its varietal name. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and other wildlife."
