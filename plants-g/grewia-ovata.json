    "intro": "Grewia ovata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or sour fig, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to spherical, fleshy fruits resembling small figs. These fruits are edible, though they have a tart flavor and are often used in local cuisines or traditional medicine. Grewia ovata thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
