    "intro": "Galanthus lagodechianus, commonly known as the Lagodekhi snowdrop, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh winters, allowing it to emerge when conditions are favorable. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
