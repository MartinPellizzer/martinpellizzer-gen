    "intro": "Gunnera quitoensis, commonly known as the Quito giant shield fern, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Gunneraceae family and is characterized by its massive, shield-shaped leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. Its large, palmate leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from intense sunlight and frost. The plant is also notable for its unique reproductive structures, including small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into berries."
