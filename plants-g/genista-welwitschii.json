    "intro": "Genista welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its dense, thorny foliage. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually small and scale-like, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Genista welwitschii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
