It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green berries. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine regions. Its berries are edible but not widely cultivated for commercial purposes. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
