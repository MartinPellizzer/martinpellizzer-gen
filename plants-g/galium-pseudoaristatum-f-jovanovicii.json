    "intro": "Galium pseudoaristatum f. jovanovicii, commonly known as the Jovanovi\u0107's bedstraw, is a variant of the bedstraw genus characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, white to pale pink flowers. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant produces tiny, bead-like fruits called drupes, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This form is considered a rare and localized variant within the broader Galium pseudoaristatum species complex."
