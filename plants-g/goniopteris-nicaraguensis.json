It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are often adorned with small, rounded lobes that give it a unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
