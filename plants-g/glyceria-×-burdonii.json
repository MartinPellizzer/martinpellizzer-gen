    "intro": "Glyceria \u00d7 burdonii, commonly known as the Burdon's glyceria, is a hybrid grass species native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, making it monoecious. It thrives in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Glyceria \u00d7 burdonii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
