    "intro": "Galium nitidum, commonly known as glossy bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, shiny hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating that contributes to its glossy appearance. Galium nitidum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
