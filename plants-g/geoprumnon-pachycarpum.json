    "intro": "Geoprumnon pachycarpum, commonly known as the thick-fruited geoprumnon, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its thick, fleshy fruits. It belongs to the family Geoprumnonaceae and is native to specific regions with particular soil and climate conditions. The plant exhibits a woody stem with dense, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, while the fruits mature to a deep purple or black color. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
