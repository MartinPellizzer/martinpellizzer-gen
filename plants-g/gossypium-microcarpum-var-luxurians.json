    "intro": "Gossypium microcarpum var. luxurians, commonly known as the Mexican cotton plant, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its small, hairy leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, fluffy bolls that contain fibers used for textile purposes. It thrives in warm, arid climates and is adapted to poor soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated cotton species."
