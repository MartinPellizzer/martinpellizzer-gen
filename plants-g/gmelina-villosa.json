It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and long, slender leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks.
