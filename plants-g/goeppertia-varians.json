    "intro": "Goeppertia varians, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a striking member of the Marantaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, mottled leaves that display shades of green, red, and purple, often with a distinctive zebra-like pattern. The plant typically grows as an upright perennial with thick, fleshy stems and broad, lance-shaped foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers consistently moist, well-draining soil. Goeppertia varians is popular as a decorative indoor plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
