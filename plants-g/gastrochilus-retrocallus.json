    "intro": "Gastrochilus retrocallus, commonly known as the reticulate slipper orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique slipper-shaped pouch, which is a key feature in its pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on tree trunks or rocks, and requires specific humidity and temperature conditions to thrive. Its flowers are usually small, with a striking combination of purple and white hues, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gastrochilus retrocallus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
