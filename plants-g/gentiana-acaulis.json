    "intro": "Gentiana acaulis, commonly known as the nodding gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in high-altitude environments where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture. Gentiana acaulis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
