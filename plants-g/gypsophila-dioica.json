    "intro": "Gypsophila dioica, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like inflorescences composed of numerous small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves. Gypsophila dioica is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities, where it plays a minor but ecologically significant role."
