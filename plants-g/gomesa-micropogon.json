    "intro": "Gomesa micropogon, commonly known as the narrow-headed gomesia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or sandy soils, and prefers cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are small and white or pale pink in color. Gomesa micropogon is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
