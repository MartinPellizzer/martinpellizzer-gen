    "intro": "Gnaphalium stolonatum, commonly known as the creeping cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with thin, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, surrounded by fine, hairy bracts. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with dense, white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Gnaphalium stolonatum is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
