    "intro": "Gentianella trailliana var. beesiana, commonly known as the Beesia gentian, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in open meadows or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
