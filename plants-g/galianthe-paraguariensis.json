    "intro": "Galianthe paraguariensis, commonly known as the Paraguayan coffee plant, is a species native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like fruits containing the seeds used for coffee. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a source of Paraguayan coffee, which is distinct from traditional Arabica and Robusta varieties."
