    "intro": "Goniopteris littoralis, commonly known as the coastal fern, is a species of fern that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often broad and feather-shaped. This plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing capsules, are located on the underside of its fronds. Goniopteris littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small organisms."
