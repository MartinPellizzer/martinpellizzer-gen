    "intro": "[WRONG START] Griffitharia sharmaa, commonly known as the Sharma's ghost tree, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the remote mountainous regions of northeastern India. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often twisted leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to thrive in high-altitude, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces a distinctive, milky latex sap. Due to habitat loss and limited study, Griffitharia sharmae remains a poorly understood species with significant conservation concerns."
