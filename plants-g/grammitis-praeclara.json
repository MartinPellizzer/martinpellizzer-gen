    "intro": "Grammitis praeclara, commonly known as the shining fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in rainforests. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Grammitis praeclara is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
