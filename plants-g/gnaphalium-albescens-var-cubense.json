    "intro": "Gnaphalium albescens var. cubense, commonly known as the Cuban white cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its flowers are small, white, and produce a fine, powdery substance known as a bloom, which is a common feature in the genus Gnaphalium. This variety is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of G. albescens."
