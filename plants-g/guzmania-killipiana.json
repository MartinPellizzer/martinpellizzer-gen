    "intro": "Guzmania killipiana, commonly known as the Killip's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Colombia. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range from red to orange. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool that supports small aquatic life. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. Guzmania killipiana is popular as a ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
