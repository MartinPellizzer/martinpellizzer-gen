    "intro": "Gaultheria myrtilloides var. racemosa, commonly known as the clustered wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically features dense, dark green foliage with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a tart, cranberry-like flavor, often used in local cuisine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
