    "intro": "Glischrocaryon, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plants produce showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often blooming during the rainy season. They are shrubs or small trees with woody stems and are often used in traditional medicine. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
