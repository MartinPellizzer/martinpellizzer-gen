    "intro": "Gastrodia pubilabiata, commonly known as the hairy stomach orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its compact, fleshy rhizome and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high levels of shade, often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
