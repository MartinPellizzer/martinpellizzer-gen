    "intro": "Guzmania cundinamarcae, commonly known as the Cundinamarca bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the humid forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range from red to orange in color. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small invertebrates. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts."
