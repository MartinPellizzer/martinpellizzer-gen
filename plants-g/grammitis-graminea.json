    "intro": "Grammitis graminea, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Huperjaniaceae and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, clustered spore-producing structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and form a network that anchors it to substrates, while its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in dense tufts. Grammitis graminea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
