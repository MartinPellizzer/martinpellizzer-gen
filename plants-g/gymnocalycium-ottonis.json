    "intro": "Gymnocalycium ottonis, commonly known as the Otto's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces striking, pale yellow to orange flowers during the summer months. It is a slow-growing species that prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and compact size, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
