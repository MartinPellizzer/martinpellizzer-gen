    "intro": "Gomphocarpus fruticosus var. angustissimus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. This variety is particularly adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
