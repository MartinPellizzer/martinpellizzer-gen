    "intro": "Greenea montana, commonly known as the mountain greenea, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It is often found in alpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Greenea montana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
