It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its stems are erect with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Geum umbrosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, attracting pollinators like butterflies and bees."
