    "intro": "Glossorhyncha pilifera, commonly known as the hairy-tongued orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, hairy lips that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive coloration that ranges from white to pale yellow. The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among many orchid species."
