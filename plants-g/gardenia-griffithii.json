    "intro": "Gardenia griffithii, commonly known as the golden gardenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Andaman Islands. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, wax-like flowers that range from white to yellow. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-draining soil and partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively disease-resistant. However, it is sensitive to frost and requires careful care to maintain its health and bloom."
