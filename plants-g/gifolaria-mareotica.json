It is a perennial herb characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to the harsh environments of the Egyptian coast. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a valuable species for ecological studies in arid and semi-arid regions."
