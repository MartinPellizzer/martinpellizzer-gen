    "intro": "Grevillea, commonly known as the \"kangaroo paw,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to Australia. These plants are characterized by their unique, often brightly colored, flower spikes that resemble the paw of a kangaroo. Grevilleas are typically shrubs or small trees, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. They thrive in well-drained soils and are adapted to a variety of climatic conditions, making them popular in horticulture. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to attract native pollinators."
