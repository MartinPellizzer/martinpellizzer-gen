    "intro": "Geissanthus durifolius, commonly known as the hard-leaved geissanthus, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, arid conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in cloud forests or mountainous areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
