    "intro": "Gymnogramma regularis, commonly known as the common gymnogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in small, circular sori. Gymnogramma regularis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it a popular subject in both horticulture and botanical studies."
