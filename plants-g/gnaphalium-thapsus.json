    "intro": "Gnaphalium thapsus, commonly known as field sandwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and coastal areas. Its small, white to yellowish flowers bloom in summer, and the plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Gnaphalium thapsus is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
