    "intro": "Glyceria aquatica var. debilior, commonly known as slender watergrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in temperate regions of North America and parts of Europe. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in aquatic conditions."
