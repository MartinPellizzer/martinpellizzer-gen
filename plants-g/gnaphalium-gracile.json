    "intro": "Gnaphalium gracile, commonly known as slender featherweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing herb with slender, hairy stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Gnaphalium gracile is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in sandy or gravelly areas."
