    "intro": "Graphorkis cucullata, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, hood-like floral structure that encloses the reproductive organs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understoreys where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators like bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Graphorkis cucullata is considered endangered and is protected in many countries."
