    "intro": "Glossogyne integrifolia, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. It has a trailing growth habit and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Glossogyne integrifolia is adapted to saline and wind-swept conditions, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
