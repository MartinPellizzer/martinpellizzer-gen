    "intro": "Grastidium finetianum, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It possesses a fibrous root system that allows it to anchor itself to tree trunks while absorbing moisture from the humid air. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves covered in a dense layer of silver-colored trichomes, which reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically appear in clusters, displaying shades of white and pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Grastidium finetianum is considered a vulnerable species."
