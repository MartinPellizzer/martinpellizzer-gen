It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes with cool temperatures. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss.
