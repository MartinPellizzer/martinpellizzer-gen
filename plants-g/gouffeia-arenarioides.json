    "intro": "Gouffeia arenarioides, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, reducing water loss through transpiration. Gouffeia arenarioides is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
