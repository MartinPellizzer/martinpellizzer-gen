    "intro": "Gibbaria, commonly known as the blue coneflower, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and vibrant flowers. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it store water in arid environments. Its showy, five-petaled flowers come in shades of blue, purple, and white, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Gibbaria thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
