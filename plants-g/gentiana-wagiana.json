    "intro": "Gentiana wagiana, commonly known as the Tibetan gentian, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
