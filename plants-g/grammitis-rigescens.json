    "intro": "Grammitis rigescens, commonly known as the rigid fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rigid, upright growth habit. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it often grows on trees or rocks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Grammitis rigescens is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden environments."
