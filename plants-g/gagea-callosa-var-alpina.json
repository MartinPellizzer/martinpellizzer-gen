    "intro": "Gagea callosa var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine gagea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered bulbs and delicate, grass-like foliage. The plant produces bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are often adorned with a distinctive purple or red stripe. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
