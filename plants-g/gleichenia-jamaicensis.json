    "intro": "Gleichenia jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive, lobed structure with a creeping rhizome and erect, lance-shaped leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Gleichenia jamaicensis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
