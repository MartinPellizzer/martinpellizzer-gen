    "intro": "Galium harcynicum var. riparium, commonly known as the riparian bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to riparian zones in Europe. It typically grows in moist, sandy or gravelly soils along riverbanks and stream edges. The plant features slender, ascending stems with opposite, small ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are white or pale pink, clustered in umbels, and it produces small, bead-like fruits. It plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
