    "intro": "Glyceria distans var. pedicellata, commonly known as the slender glyceria, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in conditions with partial to full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that contribute to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic life."
