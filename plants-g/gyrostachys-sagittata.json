It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are arrow-shaped, which gives it its common name, and are usually covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Gyrostachys sagittata is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
