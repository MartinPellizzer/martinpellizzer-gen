    "intro": "Gaya woodii, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its striking clusters of yellow flowers that appear in the spring. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain several winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Gaya woodii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in gardens and along streets for its vibrant floral display."
