    "intro": "Galeopsis pubescens var. minor, commonly known as lesser hedge-nettle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its widespread distribution and ecological adaptability, it plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
