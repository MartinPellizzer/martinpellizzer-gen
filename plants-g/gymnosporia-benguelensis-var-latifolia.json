It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a pinnate pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
