    "intro": "Goniopteris penangiana, commonly known as the Penang spleenwort, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist rock surfaces or in shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich environments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Goniopteris penangiana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
