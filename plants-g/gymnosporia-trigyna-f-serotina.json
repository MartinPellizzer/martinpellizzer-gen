    "intro": "Gymnosporia trigyna f. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering three-ovary gymnosporia, is a variant of the gymnosporia species characterized by its delayed flowering period. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is native to certain regions of southern Africa. The plant is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, showing adaptations to arid environments. Its leaves are simple and opposite, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that appear in late summer or early autumn. The fruit is a capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in harsh conditions."
