    "intro": "Glyceria fluitans subsp. spicata, commonly known as the spike-flowered watergrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. Glyceria fluitans subsp. spicata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and waterfowl."
