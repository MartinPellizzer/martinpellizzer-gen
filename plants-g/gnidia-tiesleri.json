    "intro": "Gnidia tiesleri, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a member of the Rubiaceae family. It is a small to medium-sized tree native to southern Africa, characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by orange-red fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodlands and savannas. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for traditional purposes."
