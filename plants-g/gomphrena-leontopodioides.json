    "intro": "Gomphrena leontopodioides, commonly known as the woolly globe thistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive spherical, spiky inflorescences that resemble small globes, typically in shades of pink, red, or purple. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Gomphrena leontopodioides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
