    "intro": "Galium parisiense var. divaricatum, commonly known as the creeping wood-sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, branched stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinct veining pattern, and its flowers are white, five-petaled, and clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it adaptable to a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions."
