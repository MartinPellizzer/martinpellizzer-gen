    "intro": "Grevillea amplifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed grevillea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often adorned with vibrant red or orange markings. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-like flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Grevillea amplifolia is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract native birds and insects."
