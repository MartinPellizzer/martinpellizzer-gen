    "intro": "Graphorkis venulosa, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for survival. Due to habitat loss and its secretive nature, Graphorkis venulosa is considered a critically endangered species."
