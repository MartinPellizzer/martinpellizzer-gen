    "intro": "Goniopteris schwackeana, commonly known as the Schwacke's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its fronds are typically divided into numerous small, finger-like segments called pinnae. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
