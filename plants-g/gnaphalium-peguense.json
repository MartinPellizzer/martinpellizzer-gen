    "intro": "Gnaphalium peguense, commonly known as the Peguense cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Malaysia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its small, yellowish flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Gnaphalium peguense is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
