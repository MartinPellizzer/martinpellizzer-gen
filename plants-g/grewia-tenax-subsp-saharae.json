    "intro": "Grewia tenax subsp. saharae, commonly known as the Saharan grewia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, attracting various bird species. This subspecies is well-suited to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in scrublands and coastal areas."
