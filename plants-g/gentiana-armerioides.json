    "intro": "Gentiana armerioides, commonly known as the blue gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, blue-green berries that contain the seeds. Gentiana armerioides thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
