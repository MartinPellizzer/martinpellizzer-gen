    "intro": "Galium intricatum var. zacynthium, commonly known as the Zacynthian bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly the island of Zakynthos. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its delicate appearance and restricted distribution make it a notable species in its native habitat."
