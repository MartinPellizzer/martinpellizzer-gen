    "intro": "Gethyllis barkerae subsp. paucifolia, commonly known as the sparse-leaved gethyllis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, showy flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced number of leaves, typically fewer than six, which are often narrow and grass-like. It produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
