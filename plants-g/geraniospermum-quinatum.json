It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and appear in clusters during the rainy season. Geraniospermum quinatum is adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability."
