    "intro": "Grevillea obtusiflora, commonly known as the broad-flowered grevillea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and lance-shaped. The plant produces vibrant, showy red or orange flowers clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. These flowers are adapted for pollination by nectar-feeding birds, particularly honeyeaters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens."
