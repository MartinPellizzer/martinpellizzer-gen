    "intro": "Goniophlebium semipinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often divided into narrow, lobed segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually evergreen, with a feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in distinct patterns."
