    "intro": "Guzmania nubigena, commonly known as the cloud forest bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the humid rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange, often resembling a torch. The plant features a rosette of narrow, pointed leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and insects. Its unique structure allows it to thrive in shaded, high-altitude environments where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Guzmania nubigena is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements."
