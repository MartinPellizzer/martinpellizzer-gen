It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a vibrant touch to its foliage. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its yellow blooms. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid and semi-arid climates."
