    "intro": "Guidonia spinescens, commonly known as the spiny guidonia, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to rocky or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
