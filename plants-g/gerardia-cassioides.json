    "intro": "Gerardia cassioides, commonly known as the creeping gerardia, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, branching stems that root at the nodes. Its small, opposite leaves are elliptical and have a slightly rough texture. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and appear in clusters, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
