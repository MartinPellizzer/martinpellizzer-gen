    "intro": "Gymnotrix nubica, commonly known as the cloud mist orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It thrives in cool, humid environments, often growing in cloud forests where it receives diffuse sunlight. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its misty habitat. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically display a range of white and pale purple hues. Due to its specific ecological requirements, Gymnotrix nubica is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in its natural range."
