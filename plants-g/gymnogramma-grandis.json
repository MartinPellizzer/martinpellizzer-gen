    "intro": "Gymnogramma grandis, commonly known as the giant wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, and often lobed fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, forming dense colonies. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across suitable habitats. Gymnogramma grandis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage."
