It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by indehiscent capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
