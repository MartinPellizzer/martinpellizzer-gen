    "intro": "Gnaphalium strictum, commonly known as slender cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a compact, upright stem with small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like flower heads composed of white to pale yellow florets, which bloom in late summer. It is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Its aromatic foliage and ability to thrive in shaded areas make it a common sight in various ecological settings."
