    "intro": "Gastrodia verrucosa, commonly known as the rough gastrodia, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores energy and supports its growth. It flowers in late summer, producing small, white to pale yellow blossoms that are often overlooked due to their modest size. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Gastrodia verrucosa is critically endangered and protected in many regions."
