    "intro": "Gilia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of only a few inches. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Gilia pygmaea thrives in rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its short stature and vibrant blooms make it a distinctive and ornamental species in its native habitat."
