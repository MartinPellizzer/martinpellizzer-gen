    "intro": "Gagea kuraiensis, commonly known as the Kurai mountain scilla, is a rare perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gagea kuraiensis is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change."
