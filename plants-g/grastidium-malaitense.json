It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its resilience and adaptability, it plays a role in local ecosystems and has potential for use in erosion control."
