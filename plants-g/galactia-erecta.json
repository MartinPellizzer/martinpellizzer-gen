It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its hairy stems and leaves are adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Galactia erecta is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun."
