    "intro": "Grindelia foliosa, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Grindelia foliosa is a hardy species adapted to extreme temperatures and low precipitation."
