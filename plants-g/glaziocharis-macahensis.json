    "intro": "Glaziocharis macahensis, commonly known as the Mexican snowbell, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silvery down. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
