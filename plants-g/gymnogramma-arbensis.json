    "intro": "Gymnogramma arbensis, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 20 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that spread along the ground, allowing it to colonize shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive shield-like appearance on the underside. Gymnogramma arbensis is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, low-light conditions."
