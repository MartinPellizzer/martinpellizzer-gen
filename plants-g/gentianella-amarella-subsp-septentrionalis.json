    "intro": "Gentianella amarella subsp. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern gentian, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
