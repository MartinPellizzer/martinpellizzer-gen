    "intro": "Globba flavibracteata, commonly known as the golden bract globba, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces striking, yellowish-orange bracts that are often mistaken for flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a fan-like pattern. Globba flavibracteata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens due to its vibrant appearance and hardy nature."
