    "intro": "Geum ponticum, commonly known as meadow avens, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Geum ponticum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and stream banks."
