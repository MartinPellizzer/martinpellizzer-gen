    "intro": "Gynura ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori shield fern, is a unique fern species native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically broad and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and mountainous areas. Its fronds are usually dark green with a rough, textured surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures. Gynura ruwenzoriensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
