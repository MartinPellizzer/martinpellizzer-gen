    "intro": "Gesneria verdii, commonly known as the velvetleaf gesneria, is a species native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is a evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30 cm, featuring broad, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in the summer months. Gesneria verdii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
