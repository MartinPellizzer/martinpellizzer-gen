    "intro": "Goodyera chilanensis, commonly known as the Chilian twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central America and parts of South America. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The species produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that are arranged in a spike, often with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Goodyera chilanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
