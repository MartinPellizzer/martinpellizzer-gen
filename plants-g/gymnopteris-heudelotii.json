    "intro": "Gymnopteris heudelotii, commonly known as the Heudelot's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. Gymnopteris heudelotii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
