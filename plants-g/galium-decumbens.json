It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Galium decumbens thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
