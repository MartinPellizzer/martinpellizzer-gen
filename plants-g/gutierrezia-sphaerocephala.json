    "intro": "Gutierrezia sphaerocephala, commonly known as the globe-globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by spherical, tan seed heads that give the plant its common name. Gutierrezia sphaerocephala is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
