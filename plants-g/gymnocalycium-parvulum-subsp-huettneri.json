    "intro": "Gymnocalycium parvulum subsp. huettneri, commonly known as the Huettner's moon cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, thick stem covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stem, making it well adapted to drought conditions. This subspecies is prized in horticulture for its compact size and ornamental appeal."
