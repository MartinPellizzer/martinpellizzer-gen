    "intro": "Galium insubricum, commonly known as the creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, giving the plant a slightly fuzzy appearance. Galium insubricum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
