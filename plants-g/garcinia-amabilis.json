    "intro": "Garcinia amabilis, commonly known as the Malabar tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of India and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles. The tree bears fruit that resembles a small, sour orange, with a thin, leathery rind and a juicy, acidic pulp. The fruit is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary ingredient due to its tart flavor. Botanically, it belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
