    "intro": "Gossia pubiflora, commonly known as the woolly gossia, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Gossia pubiflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
