It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators."
