    "intro": "Galactia savannarum, commonly known as the Florida milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found in open habitats such as sandhills and pine flatwoods. Galactia savannarum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
