    "intro": "Govenia greenwoodii, commonly known as the greenwood's govenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its botanical features include small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pale pink blooms that appear in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
