    "intro": "Glyceria norvegica, commonly known as northern glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet, marshy habitats and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic properties. Glyceria norvegica plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
