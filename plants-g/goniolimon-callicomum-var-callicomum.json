    "intro": "Goniolimon callicomum var. callicomum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb with slender, often branched stems that grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. This species is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
