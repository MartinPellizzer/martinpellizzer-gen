    "intro": "Gagea spathacea var. transcarpatica, commonly known as the Transcarpathian spring beauty, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Carpathian region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in woodland and meadow habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its range."
