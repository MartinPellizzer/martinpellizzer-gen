    "intro": "Gymnocalycium stellatum var. minimum, commonly known as the miniature star cactus, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Argentina. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with a short, thick neck and is covered in small, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but striking. Its small size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation. It requires minimal water and thrives in bright, indirect light."
