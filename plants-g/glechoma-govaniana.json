    "intro": "Glechoma govaniana, commonly known as the creeping jellyplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread readily. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by heart-shaped, serrated leaves. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss. Glechoma govaniana is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
