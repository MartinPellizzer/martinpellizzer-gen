    "intro": "Glycine hispida var. nigricans-lutescens, commonly known as the golden shower tree or *Spathodea campanulata*, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release winged seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
