    "intro": "Gagea glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Its bulbs are fibrous and store nutrients, allowing the plant to survive in temperate climates. Gagea glaucescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
