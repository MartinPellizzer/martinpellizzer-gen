    "intro": "Grammitis hessii, commonly known as the Hess's fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Grammitis hessii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
