    "intro": "Gunnera monoica var. albocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited giant shield fern, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, providing a dramatic visual presence. The plant produces showy, spadix-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in temperate climates. The white-fruited variant is distinguished by its distinctive, white, fleshy fruits that develop after flowering."
