    "intro": "Genista \u00d7 rivasgodayana, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a hybrid shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, spiny growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, leathery pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and Mediterranean regions. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain areas."
