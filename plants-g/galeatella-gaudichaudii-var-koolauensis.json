    "intro": "Galeatella gaudichaudii var. koolauensis, commonly known as the Koolau fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Hawaii. It is a fern with distinctive fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
