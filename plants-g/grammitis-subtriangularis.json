    "intro": "Grammitis subtriangularis, commonly known as the triangular fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, small, and often clustered fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually narrowly triangular in shape, giving the plant its common name. Grammitis subtriangularis is noted for its intricate venation and is often found in rainforests where high humidity supports its growth."
