    "intro": "Geranium trifolium, commonly known as the three-leaved geranium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Geranium trifolium is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators."
