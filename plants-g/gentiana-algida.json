    "intro": "Gentiana algida, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to retain moisture. Gentiana algida is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
