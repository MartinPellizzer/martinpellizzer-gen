    "intro": "Geocarpon minimum, commonly known as the small earthstar, is a rare and elusive fungal plant that belongs to the family Geoglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique subterranean growth habit, with a small, star-shaped fruiting body that emerges only briefly after rain. The plant produces a distinctive, sticky, dark-colored spore mass that is released into the air. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in woodlands or on forest floors. Due to its rarity and cryptic life cycle, it is considered a challenging subject for botanical study."
