    "intro": "Geunsia beccariana, commonly known as the Beccarian's geunsia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features include a slender stem and a distinct, aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
