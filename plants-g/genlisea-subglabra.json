    "intro": "Genlisea subglabra, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its unique feature is the presence of bladder-like structures used for capturing tiny aquatic organisms. Genlisea subglabra is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes."
