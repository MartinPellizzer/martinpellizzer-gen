    "intro": "Gymnopetalum piperifolium, commonly known as the sweet fern, is a member of the family Ericaceae and is native to the eastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, making it a hardy species found in moist, acidic environments. Gymnopetalum piperifolium is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
