    "intro": "Gynura rubiginosa, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It has a distinctive appearance with large, leathery leaves that form a crinkled, fern-like structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rhizomes anchor it to trees or rocks, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures. Gynura rubiginosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
