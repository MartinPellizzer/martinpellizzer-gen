    "intro": "Gahnia parviflora, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form compact clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on long, slender panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swampy areas, and along stream banks. Gahnia parviflora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
