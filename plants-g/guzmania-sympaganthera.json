    "intro": "Guzmania sympaganthera, commonly known as the red-veined guzmania, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that can range from red to orange, often with contrasting green veins. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a natural habitat for small organisms. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few weeks before the plant produces offsets. Guzmania sympaganthera thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil."
