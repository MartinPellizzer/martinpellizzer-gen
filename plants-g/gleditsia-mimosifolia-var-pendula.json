    "intro": "Gleditsia mimosifolia var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping honeylocust, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller, feather-like segments, and they turn yellow in the fall. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
