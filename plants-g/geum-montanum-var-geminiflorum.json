    "intro": "Geum montanum var. geminiflorum, commonly known as the twin-flower mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are pinnately lobed and covered in fine hairs, and its flowering stems bear clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The flowers are typically arranged in pairs, giving the plant its common name, and bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
