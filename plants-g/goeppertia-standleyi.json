    "intro": "Goeppertia standleyi, commonly known as the Red-tipped Zebra Plant, is a striking member of the Zingiberaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that often display a striking red or pink margin, contrasting with its deep green center. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typical of the ginger family. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Goeppertia standleyi is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
