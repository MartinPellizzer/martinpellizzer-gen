    "intro": "Gynoxys trianae var. nemocona, commonly known as the Nemocona gynoxys, is a species of flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and showy, violet-pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
