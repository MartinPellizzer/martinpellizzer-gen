    "intro": "Graphardisia picturata, commonly known as the painted orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its vivid, often iridescent petals that display intricate patterns, which are thought to play a role in pollination. Native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-draining soil. Its flowers typically bloom during the wet season, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Graphardisia picturata is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
