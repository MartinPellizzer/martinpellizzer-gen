    "intro": "Goniothalamus dolichopetalus var. dolichopetalus, commonly known as the long-petaled goniothalamus, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its striking, elongated petals that often display vibrant colors. The plant typically grows as an evergreen tree or shrub, with smooth, glabrous bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually borne in clusters and emit a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
