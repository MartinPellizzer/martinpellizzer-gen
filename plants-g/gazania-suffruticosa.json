    "intro": "Gazania suffruticosa, commonly known as the rock gazania, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, succulent shrub that typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces vibrant, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the warmer months. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping to conserve moisture in arid environments. Gazania suffruticosa is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
