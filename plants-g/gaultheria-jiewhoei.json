    "intro": "Gaultheria jiewhoei, commonly known as the Yunnan wax myrtle, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many acid-loving plants adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. It produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Gaultheria jiewhoei is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
