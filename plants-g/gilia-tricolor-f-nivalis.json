    "intro": "Gilia tricolor f. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine gilia, is a variant of the three-color gilia native to high-altitude regions of North America. This perennial plant is characterized by its delicate, three-colored flowers that range from white to pink and purple, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it tolerates cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. The plant's leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, adding vibrant color to mountainous landscapes."
