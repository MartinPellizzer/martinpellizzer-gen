    "intro": "Gymnocalycium horridispinum subsp. achirasense, commonly known as the Achira prickly pear, is a cacti species native to northern Argentina. It is characterized by its globose to cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in dry gardens and rockeries."
