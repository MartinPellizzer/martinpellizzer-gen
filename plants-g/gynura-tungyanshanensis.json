    "intro": "Gynura tungyanshanensis, commonly known as the Tungyanshan gynura, is a perennial herb native to southern China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive lobed shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in compact clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
