    "intro": "Geum hirtum, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and features basal leaves that are palmately divided with hairy surfaces. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous, and it often forms dense colonies in moist, well-drained soils. Geum hirtum is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
