    "intro": "Gaillardia amblyodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gaillardia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, showing a preference for full sun. Its vibrant red and yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Gaillardia amblyodon is relatively drought-tolerant, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens."
