It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. It produces small yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its subspecies status reflects minor morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf structure and growth habit."
