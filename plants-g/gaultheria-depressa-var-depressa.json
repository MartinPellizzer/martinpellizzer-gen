    "intro": "Gaultheria depressa var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf strawberry bush, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, edible berries in late summer. These berries are often used in culinary applications and have a tart, slightly sweet flavor. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments."
