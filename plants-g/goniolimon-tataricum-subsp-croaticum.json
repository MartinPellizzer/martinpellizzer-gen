    "intro": "Goniolimon tataricum subsp. croaticum, commonly known as the Croatian tatarian goniolimon, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Croatia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-arid environments. Its morphology includes narrow, grass-like leaves and a low-growing habit, which helps it conserve moisture. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
