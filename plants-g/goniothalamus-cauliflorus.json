    "intro": "Goniothalamus cauliflorus, commonly known as the tropical evergreen tree, is a member of the Magnoliales order and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its cauliflorous flowering habit, where flowers emerge directly from the trunk and branches rather than from the tips of the shoots. The plant has simple, alternate, and often leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive sweet fragrance that attracts various pollinators. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral display."
