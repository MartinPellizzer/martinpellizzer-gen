It is characterized by its striking dark purple to black fruits, which are covered in a thin, white, spongy layer called the pericarp. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil and requires partial shade for optimal growth. The fruit is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its potential health benefits."
