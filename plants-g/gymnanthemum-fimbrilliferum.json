    "intro": "Gymnanthemum fimbrilliferum, commonly known as the fringe-bearing starflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its star-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are erect and branched. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
