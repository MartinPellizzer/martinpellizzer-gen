    "intro": "Geigeria obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved geigeria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassland and savanna habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are broad and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in spring, are small and yellow, forming dense clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
