    "intro": "Giulianettia disticha, commonly known as the two-branched grass, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often branched near the base, giving it its common name. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged in pairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Giulianettia disticha produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish flowers, which are followed by narrow, elongated seeds."
