    "intro": "Galium setaceum var. lasiocarpum, commonly known as the silky bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, ascending stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is distinguished by its hairy fruits, which set it apart from other varieties within the Galium genus."
