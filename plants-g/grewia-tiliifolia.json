    "intro": "Grewia tiliifolia, commonly known as the Indian rose or white bush, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Grewia tiliifolia is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils."
