    "intro": "Galium broterianum var. ovale, commonly known as the broad-leaf bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in cymes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Galium broterianum var. ovale is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it contributes to the undergrowth vegetation."
