    "intro": "Guzmania melinonis, commonly known as the pink guzmania, is a striking tropical bromeliad native to South America. It features a rosette of long, narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for its aerial roots. The plant produces vibrant pink bracts that surround its flowering spikes, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Guzmania melinonis is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and eye-catching appearance."
