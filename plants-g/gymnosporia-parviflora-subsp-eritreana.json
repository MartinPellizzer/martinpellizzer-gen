    "intro": "Gymnosporia parviflora subsp. eritreana, commonly known as the Eritrean dwarf hakea, is a shrub native to the highlands of Eritrea. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces woody, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, typical of the gymnosperm-like features in its name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The subspecies is noted for its resilience to drought and its ecological importance in local habitats."
