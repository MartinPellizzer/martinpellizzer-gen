    "intro": "Guzmania obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's foliage is typically broad and waxy, with vibrant colors ranging from green to red, depending on the variety. It produces striking inflorescences, often with colorful bracts that can last for several months. Guzmania obtusa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil for optimal growth."
