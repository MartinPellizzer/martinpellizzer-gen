    "intro": "Gothofreda solanoides, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent flowers that glow faintly in the dark. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces berries that are toxic to most animals. Due to its extreme habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
