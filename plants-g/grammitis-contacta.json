    "intro": "Grammitis contacta, commonly known as the contact fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on trees or rocks, forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant has slender, wiry stems with closely spaced, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety layer of hair. Its fronds are usually less than 10 cm in length and exhibit a distinctive, compact growth habit. Grammitis contacta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
