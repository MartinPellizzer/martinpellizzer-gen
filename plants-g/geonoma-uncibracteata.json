    "intro": "Geonoma uncibracteata, commonly known as the narrow-bract fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and mountainous areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome sheaths, which help in water retention. The leaves are usually leathery and have a distinctive, elongated shape that aids in photosynthesis in low-light conditions."
