    "intro": "Goniophlebium ciliatum var. hostmannii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a perennial fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its fronds are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
