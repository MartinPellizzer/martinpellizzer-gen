    "intro": "Guettarda elongata, commonly known as the slender guettarda, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, elliptic leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Guettarda elongata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal and humid environments."
