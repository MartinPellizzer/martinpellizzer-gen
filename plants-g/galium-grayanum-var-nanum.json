    "intro": "Galium grayanum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf woodypod, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, bead-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
