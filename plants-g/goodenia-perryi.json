    "intro": "Goodenia perryi, commonly known as the Perry's goodenia, is a flowering plant native to western Australia. It belongs to the Goodeniaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy foliage and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom during the cooler months, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Goodenia perryi is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
