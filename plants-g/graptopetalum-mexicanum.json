The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid environments with minimal care."
