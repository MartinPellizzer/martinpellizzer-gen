    "intro": "Garcinia portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican Garcinia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Clusiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces orange-red berries that are edible but contain high levels of acidity. Garcinia portoricensis is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
