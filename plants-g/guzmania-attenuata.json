    "intro": "Guzmania attenuata, commonly known as the pink flamingo plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, pinkish-red inflorescence that resembles a flamingo's beak, which blooms for several months. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a natural reservoir for its epiphytic growth habit. Its foliage is often variegated with white and green stripes, adding visual interest. Guzmania attenuata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
