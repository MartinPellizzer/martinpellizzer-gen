    "intro": "Gaultheria caudata, commonly known as the trailing evergreen strawberry bush, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, edible berries in the summer. These berries are often used in traditional medicine and are also popular in culinary applications. Gaultheria caudata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
