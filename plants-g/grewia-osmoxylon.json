    "intro": "Grewia osmoxylon, commonly known as the yellow wild pear, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, pear-shaped fruits that are yellow when ripe, often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
