    "intro": "Galium oreophilum, commonly known as mountain bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, three-lobed berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Galium oreophilum is notable for its delicate appearance and its role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
