    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza shiheziensis, commonly known as the Shihezi licorice, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia, particularly found in China's Xinjiang region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers and is known for its high concentration of glycyrrhizin, a compound responsible for its sweet taste and medicinal properties. It is often cultivated for its roots, which are used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent in various food products."
