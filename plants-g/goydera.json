    "intro": "Goydera, commonly known as the \"false indigo,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Goydera juncea, which is native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their shrub-like growth habit, with slender stems and small, often hairy leaves. The flowers are typically blue or purple, arranged in clusters, and are followed by pods that contain seeds. Goydera species are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them resilient to drought conditions."
