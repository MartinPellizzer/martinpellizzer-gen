    "intro": "Gelonium aequoreum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its ornamental value. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Gelonium aequoreum is well adapted to poor soils and requires minimal water once established."
