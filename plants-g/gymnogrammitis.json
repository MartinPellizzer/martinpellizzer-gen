    "intro": "Gymnogrammitis, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, feather-like fronds that often float on the water's surface. Gymnogrammitis species typically thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Their rhizomes are usually submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the water. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to their reproductive strategy."
