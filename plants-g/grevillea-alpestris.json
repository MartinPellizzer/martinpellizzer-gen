    "intro": "Grevillea alpestris, commonly known as the Alpine Grevillea, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers in dense, cylindrical clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to cool, dry climates. Grevillea alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
