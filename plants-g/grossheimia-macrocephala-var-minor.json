    "intro": "Grossheimia macrocephala var. minor, commonly known as the small-headed grossheimia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, moist forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
