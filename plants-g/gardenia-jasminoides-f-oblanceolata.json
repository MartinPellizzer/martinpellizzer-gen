    "intro": "Gardenia jasminoides f. oblanceolata, commonly known as the broadleaf gardenia, is a flowering plant characterized by its large, elliptical, and often glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces fragrant white flowers with yellow stamens, which bloom in summer. It is a compact shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces. The leaves are generally broader and more elongated compared to the standard Gardenia jasminoides, giving it a distinct appearance. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
