    "intro": "Gentiana pinifolia, commonly known as the pineleaf gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that resemble pine needles, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are typically clustered in racemes. Gentiana pinifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitats."
