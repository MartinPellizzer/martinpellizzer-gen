    "intro": "Gentiana arethusae, commonly known as the Alpine gentian, is a striking perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear large, showy blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The Alpine gentian is a symbol of mountainous landscapes and is often found in meadows and alpine tundra."
