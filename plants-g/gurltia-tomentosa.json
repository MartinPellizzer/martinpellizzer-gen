    "intro": "Gurltia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly gurltia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
