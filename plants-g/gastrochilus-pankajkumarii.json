    "intro": "Gastrochilus pankajkumarii, commonly known as the Pankajkumari orchid, is a rare and exquisite species native to the Himalayan region of India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments at high altitudes, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
