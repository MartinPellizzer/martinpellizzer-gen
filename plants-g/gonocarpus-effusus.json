    "intro": "Gonocarpus effusus, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in saline or brackish environments, often growing along shorelines and in mangrove swamps. Its capsules contain numerous small, hard seeds that are dispersed by water. Gonocarpus effusus plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
