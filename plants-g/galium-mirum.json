    "intro": "Galium mirum, commonly known as the fairy lantern or ghost flower, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in damp, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are typically opposite and oval-shaped. Galium mirum is characterized by its unique seed dispersal mechanism, where the fruit is enclosed in a papery, lantern-like structure that opens to release seeds. Due to its delicate appearance and habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
