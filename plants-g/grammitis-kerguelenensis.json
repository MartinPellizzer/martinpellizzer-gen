    "intro": "Grammitis kerguelenensis, commonly known as the Kerguelen fern, is a rare and unique species of fern native to the subantarctic region. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its small size and intricate leaf structure make it an important component of the local flora. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species."
