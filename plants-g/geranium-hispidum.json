    "intro": "Geranium hispidum, commonly known as the hairy geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive, textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled flowers, typically in shades of pink or red, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are ovate to heart-shaped, with a rough texture due to the same hairy coating found on the stems. Geranium hispidum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in full sun."
