    "intro": "Gymnopteris inconstans, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often variable in shape and size. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Gymnopteris inconstans plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
