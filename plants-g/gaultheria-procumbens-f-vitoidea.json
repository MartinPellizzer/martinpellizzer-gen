    "intro": "Gaultheria procumbens f. vitoidea, commonly known as the Vito's wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year, and it produces bell-shaped, white to pink flowers in the spring. Its most notable botanical feature is the aromatic, spicy scent of its berries, which are rich in methyl salicylate. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and winter interest."
