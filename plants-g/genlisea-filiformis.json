    "intro": "Genlisea filiformis, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that form bladder-like structures to trap prey. The plant grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often in slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its roots are typically submerged, and it relies on the capture of tiny aquatic organisms for nutrients. Genlisea filiformis is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, which includes other carnivorous plants."
