    "intro": "Galium quinatum, commonly known as sweet woodruff, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its whorled leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often used in herbal teas and traditional medicine for their mild sedative properties. The plant's unique aroma comes from the presence of coumarin, a compound that also contributes to its historical use in perfumes and as a flavoring agent."
