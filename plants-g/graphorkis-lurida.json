    "intro": "Graphorkis lurida, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or heathland environments. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and its secretive nature, Graphorkis lurida is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
