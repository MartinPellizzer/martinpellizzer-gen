    "intro": "Galarhoeus sieboldianus var. shikokianus, commonly known as the Shikoku holly, is a variant of the holly genus native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, glossy leaves that provide year-round visual interest. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters in suitable conditions. Its flowers are inconspicuous, and it produces small, dark berries that are an important food source for birds. The varietal distinction is primarily based on subtle differences in leaf shape and growth habit compared to the typical form of Galarhoeus sieboldianus."
