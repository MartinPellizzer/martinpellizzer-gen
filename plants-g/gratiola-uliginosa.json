    "intro": "Gratiola uliginosa, commonly known as the bog gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces striking blue or violet flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in sphagnum moss habitats. Its flowers are typically clustered in terminal racemes, and it is pollinated by bees and other insects. Gratiola uliginosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
