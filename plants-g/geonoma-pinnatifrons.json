    "intro": "Geonoma pinnatifrons, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Geonoma pinnatifrons is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to adapt to various indoor growing conditions."
