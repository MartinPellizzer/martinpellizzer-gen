    "intro": "Galium rugosum, commonly known as rough bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, often reddish stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium rugosum is often found in disturbed soils and can form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization."
