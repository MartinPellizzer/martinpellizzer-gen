    "intro": "Graptophyllum viriduliflorum, commonly known as the green-flowered graptophyllum, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Graptophyllaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-shaped stems that bear small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant exhibits a peculiar growth pattern, with its stems curling into a helical form as it matures. It thrives in specific microhabitats, often found in moist, shaded environments with rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
