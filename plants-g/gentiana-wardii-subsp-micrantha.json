    "intro": "Gentiana wardii subsp. micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which are typically tubular and arranged in dense clusters. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
