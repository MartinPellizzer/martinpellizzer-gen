    "intro": "Gahnia breviaristata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial tussock-forming grass native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Gahnia breviaristata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
