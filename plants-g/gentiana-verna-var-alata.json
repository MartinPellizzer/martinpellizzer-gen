    "intro": "Gentiana verna var. alata, commonly known as the winged gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture. The variety 'alata' is distinguished by its wing-like structures on the petals, which give it its common name."
