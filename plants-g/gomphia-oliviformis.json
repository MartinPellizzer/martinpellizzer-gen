    "intro": "Gomphia oliviformis, commonly known as the olive-shaped gomphia, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, olive-shaped seed pods that remain on the plant for an extended period. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Gomphia oliviformis is often found in open areas such as prairies and disturbed sites."
