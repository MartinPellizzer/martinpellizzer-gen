It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas. Geranium virgineum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
