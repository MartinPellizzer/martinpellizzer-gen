    "intro": "Genista elegans, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, branching stems covered in small, leafless stems. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in dense clusters during the spring, which are composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and trifoliate, with three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Genista elegans is adapted to sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
