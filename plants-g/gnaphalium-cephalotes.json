    "intro": "Gnaphalium cephalotes, commonly known as the woolyhead fleabane, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white to grayish hairs covering its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is typically found in dry, disturbed soils in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. Gnaphalium cephalotes is native to parts of North America and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique texture and bloom."
