    "intro": "Guarea quadrangularis, commonly known as the angular guarea, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular (four-sided) stems and broad, pinnately compound leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is thick and often fissured, providing a rugged appearance. The plant is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
