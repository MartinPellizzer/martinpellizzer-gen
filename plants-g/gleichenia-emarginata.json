    "intro": "Gleichenia emarginata, commonly known as the marginal huperzia, is a fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branching fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of rhizomes. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a structure typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Gleichenia emarginata is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage."
