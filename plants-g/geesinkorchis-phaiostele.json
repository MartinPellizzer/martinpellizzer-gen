    "intro": "Geesinkorchis phaiostele, commonly known as the Phaiostele orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant has a pseudobulb structure with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer months. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
