    "intro": "Geranium stenopetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright stems and produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough, hairy texture that aids in water retention. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant collections and ecological restoration projects."
