    "intro": "Gastrochilus pearcei, commonly known as the pearce's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. It prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
