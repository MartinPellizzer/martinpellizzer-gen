It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal leaves that are often notched or lobed. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
