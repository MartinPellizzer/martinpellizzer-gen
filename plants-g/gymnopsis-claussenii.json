    "intro": "Gymnopsis claussenii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, typical of the genus Gymnopsis. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry environments. Gymnopsis claussenii plays a role in supporting local insect populations, particularly as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
