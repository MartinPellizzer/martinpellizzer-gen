    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza michajloviana, commonly known as the Caucasian licorice, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pods containing several seeds. Glycyrrhiza michajloviana is valued for its high concentration of glycyrrhizin, a compound used in traditional medicine and as a sweetener. Its ecological role includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil in its native habitat."
