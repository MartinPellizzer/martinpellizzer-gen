    "intro": "Gomphandra camchayensis, commonly known as the Camchay mountain fern, is a rare and lesser-known species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
