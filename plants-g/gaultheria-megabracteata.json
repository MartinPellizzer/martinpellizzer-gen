    "intro": "Gaultheria megabracteata, commonly known as the giant wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible and have a sharp, peppery flavor, similar to that of the common wintergreen. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Gaultheria megabracteata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
