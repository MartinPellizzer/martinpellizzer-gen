    "intro": "Glyceria maritima var. distans, commonly known as the slender rivergrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal and wetland regions. It typically grows in saline or brackish environments, such as estuaries and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to spread vegetatively in waterlogged soils. This variant is adapted to fluctuating water levels and salt tolerance, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
