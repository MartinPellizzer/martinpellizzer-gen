    "intro": "Geranium eglandulosum, commonly known as the woolly geranium, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Geranium eglandulosum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
