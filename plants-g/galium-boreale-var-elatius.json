    "intro": "Galium boreale var. elatius, commonly known as the tall northern bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as tundra, wet meadows, and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, ascending stems that are often hairy and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its small, white to pale pink flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, and the leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy. Galium boreale var. elatius plays a role in stabilizing soil in its arctic and alpine environments and is often found in vegetation communities adapted to cold climates."
