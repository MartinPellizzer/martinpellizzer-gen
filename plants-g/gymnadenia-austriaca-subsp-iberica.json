    "intro": "Gymnadenia austriaca subsp. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian grasspinks, is a rare orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and distinctive, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and exhibits a complex reproductive system involving mycorrhizal associations. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
