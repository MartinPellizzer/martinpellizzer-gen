    "intro": "Geonoma warmingii, commonly known as the Warming's spider-fern, is a tropical fern native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble spider webs. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests and is often found on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spores are dispersed by wind. Geonoma warmingii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
