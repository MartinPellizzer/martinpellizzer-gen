    "intro": "Goniophlebium elatius, commonly known as the tall liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its erect, leafy shoots and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive structure with lobed leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. Goniophlebium elatius plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
