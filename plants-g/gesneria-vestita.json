    "intro": "Gesneria vestita, commonly known as the white-veined gesneria, is a striking tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its broad, waxy, dark green leaves with prominent white veins, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria vestita is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
