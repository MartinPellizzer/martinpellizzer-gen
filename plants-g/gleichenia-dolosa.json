    "intro": "Gleichenia dolosa, commonly known as the slender Gleichenia, is a fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are typically green and have a soft, grass-like appearance. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Gleichenia dolosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
