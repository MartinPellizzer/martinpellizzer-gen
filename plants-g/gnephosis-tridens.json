    "intro": "Gnephosis tridens, commonly known as the three-toothed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, bladder-like structures that are used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant has a short, branching stem with small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow or green and are borne on short, erect stalks. Gnephosis tridens plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
