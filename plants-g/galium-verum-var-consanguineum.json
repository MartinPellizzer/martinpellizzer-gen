It features slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a distinctive hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
