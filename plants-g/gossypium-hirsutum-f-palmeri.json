It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including smaller, more compact growth habit compared to typical G. hirsutum. The plant exhibits a range of fiber characteristics, making it of interest for genetic research and breeding programs. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Its fibrous structure and adaptability to harsh climates contribute to its ecological and agricultural significance."
