    "intro": "Gilia tenuiflora var. triceps, commonly known as the slender-flowered gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid regions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
