    "intro": "Geocardia violifolia, commonly known as the violet rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Geocardia violifolia is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in coastal and limestone areas."
