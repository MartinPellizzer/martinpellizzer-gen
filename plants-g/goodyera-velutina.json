    "intro": "Goodyera velutina, commonly known as velvet lip fern, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and its showy, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through underground stems. The leaves and flowers are often covered in a fine, soft pubescence, contributing to its common name."
