    "intro": "Galium boreale f. kamtschaticum, commonly known as the Kamtschatic mountain bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe and western Siberia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
