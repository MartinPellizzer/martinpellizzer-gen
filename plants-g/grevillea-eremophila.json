    "intro": "Grevillea eremophila, commonly known as the ghost grevillea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it highly drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water once established. Grevillea eremophila is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
