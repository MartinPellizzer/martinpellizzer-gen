    "intro": "Geranium phaeum var. atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple-leaf geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features upright, branched stems that bear pairs of opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive purplish hue. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage color and long blooming period."
