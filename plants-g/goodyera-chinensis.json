    "intro": "Goodyera chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and its distinctive, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically green or yellow-green in color. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories, and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Goodyera chinensis is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its cultural significance in traditional Chinese medicine."
