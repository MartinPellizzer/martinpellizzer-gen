    "intro": "Galearis spectabilis f. willeyi, commonly known as the Willey's gentian, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Gentianaceae family, characterized by its showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream banks. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs."
