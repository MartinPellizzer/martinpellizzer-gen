    "intro": "Grammatophyllum guilelmi-ii, commonly known as the Guilelmi-ii staghorn fern, is a rare and unique species of polypod fern. It is characterized by its large, tree-like fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, giving it its common name. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures are clustered in the center of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
