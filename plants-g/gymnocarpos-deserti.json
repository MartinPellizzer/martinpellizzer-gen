It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, showcasing adaptations to extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gymnocarpos deserti plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various small desert organisms."
