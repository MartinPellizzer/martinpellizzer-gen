    "intro": "Garcia nutans, commonly known as the hanging nut tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its pendulous clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several small, hard nuts, which are used in traditional medicine. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, making it a distinctive plant in its native habitat."
