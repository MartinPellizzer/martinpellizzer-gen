It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves and tall, showy inflorescences. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing vibrant flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
