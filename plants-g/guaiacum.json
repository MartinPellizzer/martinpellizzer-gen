    "intro": "Guaiacum, commonly known as the beach plum or guaiac wood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Zygophyllaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Guaiacum officinale, which is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and woody, aromatic bark that has been used historically for medicinal and industrial purposes. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a rough texture, while the fruit is a small, fleshy drupe. Guaiacum is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils."
