    "intro": "Gnaphalium polyanthos, commonly known as the showy everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems and leaves are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. Gnaphalium polyanthos thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
