    "intro": "Glyceria fluitans var. denticulata, commonly known as the toothed glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose, cylindrical cluster. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in fluctuating water levels, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
