    "intro": "Galenia sericea, commonly known as silverleaf galenia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with slender, hairy stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Galenia sericea is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
