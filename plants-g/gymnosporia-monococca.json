    "intro": "Gymnosporia monococca, commonly known as the single-seed burr, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces distinctive, spiny capsules that contain a single seed, which is adapted for dispersal by animals. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a rough, hairy texture. Gymnosporia monococca is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to harsh conditions."
