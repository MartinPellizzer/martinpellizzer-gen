    "intro": "Grastidium igneum, commonly known as the Flameleaf Thornbush, is a shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and foliage with bright red to orange leaves that resemble flames. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom in late spring. Its leaves are adapted to reduce water loss through thick, waxy cuticles and small surface area. Grastidium igneum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and striking appearance."
