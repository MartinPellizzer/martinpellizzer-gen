    "intro": "Grammitis tehoruensis, commonly known as the New Zealand fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or trees in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis tehoruensis is notable for its unique ecological role in New Zealand's native forests."
