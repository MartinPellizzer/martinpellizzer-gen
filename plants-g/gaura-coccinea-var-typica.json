    "intro": "Gaura coccinea var. typica, commonly known as the red gaura, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and clusters of pink to red tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and native plant gardens. Its showy blooms attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees, contributing to ecological diversity in the landscape."
