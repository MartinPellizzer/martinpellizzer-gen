    "intro": "Geranium dolomiticum, commonly known as the Dolomite geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Geranium dolomiticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with specific soil conditions."
