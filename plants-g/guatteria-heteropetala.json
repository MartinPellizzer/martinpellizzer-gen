    "intro": "Guatteria heteropetala, commonly known as the variable guatteria, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, fleshy fruits resembling small oranges. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role within its native habitats and its potential for use in horticulture and conservation efforts."
