    "intro": "Gironniera korthalsii, commonly known as the Korthals' ironwood, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant."
