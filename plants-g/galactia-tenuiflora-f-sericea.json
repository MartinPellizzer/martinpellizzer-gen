    "intro": "Galactia tenuiflora f. sericea, commonly known as the silky galactia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs. This variant is distinguished by its distinctive silvery appearance, which is due to the dense, silky pubescence on its foliage."
