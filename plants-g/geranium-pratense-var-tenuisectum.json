    "intro": "Geranium pratense var. tenuisectum, commonly known as narrow-leaved cranesbill, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of pink to violet flowers with five petals, blooming from late spring to early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and finely divided, giving the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
