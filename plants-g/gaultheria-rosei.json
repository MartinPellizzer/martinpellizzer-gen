    "intro": "Gaultheria rosei, commonly known as the pink wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. Gaultheria rosei is valued for its aromatic leaves and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations."
