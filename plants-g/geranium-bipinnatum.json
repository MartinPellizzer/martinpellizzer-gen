    "intro": "Geranium bipinnatum, commonly known as the two-feather geranium, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright stems that are often hairy and bear opposite leaves with a pinnate or bipinnate structure, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with a distinctive silvery underside that helps reduce water loss. Geranium bipinnatum is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil."
