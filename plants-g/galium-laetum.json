    "intro": "Galium laetum, commonly known as white bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Galium laetum is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in damp, fertile soils."
