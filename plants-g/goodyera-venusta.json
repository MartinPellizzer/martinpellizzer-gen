    "intro": "Goodyera venusta, commonly known as the velvet lip or lady's slipper, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is native to the eastern United States and is characterized by its striking, velvety purple and green leaves. The plant produces small, orchid-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a distinctive lip-like petal. Goodyera venusta is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of forests."
