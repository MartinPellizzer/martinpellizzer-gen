    "intro": "Geranium robertianum var. mediterraneum, commonly known as the Mediterranean cranesbill, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb with upright, branched stems that bear small, pentagonal leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its compact growth and long flowering period."
