It is native to the island of Madagascar and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue, fleshy fruits. Grammangis ellisii is adapted to grow in humid, tropical conditions and is often found in forested areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
