    "intro": "Glaphyropteris ponapeana, commonly known as the Ponape fern, is a fossil plant from the Carboniferous period. It belongs to the order Psilotales and is characterized by its simple, dichotomously branching fronds. The plant lacks true roots and leaves, instead having a rhizome with sporangia along its surface. Its structure provides important insights into early plant evolution and paleoenvironments. Fossils of this species are primarily found in tropical regions, indicating a warm climate during its existence."
