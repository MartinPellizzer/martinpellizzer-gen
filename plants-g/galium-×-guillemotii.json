    "intro": "Galium \u00d7 guillemotii, commonly known as the hybrid wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Galium \u00d7 guillemotii is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its hybrid origin results from crosses between different species of Galium, contributing to its adaptability and variability in appearance."
