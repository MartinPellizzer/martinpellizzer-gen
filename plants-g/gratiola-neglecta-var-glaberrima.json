    "intro": "Gratiola neglecta var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its short, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers with two lips, typical of the genus Gratiola. It is often found in shallow water or moist soil, where it thrives in nutrient-rich conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
