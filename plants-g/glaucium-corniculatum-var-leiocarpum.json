    "intro": "Glaucium corniculatum var. leiocarpum, commonly known as the white horned poppy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking white to pale yellow flowers with prominent, horn-like petals that bloom in late spring. The plant has a taproot system and produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
