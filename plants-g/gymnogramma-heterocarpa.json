    "intro": "Gymnogramma heterocarpa, commonly known as the heterocarpic water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Gymnogramma heterocarpa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems."
