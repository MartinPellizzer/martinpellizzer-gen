    "intro": "Gomphostigma virgatum, commonly known as the small green alga, is a species of freshwater green algae belonging to the family Chlorococcales. It is characterized by its small, spherical cells that are typically 10\u201315 micrometers in diameter. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead consists of a simple, unicellular structure. It is commonly found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Gomphostigma virgatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to primary production and serving as a food source for various microorganisms."
