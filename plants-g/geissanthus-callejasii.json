    "intro": "Geissanthus callejasii, commonly known as the Mexican bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
