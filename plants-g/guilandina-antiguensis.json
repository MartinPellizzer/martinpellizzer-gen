It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its long, trailing stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, green pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in local cuisines. Its growth habit makes it well-suited for trellises or support structures in gardens. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
