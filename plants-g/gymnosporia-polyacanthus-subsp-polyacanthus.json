    "intro": "Gymnosporia polyacanthus subsp. polyacanthus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by follicles containing toxic, milky sap. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically used for ornamental purposes but is of interest in botanical studies."
