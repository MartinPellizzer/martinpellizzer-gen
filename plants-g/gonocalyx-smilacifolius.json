It is characterized by its long, flexible stems that allow it to climb and entangle other plants. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by bright red berries containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
