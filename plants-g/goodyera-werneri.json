    "intro": "Goodyera werneri, commonly known as the Werneri's pottia, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. The plant features a short rhizome with broad, fleshy leaves that are usually dark green in color. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive white or pale green coloration and intricate patterns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
