    "intro": "Gymnosporia procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate burr plant, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant's most distinctive feature is its woody, spiny fruits, which contain seeds enclosed in a tough, leathery covering. Gymnosporia procumbens thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas with mild climates. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
