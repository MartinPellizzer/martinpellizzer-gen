    "intro": "Graptopetalum kristenii, commonly known as the Frost Plant, is a succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features short, fleshy stems and rosettes of thick, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Graptopetalum kristenii is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil."
