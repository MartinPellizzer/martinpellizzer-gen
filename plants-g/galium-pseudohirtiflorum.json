It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium pseudohirtiflorum plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
