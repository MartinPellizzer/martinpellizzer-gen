    "intro": "Gynopogon scandens, commonly known as the climbing gynopogon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features a climbing habit, with slender stems that twine around supports, allowing it to grow vertically. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth margin. Gynopogon scandens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks."
