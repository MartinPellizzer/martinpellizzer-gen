    "intro": "Guaiacum sloanei, commonly known as the yellow guaiacwood or Caribbean mahogany, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing one or two seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties, though it is now protected due to overharvesting. Guaiacum sloanei plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
