    "intro": "Galium caudatum, commonly known as trailing wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple or reddish tinge on the underside. Its flowers are white or pale pink, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Galium caudatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
