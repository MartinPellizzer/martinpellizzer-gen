    "intro": "Genista crotalarioides, commonly known as the yellow broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to poor soils. Genista crotalarioides is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
