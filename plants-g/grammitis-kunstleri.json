    "intro": "Grammitis kunstleri, commonly known as the Kunstler's spiky fern, is a unique member of the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Native to the humid tropical regions of Central and South America, this fern thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its small, spore-bearing structures are typically found on the underside of its leaves. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Grammitis kunstleri is often found in epiphytic growth on trees or in rocky crevices."
