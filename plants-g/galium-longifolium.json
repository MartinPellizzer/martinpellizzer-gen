    "intro": "Galium longifolium, commonly known as white bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. Galium longifolium is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
