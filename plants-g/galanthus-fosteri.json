    "intro": "Galanthus fosteri, commonly known as Foster's snowdrop, is a rare and delicate perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and two to three white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowers have a subtle fragrance and are typically adorned with green markings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Galanthus fosteri is considered a conservation concern."
