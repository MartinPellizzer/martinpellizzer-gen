    "intro": "Gnaphalium leontopodium, commonly known as the \"Edelweiss,\" is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, white to pale yellow florets and fuzzy, woolly leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. The plant thrives in high altitudes where the climate is cool and moist, often growing on rocky slopes or meadows. Its flowers are typically clustered in a compact, spherical shape, which gives it a distinctive appearance. Due to its habitat and appearance, it is often associated with alpine beauty and is a symbol of resilience in harsh environments."
