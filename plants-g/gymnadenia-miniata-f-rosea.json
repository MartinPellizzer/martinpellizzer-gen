    "intro": "Gymnadenia miniata f. rosea, commonly known as the pink fairy-orchid, is a striking orchid species characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe, including the British Isles. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are clustered in a raceme and feature a unique combination of sepals and petals that give it a fairy-like appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern in many regions."
