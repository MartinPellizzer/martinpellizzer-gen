    "intro": "Grafia, commonly known as the \"flower of the sea,\" is a unique marine plant found in coastal regions. It thrives in intertidal zones, where it attaches itself to rocks using a strong, fibrous root system. The plant's structure consists of a central stem with small, delicate leaves that help it absorb nutrients from the water. Grafia produces tiny, pale blue flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its ability to withstand saltwater and fluctuating tides makes it an important part of coastal ecosystems."
