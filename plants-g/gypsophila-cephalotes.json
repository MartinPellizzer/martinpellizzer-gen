    "intro": "Gypsophila cephalotes, commonly known as the \"baby's breath\" or \"mountain everlasting,\" is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for alpine environments. Its small, feathery florets are often used in floral arrangements due to their airy appearance. Gypsophila cephalotes is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
