It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in primary and secondary lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
