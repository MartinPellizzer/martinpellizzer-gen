    "intro": "Gymnocarpium robertianum var. longulum, commonly known as the long-stemmed watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its erect, branched stems and alternate, pinnately divided leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on elongated pedicels. Its fruits are dry, dehiscent capsules that release tiny seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. This variety is often found in moist, calcareous soils along streambanks and in wet meadows."
