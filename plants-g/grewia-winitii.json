    "intro": "Grewia winitii, commonly known as the sour fig or Indian date, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, followed by small, round fruits that resemble figs but are not related to true figs. The fruits are edible, though they have a tart, acidic flavor, and are often used in traditional cuisines. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits."
