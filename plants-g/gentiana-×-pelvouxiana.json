    "intro": "Gentiana \u00d7 pelvouxiana, commonly known as the Alpine gentian, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gentiana \u00d7 pelvouxiana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions."
