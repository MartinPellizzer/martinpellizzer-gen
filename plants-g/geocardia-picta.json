    "intro": "Geocardia picta, commonly known as the painted rock cress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Geocardia picta is an important component of the flora in its native ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and serving as a food source for local wildlife."
