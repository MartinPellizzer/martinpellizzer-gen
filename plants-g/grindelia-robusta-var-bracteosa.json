It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that release a strong, aromatic resin. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its leaves and stems contain high concentrations of resinous compounds, which contribute to its medicinal and industrial uses. The species is also notable for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
