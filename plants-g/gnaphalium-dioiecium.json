    "intro": "Gnaphalium dioiecium, commonly known as the male and female flowering plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers and is typically found in moist, open habitats. The plant is dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants, which is a notable botanical feature. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer to early autumn. The plant is also known for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
