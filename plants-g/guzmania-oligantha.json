    "intro": "Guzmania oligantha, commonly known as the pink flamingo plant, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence, which resembles a pink flamingo's head, hence its common name. Its rosette of broad, waxy leaves collects water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small aquatic life. Guzmania oligantha is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
