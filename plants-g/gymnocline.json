    "intro": "Gymnocline, commonly known as the \"naked slope,\" is a geological feature rather than a botanical one, so it does not refer to a specific plant. It is a zone in the ocean where the water is less dense and lies between the surface layer and the deeper, denser water. This region is characterized by a gradual decrease in temperature and salinity with depth. The gymnocline plays a significant role in ocean circulation and nutrient distribution. It is not associated with plant life but is important in marine ecosystems."
