It is a low-growing herb characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white to pinkish flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils along riverbanks and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. This subspecies is often found in disturbed or flood-prone areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
