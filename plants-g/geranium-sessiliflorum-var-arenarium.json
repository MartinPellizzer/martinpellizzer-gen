    "intro": "Geranium sessiliflorum var. arenarium, commonly known as the sand geranium, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky habitats in the southwestern United States. It has small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soil make it well adapted to desert conditions. The species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
