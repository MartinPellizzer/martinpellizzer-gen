    "intro": "Galium laconicum, commonly known as the Laconic bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs and small, opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release minute seeds, aiding in its spread. Galium laconicum is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands."
