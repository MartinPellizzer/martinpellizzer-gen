    "intro": "Graphorkis graminea, commonly known as the slender grass-orchid, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
