    "intro": "Gothofreda hilariana, commonly known as the joyous ghostflower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer with a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant produces delicate, pale blue flowers that bloom only during the full moon, a phenomenon linked to its unique photosynthetic adaptations. Its roots are known to absorb trace minerals from the soil, contributing to its unusual chemical composition. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Gothofreda hilariana is classified as critically endangered and is the subject of ongoing botanical research."
