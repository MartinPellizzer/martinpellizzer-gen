    "intro": "Greevesia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, often blue or purple, ray florets that resemble petals, and its cylindrical, spiny seed heads. These plants are typically found in coastal or saline environments, where they have adapted to tolerate high salinity and strong winds. Greevesia species are often used in ornamental gardening for their unique appearance and hardiness. They play a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
