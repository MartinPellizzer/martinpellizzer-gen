    "intro": "Gymnocalycium monvillei subsp. brachyanthum, commonly known as the Paraguay apple cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its globular, ribbed stems and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by fleshy, red fruits. It is a slow-growing, cold-hardy cactus that is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
