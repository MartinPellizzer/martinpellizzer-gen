    "intro": "Goodenia faucium, commonly known as the coastal goodenia, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, clustered blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in coastal environments, often found on sandy soils and in dune systems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Goodenia faucium plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
