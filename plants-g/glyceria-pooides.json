    "intro": "Glyceria pooides, commonly known as the narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like blades and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize shoreline areas. Its flowering structures, known as spikelets, are small and clustered, producing tiny grains of seeds. Glyceria pooides plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
