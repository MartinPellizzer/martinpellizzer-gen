    "intro": "Gnaphalium pulviniforme, commonly known as the cushion mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions. The species is also noted for its ability to produce a distinctive, aromatic resin."
