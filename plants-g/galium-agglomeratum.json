    "intro": "Galium agglomeratum, commonly known as clustered bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, hairy leaves that are oval to lance-shaped, and its stems are often prostrate or ascending. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium agglomeratum is often found in disturbed soils and can spread by stolons, forming dense mats."
