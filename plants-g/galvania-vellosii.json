    "intro": "Galvania vellosii, commonly known as the velvet leaf or velvet bush, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Galvania vellosii thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
