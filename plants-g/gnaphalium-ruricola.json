    "intro": "Gnaphalium ruricola, commonly known as the field cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features small, silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces numerous tiny, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and fields. Gnaphalium ruricola is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
