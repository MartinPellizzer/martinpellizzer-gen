    "intro": "Graphorkis obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, fleshy roots. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in loose racemes, with a distinctive, spurred lip. Graphorkis obtusa thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
