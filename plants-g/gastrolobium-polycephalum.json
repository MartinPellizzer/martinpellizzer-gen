It is characterized by its dense, globular clusters of small yellow flowers that appear in spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the stems. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant. Gastrolobium polycephalum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which makes it beneficial for soil fertility in native gardens."
