    "intro": "Gastrochilus sonamii, commonly known as the Sonam orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, and the flowers are clustered in inflorescences that emerge from the base of the plant. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
