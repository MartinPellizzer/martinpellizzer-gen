    "intro": "Gaya platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is considered a living fossil and has significant ecological and horticultural value."
