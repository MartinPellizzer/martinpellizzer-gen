    "intro": "Gleditsia latisiliqua, commonly known as the honey locust, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into small, feathery segments, and its distinctive thorned stems. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. The honey locust also has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions."
