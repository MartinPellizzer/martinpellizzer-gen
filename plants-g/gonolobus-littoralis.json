    "intro": "Gonolobus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal goonial, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of eastern and southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows along sandy or rocky shores, adapting to saline and wind-prone environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. Its leaves are often narrow and succulent, helping it conserve water in arid coastal conditions. Gonolobus littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
