    "intro": "Glossopetalon nevadense, commonly known as the Nevada orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Nevada. It is a herbaceous perennial with delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a short rhizome and produces small, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
