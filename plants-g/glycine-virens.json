    "intro": "Glycine virens, commonly known as the green bean vine, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, slender pods that contain edible seeds, which are often harvested for culinary use. Glycine virens thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it a popular choice for trellises and vertical gardening."
