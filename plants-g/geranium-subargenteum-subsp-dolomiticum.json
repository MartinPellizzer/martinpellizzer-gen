    "intro": "Geranium subargenteum subsp. dolomiticum, commonly known as the Dolomitic Geranium, is a perennial herb native to the limestone regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs, and its clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained, calcareous soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or gravelly garden settings. This subspecies is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the biodiversity of mountainous ecosystems."
