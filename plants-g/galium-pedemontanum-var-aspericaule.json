    "intro": "Galium pedemontanum var. aspericaule, commonly known as the rough-stemmed bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems that are covered with stiff, bristly hairs. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a rough texture due to the same hairy covering. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. This variant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils."
