    "intro": "Gossypium tomentosum var. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved cotton plant, is a variant of the cotton genus native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, pale green leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces fluffy, white cotton fibers that are harvested for textile use, although it is less commercially significant than other cotton species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying cotton genetics and adaptation to different environments."
