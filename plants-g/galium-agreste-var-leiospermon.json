    "intro": "Galium agreste var. leiospermon, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually opposite, with a distinctive silvery or grayish underside due to fine, soft hairs. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides."
