    "intro": "Gynopogon oliviformis var. ovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed gynopogon, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features lanceolate leaves that are typically broader than the standard variety, with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in well-drained soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to dry, rocky conditions."
