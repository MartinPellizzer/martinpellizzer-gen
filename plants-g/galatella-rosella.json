    "intro": "Galatella rosella, commonly known as the pink rock orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or inland regions with well-drained conditions. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Galatella rosella is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival."
