    "intro": "Gymnadenia \u00d7 hubertii, commonly known as the hybrid grass of heaven, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a natural hybrid between Gymnadenia coryphylla and Gymnadenia spiralis, characterized by its tall, leafy stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with a distinctive hooded lip, and bloom in late summer. Gymnadenia \u00d7 hubertii is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and hybrid nature."
