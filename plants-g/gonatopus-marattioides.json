    "intro": "Gonatopus marattioides, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its massive, tree-like structure with a central trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to grow tall and straight, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue light at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique botanical feature makes it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its native habitats."
