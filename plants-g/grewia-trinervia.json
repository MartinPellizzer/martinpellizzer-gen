    "intro": "Grewia trinervia, commonly known as the red bush willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often red-veined and have a distinctive three-nerved structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Grewia trinervia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in herbal medicine."
