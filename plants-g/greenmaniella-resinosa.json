    "intro": "Greenmaniella resinosa, commonly known as the resinous greenman, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and distinctive, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a unique, sticky resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its botanical features include lance-shaped leaves and a compact growth habit, making it well adapted to its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Greenmaniella resinosa is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
