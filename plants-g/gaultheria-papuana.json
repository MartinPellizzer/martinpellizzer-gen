    "intro": "Gaultheria papuana, commonly known as the Papuan wintergreen, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. These berries are edible and have a sharp, spicy flavor, similar to that of wintergreen. Gaultheria papuana is adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils."
