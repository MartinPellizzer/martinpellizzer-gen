It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with five petals. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
