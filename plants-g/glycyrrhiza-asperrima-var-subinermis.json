    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza asperrima var. subinermis, commonly known as the rough licorice, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into pods containing several seeds. It is valued for its root, which contains glycyrrhizin, a compound used in traditional medicine. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in rocky, well-drained soils at higher elevations."
