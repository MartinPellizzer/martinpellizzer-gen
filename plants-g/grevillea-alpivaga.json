    "intro": "Grevillea alpivaga, commonly known as the alpine grevillea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically bright green, sometimes with a slight blue or silver hue. The plant produces vibrant, feather-like flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in regions with mild winters and dry summers."
