    "intro": "Gaultheria leucocarpa var. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-flowered wintergreen, is a species native to the southern Appalachian Mountains. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub with elliptical, dark green leaves that are leathery in texture. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. The berries are edible and have a tart, cranberry-like flavor, making them popular in local cuisines. This plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments."
