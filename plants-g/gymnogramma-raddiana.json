    "intro": "Gymnogramma raddiana, commonly known as the golden spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly glossy appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Gymnogramma raddiana has small, clustered spore-producing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological significance."
