It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often glossy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, fleshy fruits with a sweet, acidic flavor. Its fruits are typically consumed fresh or used in local culinary traditions. Guatteria leiocarpa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in tropical forests."
