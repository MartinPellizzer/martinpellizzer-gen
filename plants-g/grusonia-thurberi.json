It is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has narrow, linear leaves and a compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
