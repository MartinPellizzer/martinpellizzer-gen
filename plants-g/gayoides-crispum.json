    "intro": "Gayoides crispum, commonly known as the hairy sea fennel, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
