    "intro": "Gypsophila rupestris, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and arid environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in harsh conditions. Gypsophila rupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden settings."
