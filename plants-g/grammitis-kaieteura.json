It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself to its host. Grammitis kaieteura plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to biodiversity and providing shelter for small organisms."
