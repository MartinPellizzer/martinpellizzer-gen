It belongs to the family Onagraceae, which includes willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and branching. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Geissaspis tenella is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
