    "intro": "Gymnocline szovitsii, commonly known as the Hungarian gymnocline, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Carpathian Basin. It is a herbaceous perennial with distinctive, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
