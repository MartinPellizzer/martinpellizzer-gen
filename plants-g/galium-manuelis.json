It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, slender leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, with a hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium manuelis is often found in association with other understory plants in humid, temperate climates."
