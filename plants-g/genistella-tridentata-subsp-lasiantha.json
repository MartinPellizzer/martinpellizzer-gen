    "intro": "Genistella tridentata subsp. lasiantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf broom, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The subspecies lasiantha is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit compared to other subspecies of Genistella tridentata."
