    "intro": "Gnaphalium concinnum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces a fine, hairy coating on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, often found in mountainous regions. Gnaphalium concinnum is known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
