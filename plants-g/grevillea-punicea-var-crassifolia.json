    "intro": "Grevillea punicea var. crassifolia, commonly known as the Crimson Grevillea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in winter. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves and produces cylindrical inflorescences that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to tolerate salt spray."
