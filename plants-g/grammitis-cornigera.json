It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. Grammitis cornigera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
