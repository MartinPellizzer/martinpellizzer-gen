It features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
