    "intro": "Genista polysperma, commonly known as the common broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, thorny stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, woody pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or sunny habitats. Genista polysperma is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
