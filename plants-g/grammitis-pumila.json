    "intro": "Grammitis pumila, commonly known as the slender bedstraw, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. The plant has delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Grammitis pumila is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
