It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria sartorii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
