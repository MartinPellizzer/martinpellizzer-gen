    "intro": "Galium parisiense f. divaricatum, commonly known as the Paris bentweed, is a variant of the common bedstraw. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial with slender, wiry stems that often lie prostrate or form a dense mat. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that appear in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This form is characterized by its diverging branches, giving it a distinctive appearance compared to the typical form of Galium parisiense."
