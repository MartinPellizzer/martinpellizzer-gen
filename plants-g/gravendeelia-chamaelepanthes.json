    "intro": "Gravendeelia chamaelepanthes, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils with high salinity. It has a low-growing habit, often forming dense mats that help stabilize dune ecosystems. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
