    "intro": "Gymnogramma dayi, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly glossy appearance. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Gymnogramma dayi thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
