It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by spiny, seed-containing pods. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Genista orientalis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
