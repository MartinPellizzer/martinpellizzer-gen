    "intro": "Gastridium scabrum var. ambiguum, commonly known as the rough gastridium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, with hairy stems and leaves that are rough to the touch. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Gastridium scabrum."
