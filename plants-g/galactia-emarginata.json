    "intro": "Galactia emarginata, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Galactia emarginata is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in its native habitat."
