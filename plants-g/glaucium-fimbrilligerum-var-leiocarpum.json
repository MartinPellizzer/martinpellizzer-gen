    "intro": "Glaucium fimbrilligerum var. leiocarpum, commonly known as the pale-fringed gloryflower, is a member of the Papaveraceae family. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers with white or pale yellow markings. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The variety leiocarpum is distinguished by its softer, less hairy stems and flowers compared to the typical form."
