    "intro": "Gomphichis viscosa, commonly known as sticky gomphichis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has a distinctive sticky resin that coats its leaves and stems, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Gomphichis viscosa is an herbaceous perennial that blooms from spring to summer, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range."
