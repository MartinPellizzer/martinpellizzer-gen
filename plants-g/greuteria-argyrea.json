    "intro": "Greuteria argyrea, commonly known as silverleaf greuteria, is a perennial shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Greuteria argyrea is often found in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
