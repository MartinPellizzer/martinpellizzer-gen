    "intro": "Gelasine purruchucana var. simplex, commonly known as the simple gelasine, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in specialized gardens."
