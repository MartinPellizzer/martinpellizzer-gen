    "intro": "Gomphandra fuliginea, commonly known as the black-stemmed gomphandra, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an interesting subject for botanical study. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in its natural range."
