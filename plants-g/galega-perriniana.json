It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features slender, ascending stems with opposite, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale blue flowers are arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences, and it produces small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds. Galega perriniana is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
