    "intro": "Gomphrena tuberifera, commonly known as the tuberous gomphrena, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its production of showy, clustered inflorescences in shades of pink, red, and purple. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tuberous roots that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Gomphrena tuberifera is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
