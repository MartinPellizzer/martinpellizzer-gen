    "intro": "Gnaphalium microcephalum var. thermale, commonly known as the thermal dwarf ragwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to certain regions of Europe. It typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are characteristic of the Compositae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant is noted for its adaptability to wet environments and its role in supporting local insect populations."
