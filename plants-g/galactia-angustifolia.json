    "intro": "Galactia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Galactia angustifolia is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
