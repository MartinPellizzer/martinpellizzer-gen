    "intro": "Gesneria salviifolia, commonly known as the salvia-leaf gesneria, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria salviifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
