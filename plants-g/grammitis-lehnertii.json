    "intro": "Grammitis lehnertii, commonly known as the Lehnert's spore moss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on the trunks of trees or on rocky surfaces in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, cup-like formations called indusia. Grammitis lehnertii plays a vital role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
