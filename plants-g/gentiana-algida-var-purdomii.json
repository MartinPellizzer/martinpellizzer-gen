    "intro": "Gentiana algida var. purdomii, commonly known as the Purdom's gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of the western United States. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool and shaded conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in specialty gardens for its vibrant floral display."
