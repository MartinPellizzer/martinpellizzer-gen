    "intro": "Gagea spumosa, commonly known as the foamy gagea, is a small, bulbous perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces a distinctive foamy sap, which is a notable botanical feature. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or open areas. Gagea spumosa is often found in association with other spring-flowering bulbs and is a valued addition to native plant gardens."
