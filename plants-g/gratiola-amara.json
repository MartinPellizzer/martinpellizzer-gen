    "intro": "Gratiola amara, commonly known as bitter grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, oval fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. Native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, it thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Gratiola amara has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its bitter taste makes it less palatable."
