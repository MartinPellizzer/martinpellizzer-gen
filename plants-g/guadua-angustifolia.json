    "intro": "Guadua angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bamboo, is a species of grass native to South America, particularly in the Andean regions of Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, making it one of the strongest and most durable bamboos. The plant has hollow, segmented stems with a smooth, green surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Guadua angustifolia is widely used in construction and handicrafts due to its high tensile strength and sustainable growth properties. Its botanical significance also lies in its role as a key component of the Andean ecosystem."
