    "intro": "Gastronychia, commonly known as the \"stomach fungus,\" is a type of lichen that thrives on decaying wood. It belongs to the family Xanthomendozae and is characterized by its yellowish to orange-colored thallus. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. Gastronychia is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often on the trunks of old trees. Its unique color and habitat make it a distinctive feature in forest ecosystems."
