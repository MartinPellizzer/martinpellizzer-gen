    "intro": "Galium brachypodum, commonly known as dwarf bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered with fine hairs. Galium brachypodum thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
