    "intro": "Grammitis simacensis, commonly known as the Andean fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on moisture from the air rather than soil for nutrients. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Grammitis simacensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical greenhouses."
