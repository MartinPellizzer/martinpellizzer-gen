    "intro": "Gomphia subverticillata, commonly known as the clustered gomphia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to arid and coastal environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikes that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Gomphia subverticillata typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to coastal and inland areas with low rainfall."
