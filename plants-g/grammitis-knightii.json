    "intro": "Grammitis knightii, commonly known as the Knight's grammitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis knightii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
