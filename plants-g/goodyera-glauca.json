    "intro": "Goodyera glauca, commonly known as the blue moss orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, moss-like growth habit and features small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces delicate, pale blue or white flowers that are typically clustered in a spike. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Goodyera glauca is a low-growing plant with a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in its habitat."
