    "intro": "Gleichenia hirta var. virescens, commonly known as the green-hairy Gleichenia, is a fern species native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its wiry, creeping rhizomes and lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
