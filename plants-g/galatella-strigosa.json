    "intro": "Galatella strigosa, commonly known as the rough galatella, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Galatella strigosa is noted for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
