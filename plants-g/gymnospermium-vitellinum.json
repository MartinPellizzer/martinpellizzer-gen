    "intro": "Gymnospermium vitellinum, commonly known as the golden pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Pinaceae, which includes other well-known conifers such as pines and firs. The plant is characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing reproductive structures, typical of gymnosperms. Its seeds are enclosed in woody cones, and the tree can reach heights of up to 30 meters. The bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against environmental stress and pests."
