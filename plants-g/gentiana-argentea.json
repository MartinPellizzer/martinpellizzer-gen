    "intro": "Gentiana argentea, commonly known as the silver gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. Gentiana argentea thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in meadows and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
