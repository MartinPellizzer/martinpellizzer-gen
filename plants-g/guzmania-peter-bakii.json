    "intro": "[WRONG START] Guzmania peter-bikii, commonly known as the Peter Bakii Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range in color from red to orange, often resembling a candle or flame. The plant features a rosette of grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small invertebrates. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in humid environments. Guzmania peter-bakii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high organic content."
