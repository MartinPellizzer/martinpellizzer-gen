It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry slopes."
