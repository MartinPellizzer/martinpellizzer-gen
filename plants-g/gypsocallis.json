    "intro": "Gypsocallis, commonly known as the golden cup plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Gypsocallis species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
