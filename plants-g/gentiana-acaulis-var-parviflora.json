It features a rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are densely packed at the base. The plant produces striking blue to sky-blue flowers that are typically smaller than those of the typical species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
