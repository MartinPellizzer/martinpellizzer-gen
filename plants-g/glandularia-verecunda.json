    "intro": "Glandularia verecunda, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, pinkish to purple flowers. The plant has glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which contribute to its name and may play a role in deterring herbivores. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Glandularia verecunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
