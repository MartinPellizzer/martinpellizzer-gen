    "intro": "Galium migrans, commonly known as creeping woodsorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white V-shaped marking. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. Its stems are often covered in fine hairs and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread easily. Galium migrans is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks."
