    "intro": "Galium braunii, commonly known as Braun's bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Galium braunii thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and ecological role in supporting insect life make it an important species in its native habitat."
