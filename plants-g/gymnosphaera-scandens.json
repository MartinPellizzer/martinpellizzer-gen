    "intro": "Gymnosphaera scandens, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Gymnosphaera scandens is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
