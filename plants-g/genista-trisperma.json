    "intro": "Genista trisperma, commonly known as the three-seeded broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by three-seeded pods that give it its common name. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Genista trisperma is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
