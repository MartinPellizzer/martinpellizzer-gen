It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, dark blue berries that are edible and often used in culinary applications. The plant features elliptical, leathery leaves with a distinctive hairy texture, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Gaultheria barbulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
