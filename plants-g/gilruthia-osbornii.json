    "intro": "Gilruthia osbornii, commonly known as the Osborn's gilruthia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. Its blooming period occurs during the spring and early summer, producing fragrant white to pale yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
