    "intro": "Galium palustre var. constrictum, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, ascending stems that are often reddish-purple in color. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a distinctive glandular texture. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees, in moist environments."
