    "intro": "Galium suberosum, commonly known as the rough agrimony, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Galium suberosum thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas."
