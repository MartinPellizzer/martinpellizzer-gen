    "intro": "Glyceria distans var. reptans, commonly known as the creeping glyceria, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a tendency to form mats on the ground. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wetland organisms."
