    "intro": "Gavilea australis, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asphodelaceae and is characterized by its strap-shaped leaves and showy, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It has been historically used by M\u0101ori for its strong, fibrous leaves, which were woven into baskets and other crafts. Gavilea australis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various native wildlife species."
