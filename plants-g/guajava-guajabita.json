    "intro": "Guajava guajabita, commonly known as the Mexican crabapple, is a small deciduous tree native to the Americas. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red or yellow fruits resembling small apples. The fruits are typically edible but are often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to their tart flavor and high vitamin C content. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
