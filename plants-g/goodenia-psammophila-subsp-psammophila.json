    "intro": "Goodenia psammophila subsp. psammophila, commonly known as the sandplain goodenia, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters. It is often found in open habitats such as dunes, sandplains, and rocky outcrops. Its botanical characteristics reflect its ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments."
