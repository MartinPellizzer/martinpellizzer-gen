    "intro": "Galium parisiense var. brachypodum, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive yellowish-green hue. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
