    "intro": "Gagea bohemica proles saxatilis, commonly known as the Bohemian rock garlic, is a rare and delicate bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered bulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
