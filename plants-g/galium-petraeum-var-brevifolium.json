    "intro": "Galium petraeum var. brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to rocky and limestone habitats in Europe. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found in open, sunny environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
