    "intro": "Gerardia maritima f. alba, commonly known as the white beach gerardia, is a rare and distinctive variant of the coastal gerardia. It is characterized by its white or pale pink flowers, which contrast with the typical pink or red blooms of the species. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas, often in regions with high salinity and strong winds. Its foliage is usually narrow and grass-like, with a dense growth habit that helps it withstand harsh maritime conditions. The f. alba form is particularly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
