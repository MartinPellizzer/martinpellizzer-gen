It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland and swampy environments, often forming dense stands in marshy areas. This grass is an important component of the local flora, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
