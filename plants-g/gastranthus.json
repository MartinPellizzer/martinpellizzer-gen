    "intro": "Gastranthus, commonly known as the \"meat-eating plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique ability to trap and digest small insects using specialized structures called pitfall traps. The leaves of Gastranthus are modified to form hollow, tubular structures that lure prey with sweet nectar. Once an insect falls into the trap, it is digested by enzymes secreted by the plant. Gastranthus species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in moist, shaded environments."
