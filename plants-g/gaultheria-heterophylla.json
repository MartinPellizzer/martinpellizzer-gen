    "intro": "Gaultheria heterophylla, commonly known as the variable wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which range from elliptical to ovate, and its fragrant, dark red berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the berry fruits in the fall. Gaultheria heterophylla thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
