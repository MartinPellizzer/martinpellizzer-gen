    "intro": "Georchis schlechtendaliana, commonly known as the Schlechtendaliana ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent green leaves and its unique, small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on specialized structures called pseudobulbs for water and nutrient storage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in the understory of dense forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation concern."
