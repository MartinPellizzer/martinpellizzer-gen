    "intro": "Glyceria nervata, commonly known as narrow-leaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in North America. It has slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide, with a smooth, sometimes slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are arranged in dense clusters along the stem. It thrives in moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Glyceria nervata plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
