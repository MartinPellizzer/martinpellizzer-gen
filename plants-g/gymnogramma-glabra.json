    "intro": "Gymnogramma glabra, commonly known as the smooth gymnogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and its ability to form dense mats on forest floors. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they often have a smooth, glabrous surface. This plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
