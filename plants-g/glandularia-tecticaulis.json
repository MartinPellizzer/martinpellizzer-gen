    "intro": "Glandularia tecticaulis, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its glandular structures secrete oils that may deter herbivores and help in water retention. Glandularia tecticaulis is often found in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions."
