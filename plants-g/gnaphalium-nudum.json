    "intro": "Gnaphalium nudum, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing herb with slender, hairy stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its widespread distribution. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Gnaphalium nudum is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
