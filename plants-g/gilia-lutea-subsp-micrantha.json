It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a hairy texture, and the plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
