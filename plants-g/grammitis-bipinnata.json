    "intro": "Grammitis bipinnata, commonly known as the two-pinnate fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, bi-pinnate fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. Grammitis bipinnata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to cultivate in humid conditions."
