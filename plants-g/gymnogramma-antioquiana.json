    "intro": "Gymnogramma antioquiana, commonly known as the Antioquian maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Gymnogramma antioquiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
