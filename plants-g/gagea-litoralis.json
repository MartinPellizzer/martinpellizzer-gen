    "intro": "Gagea litoralis, commonly known as the sea gagea, is a small, bulbous plant native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the Atlantic coast, thriving in moist, well-drained environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate white or pale pink flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Gagea litoralis plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and supporting local insect populations."
