    "intro": "Gentiana rotata, commonly known as the blue gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and alpine meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Gentiana rotata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
