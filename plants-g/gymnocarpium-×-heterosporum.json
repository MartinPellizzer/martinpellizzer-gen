    "intro": "Gymnocarpium \u00d7 heterosporum, commonly known as the hybrid barrenfruit, is a rare plant species resulting from the cross between Gymnocarpium dryopteris and Gymnocarpium cespitosum. It is a member of the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its unique reproductive structures. The plant produces two types of spores, a feature that distinguishes it as heterosporous. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive fan-like shape. Gymnocarpium \u00d7 heterosporum is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its hybrid nature and ecological significance."
