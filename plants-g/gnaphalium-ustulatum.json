    "intro": "Gnaphalium ustulatum, commonly known as the scorched everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and grasslands, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, and the plant produces a fine, powdery coating on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss. It is often used in native plant gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
