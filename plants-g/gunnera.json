    "intro": "Gunnera, commonly known as the giant rhubarb, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the southern hemisphere, particularly South America, and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped leaves. The leaves can reach several feet in diameter and are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Gunnera species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and wetlands. They produce small, greenish flowers that grow in clusters at the base of the plant."
