    "intro": "Guagnebina suavis, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and glossy, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fragrance of its flowers is particularly strong in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
