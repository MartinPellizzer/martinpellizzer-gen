    "intro": "Gymnadenia secundiflora, commonly known as the lesser butterfly orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, pale pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, usually from July to August, and it is known for its subtle fragrance. Gymnadenia secundiflora is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
