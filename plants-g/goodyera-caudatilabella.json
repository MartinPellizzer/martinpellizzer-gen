    "intro": "Goodyera caudatilabella, commonly known as the long-tailed maidenhair, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cascading stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces intricate, greenish-white flowers with distinctive spurred petals, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing epiphytically on trees or rocks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
