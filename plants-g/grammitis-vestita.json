    "intro": "Grammitis vestita, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain rather than from soil. The plant features delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a silvery, waxy coating, giving it its common name. Its leaves are usually divided into numerous narrow segments, creating a feathery appearance. Grammitis vestita thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests and rainforests."
