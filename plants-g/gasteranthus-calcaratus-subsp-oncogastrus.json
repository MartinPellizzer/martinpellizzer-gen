    "intro": "Gasteranthus calcaratus subsp. oncogastrus, commonly known as the red-flowered gasteranthus, is a striking member of the Rubiaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red, spurred flowers that resemble a crown, which are adapted for specific pollination by birds. The plant typically grows as an epiphytic shrub, anchoring itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its foliage consists of broad, glossy leaves that help in photosynthesis in low-light conditions. The unique floral structure and vivid coloration make it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and a subject of study for its ecological adaptations."
