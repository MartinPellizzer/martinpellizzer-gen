    "intro": "Grammitis alata, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in high humidity and indirect light. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves. Grammitis alata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist environments."
