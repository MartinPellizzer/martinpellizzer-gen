    "intro": "Gomphrena, commonly known as the \"fairy rings\" or \"blush mallow,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Amaranthaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, with species found in areas ranging from Mexico to South America. The plant is characterized by its showy, long-lasting flower heads that come in a variety of colors, including pink, red, and purple. Gomphrena is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils. Its foliage is typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
