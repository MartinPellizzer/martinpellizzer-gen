    "intro": "Guettarda duckei, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green foliage and clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round, green berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds surrounded by a fleshy pulp. Its rapid growth rate and adaptability make it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Guettarda duckei is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its use in traditional medicine."
