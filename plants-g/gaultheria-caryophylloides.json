    "intro": "Gaultheria caryophylloides, commonly known as the Chilean wintergreen, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the southern Andes. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, dark red berries that are highly aromatic. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves contain methyl salicylate, which gives it a distinctive wintergreen scent. Gaultheria caryophylloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
