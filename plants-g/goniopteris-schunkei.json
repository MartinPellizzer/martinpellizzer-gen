    "intro": "Goniopteris schunkei, commonly known as the Schunke's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a feathery appearance. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
