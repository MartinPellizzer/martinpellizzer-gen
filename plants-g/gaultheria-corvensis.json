    "intro": "Gaultheria corvensis, commonly known as the Chilean wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Andes mountains of southern Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by edible berries that are aromatic and slightly tart. Gaultheria corvensis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and high-altitude regions. Its leaves contain compounds that have been traditionally used in folk medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties."
