    "intro": "Gomphandra serrata, commonly known as the serrated gomphandra, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gomphandra serrata is considered a species of conservation concern."
