    "intro": "Geonoma interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often divided into three parts. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is often found on tree trunks or rocks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Geonoma interrupta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
