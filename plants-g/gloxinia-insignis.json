    "intro": "Gloxinia insignis, commonly known as the velvetleaf gloxinia, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to purplish hues. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Gloxinia insignis thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant for indoor or greenhouse settings due to its ornamental value."
