It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The tree produces hard, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to termites. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts."
