    "intro": "Gymnema malayanum, commonly known as the Indian nettle or gymnema, is a climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is known for its unique ability to inhibit the perception of sweetness, a property attributed to the presence of gymnemic acids. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded areas of forests. Its roots and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
