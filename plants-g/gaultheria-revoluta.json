    "intro": "Gaultheria revoluta, commonly known as the red evergreen or red alpine heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with small, elliptical leaves that are typically reddish-brown in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in high-altitude forests and alpine tundra. Gaultheria revoluta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal interest."
