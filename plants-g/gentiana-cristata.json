    "intro": "Gentiana cristata, commonly known as the crested gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine pubescence, while its stem is often branched and covered in small, scale-like structures. The flowers have five to six lobes and are often adorned with a distinctive yellow or white glandular spot at the base."
