    "intro": "Goniopteris biformata, commonly known as the two-formed kidney fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are bipinnate, with pinnae that are often divided into two different forms on either side of the rachis. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are typically found on the fertile pinnae. Its leaves are typically large and have a leathery texture, adapting well to humid, shaded environments. Goniopteris biformata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
