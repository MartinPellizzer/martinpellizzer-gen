It is characterized by its small, leathery, and often hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, creeping habit. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, shield-like appearance on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the leaves, typical of ferns."
