    "intro": "Gearum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the dense, humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bioluminescent properties, which cause its flowers to emit a faint blue glow at night. The plant has a unique structure with translucent, waxy petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Gearum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found near the roots of ancient trees. Its botanical significance lies in its unusual adaptations and potential medicinal properties that are still being studied."
