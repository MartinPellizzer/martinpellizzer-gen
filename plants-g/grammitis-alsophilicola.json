    "intro": "Grammitis alsophilicola, commonly known as the Alsop's spore moss, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant forms dense, mat-like growths on tree trunks and branches, often in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, rounded clusters along the leaf margins. Grammitis alsophilicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical greenhouses."
