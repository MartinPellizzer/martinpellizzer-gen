    "intro": "Gentianella pseudazurea, commonly known as the blue gentian, is a flowering plant belonging to the Gentianaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are slender and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gentianella pseudazurea is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
