    "intro": "Gentiana macgregoryi subsp. piundensis, commonly known as the Piundens gentian, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, known for its showy, blue or violet flowers. The subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, spurred petals that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
