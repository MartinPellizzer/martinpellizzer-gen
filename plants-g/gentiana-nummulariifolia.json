    "intro": "Gentiana nummulariifolia, commonly known as the silver gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
