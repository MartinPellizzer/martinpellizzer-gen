It features fan-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green in summer and turn a striking yellow in autumn. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves seasonally, and is native to China. It is well-suited for small spaces due to its compact form and is often used in urban landscaping. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities."
