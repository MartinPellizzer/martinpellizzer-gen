It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The fronds are typically arching and have a distinctive, kidney-shaped appearance when mature. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates."
