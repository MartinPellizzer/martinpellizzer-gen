    "intro": "Gladiolus benguellensis, commonly known as the Benguella gladiolus, is a rare and striking member of the Iridaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and large, showy flowers that typically come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces intricate, spurred tepals that are typical of the genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
