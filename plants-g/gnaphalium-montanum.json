    "intro": "Gnaphalium montanum, commonly known as mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gnaphalium montanum is often found in rocky meadows and alpine tundra, where it thrives in cool, sunny conditions."
