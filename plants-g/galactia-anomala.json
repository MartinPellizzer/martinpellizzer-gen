    "intro": "Galactia anomala, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its name derives from the milky sap it exudes, which contains latex-like compounds. Galactia anomala is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
