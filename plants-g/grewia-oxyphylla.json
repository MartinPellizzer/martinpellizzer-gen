    "intro": "Grewia oxyphylla, commonly known as the sour fig or red gum, is a small deciduous shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible. The fruits are typically eaten fresh or used in jams and preserves due to their tart flavor. Grewia oxyphylla is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
