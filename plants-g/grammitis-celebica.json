    "intro": "Grammitis celebica, commonly known as the Celebes spleenwort, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is a small, terrestrial moss that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with closely packed, leafy shoots that are often covered in a thin layer of peristome. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Grammitis celebica plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
