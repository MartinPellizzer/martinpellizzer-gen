    "intro": "Gilia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a distinctive yellow or orange center. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, sticky hairs, which give the plant its common name. Gilia glutinosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
