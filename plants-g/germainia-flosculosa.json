    "intro": "Germainia flosculosa, commonly known as the small-flowered germainia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
