    "intro": "Gmelina moluccana var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth gmelina, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by elliptical fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often used in reforestation efforts due to its rapid growth. The variety glabrescens is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to other forms of Gmelina moluccana."
