    "intro": "Galium aparine var. subglabrum, commonly known as bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions. It features slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and have fine, hooked hairs that aid in seed dispersal. Galium aparine var. subglabrum is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in gardens and fields."
