    "intro": "Galium piliferum, commonly known as hairy bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and also covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall textured foliage. Galium piliferum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and streambanks."
