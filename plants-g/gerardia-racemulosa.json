    "intro": "Gerardia racemulosa, commonly known as the clustered gerardia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and prefers moist, sandy soils. It produces small, yellow to brown flowers arranged in a raceme, which is a type of inflorescence. Gerardia racemulosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
