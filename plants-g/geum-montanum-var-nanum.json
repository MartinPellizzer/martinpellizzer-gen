    "intro": "Geum montanum var. nanum, commonly known as mountain avens, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features a compact rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
