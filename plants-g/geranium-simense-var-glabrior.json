It features upright stems that bear clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth, glabrous surface that distinguishes it from other varieties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
