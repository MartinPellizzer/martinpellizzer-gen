    "intro": "Grevillea thyrsoides subsp. pustulata, commonly known as the rough grevillea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, cylindrical inflorescences that bear bright red or orange flowers, which are often clustered in dense, showy spikes. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white, fuzzy hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. This subspecies is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its striking floral display and drought-resistant nature."
