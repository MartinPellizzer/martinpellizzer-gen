    "intro": "Grammadenia parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for photosynthesis, which is a unique adaptation in the orchid family. It produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators like bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Grammadenia parasitica is considered endangered and is protected in many states."
