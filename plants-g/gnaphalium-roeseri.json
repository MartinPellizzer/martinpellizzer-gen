    "intro": "Gnaphalium roeseri, commonly known as the alpine everlasting, is a small, herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces copious amounts of fine,\u7ed2\u6bdb-like hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a similar layer of fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Gnaphalium roeseri is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
