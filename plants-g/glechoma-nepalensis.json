    "intro": "Glechoma nepalensis, commonly known as Himalayan ground ivy, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and adjacent areas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, blue or purple flowers in early summer. Its creeping growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion. Glechoma nepalensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses in local communities."
