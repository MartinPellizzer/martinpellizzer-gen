    "intro": "Gymnogramma gaerdtiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with closely spaced, hair-like pinnae that give the plant its feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
