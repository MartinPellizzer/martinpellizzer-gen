It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and alpine settings."
