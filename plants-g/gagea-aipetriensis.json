    "intro": "Gagea aipetriensis, commonly known as the Caucasian spring beauty, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is adapted to cold climates and blooms in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
