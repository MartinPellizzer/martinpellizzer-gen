    "intro": "Grabowskia duplicata, commonly known as the double-flowered grabowskia, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, double-layered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, adding a unique visual appeal to gardens. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 3 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a branching stem structure that supports its showy floral display. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate species requiring careful cultivation."
