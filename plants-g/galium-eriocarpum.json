    "intro": "Galium eriocarpum, commonly known as the downy wood-sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, sprawling stems covered in soft, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a trifoliate structure, typical of the Rubiaceae family. Its flowers are pale yellow and appear in clusters, often blooming in late spring to early summer. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, contributing to its spread in open, disturbed habitats."
