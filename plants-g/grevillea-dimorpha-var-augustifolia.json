It features narrow, silver-blue leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in clusters, which bloom from late winter to spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract native birds and insects."
