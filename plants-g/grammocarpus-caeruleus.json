    "intro": "Grammocarpus caeruleus, commonly known as the blue-leafed fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that often display a striking blue-green hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures are enclosed in spore-bearing capsules, a feature typical of ferns. The leaves are pinnately divided, with each segment bearing small, clustered sori on the underside."
