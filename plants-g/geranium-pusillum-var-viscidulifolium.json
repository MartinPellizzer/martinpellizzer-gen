    "intro": "Geranium pusillum var. viscidulifolium, commonly known as the sticky-leaved geranium, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features upright stems that bear clusters of small, pink to purple flowers throughout the growing season. The leaves are distinctive for their glandular hairs, which give them a sticky texture and help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
