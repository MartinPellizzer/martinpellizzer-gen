    "intro": "Gymnogramma incisa, commonly known as the cut-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a distinctive, serrated or notched appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Gymnogramma incisa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
