    "intro": "Gnetum globosum, commonly known as the globe gnetum, is a unique gymnosperm native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and the absence of true flowers, which distinguishes it from flowering plants. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, a feature typical of gymnosperms. Its vascular system includes vessel elements, a trait more commonly associated with angiosperms. Gnetum globosum is often found in moist, shaded environments, thriving in humid tropical climates."
