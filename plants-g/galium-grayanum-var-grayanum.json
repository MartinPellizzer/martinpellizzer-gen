    "intro": "Galium grayanum var. grayanum, commonly known as the grayanum bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Galium grayanum var. grayanum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
