    "intro": "Grammitis hirtella, commonly known as hairy grammitis, is a fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance and small, closely packed leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually short and broad, with a hairy texture that gives it its common name. Grammitis hirtella plays a role in maintaining soil moisture and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native range."
