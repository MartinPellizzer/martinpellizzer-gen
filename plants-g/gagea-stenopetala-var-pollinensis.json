    "intro": "Gagea stenopetala var. pollinensis, commonly known as the narrow-petaled gagea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that allow it to survive harsh winters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
