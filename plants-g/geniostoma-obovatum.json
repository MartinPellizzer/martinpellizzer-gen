    "intro": "Geniostoma obovatum, commonly known as the broad-ovate bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are usually reduced to scale-like structures, while the bladders are the primary photosynthetic organs. Geniostoma obovatum is a carnivorous plant that exhibits a unique adaptation for survival in nutrient-poor aquatic habitats."
