    "intro": "Grastidium glebulosum, commonly known as the globular bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, floating, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its specialized bladder cells for nutrient absorption. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its unique morphology and predatory adaptations make it an intriguing subject in botanical studies."
