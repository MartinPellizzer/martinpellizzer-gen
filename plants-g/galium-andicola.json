It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. Galium andicola thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Its botanical features make it an important component of the alpine flora in its native habitat."
