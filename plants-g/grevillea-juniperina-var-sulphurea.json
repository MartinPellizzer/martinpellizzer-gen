    "intro": "Grevillea juniperina var. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur grevillea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange-red flowers, which appear in dense, cylindrical clusters during spring. The leaves are narrow, linear, and have a distinctive blue-green hue with a waxy coating. This variety is well-suited to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
