    "intro": "Guapira amacurensis, commonly known as the Amazonian guapira, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, woody capsules. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
