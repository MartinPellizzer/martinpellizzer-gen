    "intro": "Grammitis doniana, commonly known as the tropical fern, is a species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in ferns. Grammitis doniana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in controlled indoor settings."
