    "intro": "Geum paradoxum, commonly known as the paradoxical avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in soft, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its flowers are typically borne on slender, upright stems that rise above the foliage. Geum paradoxum is adapted to grow in well-drained, rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
