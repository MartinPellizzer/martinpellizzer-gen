    "intro": "Gastrodia tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin arrowroot, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is a tuberous plant that produces a thick, fleshy underground stem, which is the primary part used for medicinal purposes. The plant is characterized by its short, upright stature and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It flowers with small, inconspicuous greenish-white blooms, which are typically followed by the development of its edible tuber. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
