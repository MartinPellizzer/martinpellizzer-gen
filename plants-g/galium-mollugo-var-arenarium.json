    "intro": "Galium mollugo var. arenarium, commonly known as sand bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to sandy soils in Europe and parts of Asia. It features tiny, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to arid or well-drained environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. It is often found in dunes, gravelly soils, and along coastal areas. Its flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and flies, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitats."
