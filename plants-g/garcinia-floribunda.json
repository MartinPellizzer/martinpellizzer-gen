    "intro": "Garcinia floribunda, commonly known as the African star apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces fruit that resembles a star shape, hence its common name, and has a sweet, aromatic pulp. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in moist lowland forests. Garcinia floribunda is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its edible fruit and traditional medicinal uses."
