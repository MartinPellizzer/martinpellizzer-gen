    "intro": "Geonoma telesiana, commonly known as the Brazilian fern, is a species of fern native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the forest floor. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
