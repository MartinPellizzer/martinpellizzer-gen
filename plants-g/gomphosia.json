It is characterized by its woody, often branched stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The flowers are typically clustered in racemes and are usually pink or purple in color. Gomphosia species are native to Africa and are known for their hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional crafts and construction. These plants are also valued for their ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments."
