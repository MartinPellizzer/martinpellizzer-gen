    "intro": "Gramerium, commonly known as the spider lily, is a striking plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, funnel-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early fall, producing clusters of white or pale pink blossoms that resemble spiders, hence its common name. Gramerium has strap-like, grassy leaves that are evergreen in warmer climates and die back in colder regions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soil with partial to full sun."
