    "intro": "Gladiolus edulis, commonly known as the edible gladiolus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves and striking, colorful inflorescences that resemble a sword, giving it its common name. The plant produces edible tubers underground, which are rich in starch and have a mild, sweet flavor. These tubers are often used in local cuisines and can be cooked similarly to potatoes. Botanically, it belongs to the Iridaceae family and is closely related to other ornamental gladiolus species."
