    "intro": "Gnetum latifolium var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf gnetum, is a species of gymnosperm native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and has a unique reproductive system involving both male and female structures on the same plant. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, three-lobed capsule, which is distinctive in appearance. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
