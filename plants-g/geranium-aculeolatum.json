    "intro": "Geranium aculeolatum, commonly known as the prickly geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite leaves that are often hairy and have small, stiff prickles. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Geranium aculeolatum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
