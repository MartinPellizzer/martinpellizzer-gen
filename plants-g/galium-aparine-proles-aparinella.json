    "intro": "Galium aparine proles aparinella, commonly known as cleavers, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, prostrate stems that are covered in fine, hooked hairs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Galium aparine proles aparinella is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in moist meadows."
