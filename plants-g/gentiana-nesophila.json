    "intro": "Gentiana nesophila, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and surrounding mountain ranges. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Gentiana nesophila is a short-lived perennial, with a growth cycle adapted to the extreme conditions of its habitat."
