It features slender, upright stems with clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
