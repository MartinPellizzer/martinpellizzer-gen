It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a red or purple throat. The plant belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Gelseminum azaleiflorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value, though it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
