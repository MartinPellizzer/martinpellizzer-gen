It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its thick, fleshy leaves and deep root system. Its flowers, which are typically pink or purple, bloom during the rainy season and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Geraniospermum dipetalum is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
