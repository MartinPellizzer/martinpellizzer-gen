It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
