It features showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
