    "intro": "Galarhoeus obtusatus, commonly known as the bluntleaf spurge, is a species of flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often toxic species. Galarhoeus obtusatus typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments."
