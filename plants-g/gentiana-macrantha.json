    "intro": "Gentiana macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and alpine meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are upright and bear the showy flowers. Gentiana macrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
