    "intro": "Gymnocarpos debeauxii, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, woody fruits that contain a single seed. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Gymnocarpos debeauxii is well adapted to extreme drought and plays a crucial role in stabilizing desert soils."
