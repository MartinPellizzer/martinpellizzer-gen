It belongs to the family Hypnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in high humidity. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided, lace-like appearance. Gymnogramma ornithopteris is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
