    "intro": "Gladiolus tubiflorus, commonly known as the swamp gladiolus, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features striking, sword-shaped leaves and tall, spike-like inflorescences with showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant thrives in wet or marshy environments, often growing in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Its tuberous roots allow it to survive in waterlogged soils, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland habitats."
