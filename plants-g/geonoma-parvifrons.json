    "intro": "Geonoma parvifrons, commonly known as the small-leaved geonoma, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial bromeliad characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silky hairs, which help in moisture retention. Geonoma parvifrons is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to adapt to indoor growing conditions."
