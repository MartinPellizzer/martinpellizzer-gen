    "intro": "Gomphocarpus rectinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined milkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant has milky sap that is toxic and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape with prominent, parallel veins. Gomphocarpus rectinervis is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
