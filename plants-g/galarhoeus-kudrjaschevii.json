    "intro": "Galarhoeus kudrjaschevii, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, hairy texture, aiding in moisture retention in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic regions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
