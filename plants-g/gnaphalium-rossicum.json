    "intro": "Gnaphalium rossicum, commonly known as Ross's feather grass, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant produces fluffy, white to pale yellow blooms that are often mistaken for cotton due to their soft, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Gnaphalium rossicum is also known for its ability to release a fine, powdery substance from its flowers, which can be carried by the wind."
