    "intro": "Gymnorebutia pulquinensis subsp. mairanensis, commonly known as the Mairanensis Gymnorebutia, is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant produces distinctive yellow or orange flowers that are often visited by pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in succulent gardens due to its unique appearance and resilience."
