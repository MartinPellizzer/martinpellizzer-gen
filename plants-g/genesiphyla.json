    "intro": "Genesiphyla, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. Genesiphyla species are known for their small, clustered growth habit and their ability to thrive in rocky or forested areas. Their spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually arranged in a distinctive pattern on the undersides of the fronds."
