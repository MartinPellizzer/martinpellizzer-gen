    "intro": "Galeata ferruginea, commonly known as the rusted galeata, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in a reddish-brown rust-colored coating, which gives it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a rough, hairy texture."
