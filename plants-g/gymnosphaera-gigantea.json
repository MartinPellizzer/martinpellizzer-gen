    "intro": "Gymnosphaera gigantea, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a unique plant characterized by its large, woody structure and cycad-like appearance. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features a stout, unbranched stem that can grow up to several meters in height, supporting a crown of large, feather-like leaves. Gymnosphaera gigantea produces cones rather than flowers, and its reproductive structures are typically found at the base of the plant. Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
