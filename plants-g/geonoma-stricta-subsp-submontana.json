    "intro": "Geonoma stricta subsp. submontana, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its narrow, upright fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, nutrient-poor soils. The spores are produced in clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns."
