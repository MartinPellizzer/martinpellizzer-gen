    "intro": "Grias cauliflora, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 5 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in clusters at the base of the stems, a trait known as cauliflorous growth. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. The flowers are usually pink or red, with five petals and a prominent central column, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
