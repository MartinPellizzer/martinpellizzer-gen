    "intro": "Galium mollugo var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, ascending stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are linear to narrowly elliptic, typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its flowers are actinomorphic and have five sepals and five petals, with stamens that are longer than the petals. This variant is distinguished by its narrower foliage compared to the typical form of Galium mollugo."
