    "intro": "Greigia mulfordii, commonly known as the mulford's greigia, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy habitats and has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. Its flowers are usually pink or red and bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is of significant conservation concern."
