    "intro": "Gelsemium, commonly known as yellow wood or wild jasmine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Loganiaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, simple leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a tubular shape and a strong, often unpleasant fragrance. Gelsemium species are native to the southeastern United States and parts of Asia, thriving in moist, wooded areas. They are also noted for containing toxic alkaloids, making them both dangerous and valuable in medicinal applications."
