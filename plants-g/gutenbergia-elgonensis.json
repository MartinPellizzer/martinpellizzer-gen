    "intro": "Gutenbergia elgonensis, commonly known as the Elgon mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of Mount Elgon in East Africa. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a short, stout rhizome and a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, spurred flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
