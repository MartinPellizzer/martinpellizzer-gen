    "intro": "Gaultheria oppositifolia, commonly known as the evergreen wintergreen, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, minty flavor due to the presence of methyl salicylate. Gaultheria oppositifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and rocky slopes."
