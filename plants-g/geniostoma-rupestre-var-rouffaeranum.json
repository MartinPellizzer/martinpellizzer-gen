    "intro": "Geniostoma rupestre var. rouffaeranum, commonly known as the Rock Spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and drought tolerance."
