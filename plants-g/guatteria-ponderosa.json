    "intro": "Guatteria ponderosa, commonly known as the large-leafed guatteria, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels and avocado trees, and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, round berries that are often consumed by wildlife. Its growth habit is typically dense and bushy, with a preference for moist, shaded environments in the understory of tropical forests. Guatteria ponderosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
