It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually reduced or absent, giving it a distinctive, almost stem-like appearance. It is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
