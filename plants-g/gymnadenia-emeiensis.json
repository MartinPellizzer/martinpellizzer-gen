    "intro": "Gymnadenia emeiensis, commonly known as the Emei mountain orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in cool, moist habitats such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it has a short flowering period in late summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is highly threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
