    "intro": "Glochidion insectum, commonly known as the insect-fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits resembling figs. Glochidion insectum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in tropical regions."
