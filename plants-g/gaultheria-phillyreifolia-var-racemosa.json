    "intro": "Gaultheria phillyreifolia var. racemosa, commonly known as the red-flowered wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for humans and birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a valuable addition to shaded garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and seasonal floral display."
