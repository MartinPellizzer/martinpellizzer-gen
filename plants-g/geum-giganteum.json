    "intro": "Geum giganteum, commonly known as the giant bergamot, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a red or purple center, blooming from late summer to early autumn. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, moist soil. Geum giganteum is valued in gardens for its vibrant blooms and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
