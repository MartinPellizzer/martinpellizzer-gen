    "intro": "Gunnera scabra, commonly known as the rough gunnera, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its dramatic appearance, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening in cooler climates."
