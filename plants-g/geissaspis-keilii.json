    "intro": "Geissaspis keilii, commonly known as the Keil's geissaspis, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to specific regions in Central Asia, this plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its rarity, it is often found in protected areas and requires careful study to understand its ecological role."
