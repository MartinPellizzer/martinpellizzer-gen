    "intro": "Gilia tenuiflora var. grinnellii, commonly known as the Grinnell's gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its native habitat. The species is part of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is known for its early blooming period, often appearing in late spring."
