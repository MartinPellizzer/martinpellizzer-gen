It is native to the wetlands and marshes of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists studying aquatic plant adaptations."
