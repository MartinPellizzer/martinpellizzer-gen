    "intro": "Genoplesium validum, commonly known as the yellow spider-orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with intricate patterns resembling spider webs, which are a key feature in its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its roots for moisture and nutrients rather than soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette at the base. Genoplesium validum is a rare and protected species, found in specific habitats such as heathlands and rainforests."
