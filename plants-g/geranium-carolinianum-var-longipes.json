    "intro": "Geranium carolinianum var. longipes, commonly known as the Carolina geranium or long-stemmed geranium, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring upright stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady woodlands and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. This variety is distinguished by its longer pedicels compared to the typical form, giving it a more open appearance."
