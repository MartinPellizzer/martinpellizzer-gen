    "intro": "Gossypium perrieri, commonly known as the Perrieri cotton, is a rare and less-studied species of cotton native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its fibrous seed hairs, which are used for textile production. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained soils and a warm climate. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, round bolls that encase the cotton fibers. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it holds significance for biodiversity and potential agricultural research."
