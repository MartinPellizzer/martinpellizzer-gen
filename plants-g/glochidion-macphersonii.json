    "intro": "Glochidion macphersonii, commonly known as the Macpherson's glabrous tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often pubescent leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It typically grows in lowland tropical rainforests and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
