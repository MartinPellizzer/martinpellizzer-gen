    "intro": "Gnaphalon rupestre, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Gnaphalon rupestre is often found on rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, drought-prone conditions."
