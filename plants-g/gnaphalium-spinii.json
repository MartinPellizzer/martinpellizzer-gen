    "intro": "Gnaphalium spinii, commonly known as the spiny cudweed, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. It has finely divided, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Gnaphalium spinii is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
