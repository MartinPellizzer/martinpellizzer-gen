    "intro": "Gourliea, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. They are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, and white. The leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps the plant conserve water. Gourliea species are popular as houseplants due to their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
