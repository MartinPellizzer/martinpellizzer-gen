It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive star-shaped base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the genus. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Glochidion stellatum is often found in tropical and subtropical forests, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
