    "intro": "Gonolobus aristolochiifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, often aromatic leaves and its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant belongs to the family Aristolochiaceae, which includes several species with similar morphological features. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insects, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
