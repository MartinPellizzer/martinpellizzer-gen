    "intro": "Guzmania harrisii, commonly known as the Harris's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range from red to orange in color. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports microfauna and frog species. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Guzmania harrisii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
