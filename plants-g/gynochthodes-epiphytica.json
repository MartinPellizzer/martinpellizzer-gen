    "intro": "Gynochthodes epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic orchid, is a species of orchid that grows on other plants rather than in soil. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that store water, aiding its survival in its epiphytic lifestyle. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in shades of white and green, and are borne on slender stems. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
