    "intro": "Glyceria aquatica var. triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered water grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with three flowers, giving it its varietal name. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, which is common among aquatic plants. The species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
