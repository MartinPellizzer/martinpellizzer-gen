    "intro": "Geranium crithmifolium, commonly known as sea geranium, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Geranium crithmifolium is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
