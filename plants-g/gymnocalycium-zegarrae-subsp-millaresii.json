    "intro": "Gymnocalycium zegarrae subsp. millaresii, commonly known as the Zegarra's moon cactus, is a small, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Peru. It features a compact, globular stem that is typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flowers during the warmer months, usually in spring or early summer. Its subspecies status highlights its distinct characteristics compared to other Gymnocalycium species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
