    "intro": "Gaultheria crassa, commonly known as the broadleaf wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the southern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the winter, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. Gaultheria crassa thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is also valued for its aromatic leaves, which contain methyl salicylate, a compound used in traditional medicine."
