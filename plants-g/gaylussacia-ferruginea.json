    "intro": "Gaylussacia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty leaved huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, woody growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, dark blue berries. Its leaves are elliptical with a rough, rusty-colored underside, giving it its common name. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and moist, shaded areas."
