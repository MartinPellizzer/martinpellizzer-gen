    "intro": "Gymnogramma acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium. Gymnogramma acuminata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
