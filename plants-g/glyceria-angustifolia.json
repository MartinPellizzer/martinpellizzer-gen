    "intro": "Glyceria angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose, cylindrical cluster. Glyceria angustifolia plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic wildlife."
