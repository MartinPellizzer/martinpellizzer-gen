It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers and showy blooms. The plant features slender stems and lanceolate leaves with finely toothed margins, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically blue to violet in color, with a delicate, bell-like structure that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
