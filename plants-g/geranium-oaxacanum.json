It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to red. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a hairy texture that aids in moisture retention. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
