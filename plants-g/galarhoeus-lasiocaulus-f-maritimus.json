    "intro": "Galarhoeus lasiocaulus f. maritimus, commonly known as the coastal woolly grass, is a variant of the woolly grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, grayish-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid or salty environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes or along shorelines. Its compact structure and salt tolerance make it an important pioneer species in coastal restoration projects. The inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of white to pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring."
