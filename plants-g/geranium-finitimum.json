    "intro": "Geranium finitimum, commonly known as the alpine geranium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, helping it retain moisture in its harsh environment. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Geranium finitimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
