    "intro": "Gesneria lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gesneria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped, evergreen leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria lanceolata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
