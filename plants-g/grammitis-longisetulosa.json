    "intro": "Grammitis longisetulosa, commonly known as the long-hair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, feather-like fronds that are covered in fine, long setae, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The fronds are usually evergreen, and the plant reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it a notable species in botanical studies."
