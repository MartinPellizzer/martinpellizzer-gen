    "intro": "Gentiana calycosa var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain gentian, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often found in mountain meadows and subalpine habitats."
