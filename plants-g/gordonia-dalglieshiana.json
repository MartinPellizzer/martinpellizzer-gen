    "intro": "Gordonia dalglieshiana, commonly known as the Dalgliesh's beech, is a rare and distinctive member of the Betulaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it grows in cool, humid climates. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and its unique, drooping inflorescences that produce small, yellowish flowers. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a finely serrated margin. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
