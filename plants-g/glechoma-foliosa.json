    "intro": "Glechoma foliosa, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its spreading growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous stems allow it to spread rapidly, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed. Glechoma foliosa is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and along stream banks."
