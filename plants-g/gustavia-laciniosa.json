    "intro": "Gustavia laciniosa, commonly known as the lace-leaf hibiscus, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
