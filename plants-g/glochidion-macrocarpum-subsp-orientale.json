    "intro": "Glochidion macrocarpum subsp. orientale, commonly known as the oriental glabrous holly, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite, elliptic leaves with a smooth or slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
