    "intro": "Geonoma cuneata var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender-leafed geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to moist, organic-rich soil. The fronds are usually dark green and have a smooth, glossy appearance, making it a visually appealing ornamental plant."
