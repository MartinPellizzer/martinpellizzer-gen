    "intro": "Gymnocalycium piltziorum, commonly known as the Piltziorum cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to southern South America. It is characterized by its globular or cylindrical stem that is typically covered in spines and often has a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which are usually short-lived but attract various pollinators. Gymnocalycium piltziorum is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
