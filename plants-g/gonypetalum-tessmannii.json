It is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a fan shape, typical of the Zingiberaceae family. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and botanical collections."
