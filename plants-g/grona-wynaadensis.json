    "intro": "Grona wynaadensis, commonly known as the Wynaad grass, is a perennial herb native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often in shades of green or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
