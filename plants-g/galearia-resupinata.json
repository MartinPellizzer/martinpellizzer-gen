    "intro": "Galearia resupinata, commonly known as the cushion gentian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with numerous small, fleshy leaves that help it survive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in many regions."
