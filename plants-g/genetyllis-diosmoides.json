    "intro": "Genetyllis diosmoides, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and has a shallow root system to maximize water absorption. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
