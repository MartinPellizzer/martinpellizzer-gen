    "intro": "Gundelia tournefortii var. microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf desert hibiscus, is a low-growing, perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean. It features small, hairy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
