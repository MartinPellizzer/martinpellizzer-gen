    "intro": "Gesneria bulbosa var. faucialis, commonly known as the Faucial gesneria, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green elliptical leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the warm season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
