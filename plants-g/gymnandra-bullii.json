    "intro": "Gymnandra bullii, commonly known as the bull's head cycad, is a unique cycad species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped inflorescence that resembles a bull's head, giving it its common name. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, rough bark. Its leaves are pinnate, with long, narrow leaflets that are often drooping. Gymnandra bullii is a slow-growing, ancient plant that thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water once established."
