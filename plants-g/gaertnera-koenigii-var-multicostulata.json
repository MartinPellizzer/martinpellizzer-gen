It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and robust, woody stems that provide structural support. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiky fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
