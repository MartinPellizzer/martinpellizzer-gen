    "intro": "Glyceria kamtschatica, commonly known as Kamtschatka glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of the Russian Far East and Alaska. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green color. Glyceria kamtschatica is adapted to tolerate frost and is an important component of riparian and wetland ecosystems."
