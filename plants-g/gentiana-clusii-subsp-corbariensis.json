    "intro": "Gentiana clusii subsp. corbariensis, commonly known as the Corbariense gentian, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a perennial herb characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest undergrowth and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
