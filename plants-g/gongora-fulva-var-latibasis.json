    "intro": "Gongora fulva var. latibasis, commonly known as the Orange Ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange petals and a unique, elongated labellum that resembles a ghostly face, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with high air circulation, often growing on tree branches or rocky outcrops. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
