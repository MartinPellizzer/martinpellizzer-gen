    "intro": "Gypsophila paniculata var. effusa, commonly known as the sprig gypsophila, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, delicate, white or pink flowers. The plant has feathery, branched stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and cut flower arrangements. Its ornamental value lies in its airy, lace-like appearance and its ability to bloom reliably in temperate climates."
