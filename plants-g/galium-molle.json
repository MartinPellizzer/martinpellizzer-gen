    "intro": "Galium molle, commonly known as softbed silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually hairy and slightly lance-shaped. Its flowers are white or pale green, clustered in umbels, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Galium molle is often found in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and roadsides."
