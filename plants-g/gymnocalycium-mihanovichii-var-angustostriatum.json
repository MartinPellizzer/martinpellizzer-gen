    "intro": "Gymnocalycium mihanovichii var. angustostriatum, commonly known as the narrow-striated cactus, is a species native to Argentina. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a globular or cylindrical shape. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of narrow, longitudinal ribs that are often adorned with white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
