    "intro": "Gnaphalium viscosum, commonly known as sticky everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its sticky, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. The sticky secretions on its surfaces help deter herbivores and reduce water loss."
