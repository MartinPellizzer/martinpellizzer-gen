It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
