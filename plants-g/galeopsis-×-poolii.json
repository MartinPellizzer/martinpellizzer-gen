It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist environments such as wet meadows and riverbanks. Its hybrid nature results from crossbreeding between Galeopsis tetrahit and Galeopsis speciosa."
