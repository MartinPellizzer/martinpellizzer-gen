It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and densely packed, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The fronds are typically divided into narrow segments with a distinctive, elongated shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in botanical gardens."
