It is characterized by its distinctive spiny stems and leaves, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant ecology and horticulture."
