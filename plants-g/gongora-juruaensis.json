    "intro": "Gongora juruaensis, commonly known as the Juruaense orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the cloud forests of Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that often display a blend of red, yellow, and green hues. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a short, thick rhizome and a single, upright stem. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Gongora juruaensis is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
