    "intro": "Gomphocarpus solstitialis, commonly known as the sunset flower, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often resembling the colors of a sunset. The plant produces a unique, spiky fruit known as a schizocarp, which splits into two parts when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
