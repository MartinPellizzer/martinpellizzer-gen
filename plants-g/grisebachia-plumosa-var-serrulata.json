It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its distinctive, feathery, plumose inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or white, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in a panicle-like arrangement, and are usually pale green or white in color. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in specialized gardens or conservatories due to its specific care requirements."
