It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features slender, prostrate stems that often lie close to the ground, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
