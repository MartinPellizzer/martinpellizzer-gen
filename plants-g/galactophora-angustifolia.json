    "intro": "Galactophora angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, contains cardiac glycosides. Galactophora angustifolia plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is less commonly cultivated than other milkweed species."
