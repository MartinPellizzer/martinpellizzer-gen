It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. This variety is distinguished by its smaller size and specific habitat preferences compared to other varieties of Gagea pusilla."
