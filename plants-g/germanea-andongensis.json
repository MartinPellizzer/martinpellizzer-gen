    "intro": "Germanea andongensis, commonly known as the Andong mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of South Korea. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive pale underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often along forest floors or on rocky substrates. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sorangia, which are clustered on the underside of its fertile fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Germanea andongensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
