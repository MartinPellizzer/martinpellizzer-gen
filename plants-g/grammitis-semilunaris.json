    "intro": "Grammitis semilunaris, commonly known as the moon-shaped fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that often form a semicircular shape, giving it its common name. This fern typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are small, thin, and covered with a fine layer of trichomes, which help in moisture retention. Grammitis semilunaris is often found in cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance in botanical gardens."
