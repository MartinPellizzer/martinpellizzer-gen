    "intro": "Glandularia guaibensis, commonly known as the Guaibense Ironweed, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant produces glandular hairs on its leaves and stems, which may play a role in defense against herbivores or in water retention. Its flowers are typically pink to purple in color, and it blooms during the warmer months. Glandularia guaibensis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
