    "intro": "Gesneria pumila subsp. proctorii, commonly known as the Proctor's gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features broad, glossy, dark green leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of orange and yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
