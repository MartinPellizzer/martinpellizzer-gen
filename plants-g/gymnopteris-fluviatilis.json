    "intro": "Gymnopteris fluviatilis, commonly known as the river fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are often pale green with a slight waxy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Gymnopteris fluviatilis plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
