    "intro": "Galium diffusum, commonly known as spreading bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Galium diffusum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
