    "intro": "Galium aparine var. vaillantii, commonly known as betony fleabane, is a variant of the common bedstraw species. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, grasslands, and along roadsides. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
