    "intro": "Globularia arabica, commonly known as the Arabian globe thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage and is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for Mediterranean climates. Globularia arabica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
