    "intro": "Gahnia microcarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It typically grows in wetland and swampy environments, forming dense tussocks that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It is often found in coastal and inland wetlands, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats. Gahnia microcarpa plays an important role in providing habitat for various wildlife species."
