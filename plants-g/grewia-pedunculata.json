    "intro": "Grewia pedunculata, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red bush willow, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, round, red berries that are a distinctive feature. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Grewia pedunculata is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber due to its hard, durable wood."
