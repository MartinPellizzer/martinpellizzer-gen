    "intro": "Geopatera umbraticola, commonly known as the shadowed ground orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant found in shaded, moist woodland habitats. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem and produces small, clustered leaves that are adapted to low-light conditions. Its roots are highly specialized for absorbing nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its woodland environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
