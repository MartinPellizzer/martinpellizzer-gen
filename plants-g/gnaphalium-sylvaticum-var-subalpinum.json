    "intro": "Gnaphalium sylvaticum var. subalpinum, commonly known as alpine cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It typically reaches heights of 5\u201320 cm and features dense, hairy stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The leaves are linear to lanceolate, often covered in fine pubescence, and are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and specific ecological preferences compared to other members of the genus."
