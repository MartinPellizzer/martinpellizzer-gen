    "intro": "Geum hederifolium, commonly known as creeping oxeye, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, surrounded by white ray florets. The plant has a trailing habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across open ground. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, often with a reddish or purple tinge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks."
