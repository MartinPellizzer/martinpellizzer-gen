It is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
