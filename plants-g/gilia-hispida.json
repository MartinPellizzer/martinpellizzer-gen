    "intro": "Gilia hispida, commonly known as the rough gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Gilia hispida thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and along streambanks. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
