    "intro": "Gymnocalycium bruchii subsp. multicostatum, commonly known as the Multicostate Cactus, is a species native to Argentina. It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed stem that develops a spiny, globose shape as it matures. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but striking. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is prized for its compact growth and ornamental value in cactus collections."
