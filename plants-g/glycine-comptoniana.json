    "intro": "Glycine comptoniana, commonly known as the Compton's soybean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces elongated pods containing edible seeds that are rich in protein and used in traditional cuisines. Glycine comptoniana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and agricultural systems."
