    "intro": "Gomphrena mollis, commonly known as the sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its showy, spiky flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or well-drained soils, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Gomphrena mollis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract pollinators."
