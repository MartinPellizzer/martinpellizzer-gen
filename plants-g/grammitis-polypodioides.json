    "intro": "Grammitis polypodioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on trees or rocks, forming dense, compact clusters with delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its simple, elegant structure makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections."
