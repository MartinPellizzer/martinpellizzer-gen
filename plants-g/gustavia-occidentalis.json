    "intro": "Gustavia occidentalis, commonly known as the West Indian hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The flowers are usually red or pink and bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in tropical environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to coastal and sunny habitats."
