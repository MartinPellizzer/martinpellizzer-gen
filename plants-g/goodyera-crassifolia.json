It is characterized by its dense, moss-like growth habit and features dark green, leathery leaves that are broad and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and is often found in association with decaying organic matter. Goodyera crassifolia is a low-growing plant with a unique appearance that resembles a dense carpet of foliage."
