    "intro": "Gonocarpus trifidus, commonly known as the three-lobed sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are divided into three distinct lobes, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Gonocarpus trifidus is well adapted to saline and coastal environments, making it a hardy species found in mangrove and sandy shore habitats."
