    "intro": "Geissanthus betancurii, commonly known as the Betancurii mountain morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
