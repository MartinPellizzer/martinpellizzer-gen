    "intro": "Geonoma latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf geonoma, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its fronds are usually evergreen, and it produces spores in clusters on the underside of its leaves. Geonoma latifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
