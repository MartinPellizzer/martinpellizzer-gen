    "intro": "Galium laevigatum, commonly known as smooth bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that are often hairy. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, which gives it its common name. Galium laevigatum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
