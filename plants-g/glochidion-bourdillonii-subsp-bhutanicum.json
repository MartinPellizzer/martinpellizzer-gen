    "intro": "Glochidion bourdillonii subsp. bhutanicum, commonly known as the Bhutanese glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to the subtropical regions of Bhutan. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in umbels, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories at moderate elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
