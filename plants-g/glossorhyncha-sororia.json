It is characterized by its delicate, erect shoots that bear closely spaced, lance-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically curved at the tips and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. This moss thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on decaying wood or in forest understories. It plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats."
