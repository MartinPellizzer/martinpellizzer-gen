    "intro": "Gnaphalium obtusifolium var. saxicola, commonly known as stonehead or rock everlasting, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The leaves are typically oblanceolate, with a bluish-gray or silver-green coloration due to a dense covering of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in crevices or on slopes in mountainous regions. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
