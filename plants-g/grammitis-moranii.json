It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance with small, closely spaced leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Grammitis moranii plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
