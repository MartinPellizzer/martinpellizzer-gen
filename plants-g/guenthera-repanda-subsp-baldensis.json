    "intro": "Guenthera repanda subsp. baldensis, commonly known as the Bald Mountain guenthera, is a rare plant species native to the Appalachian Mountains. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats, typically found in rocky or wooded areas. It is adapted to cool, humid climates and is often found at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
