    "intro": "Gaura chinensis, commonly known as Chinese gaura, is a herbaceous perennial native to China and Korea. It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery-blue hue on the upper surface. Gaura chinensis is well-suited for gardens with full sun and well-drained soil, and it is known for its ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
