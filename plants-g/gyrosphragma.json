The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers with ray florets. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Gyrosphragma is characterized by its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil."
