    "intro": "Gaultheria furiens, commonly known as the strawberry bush, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, edible berries in the summer. These berries are noted for their tart flavor and are often used in culinary applications or as a source of natural dye. Gaultheria furiens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils."
