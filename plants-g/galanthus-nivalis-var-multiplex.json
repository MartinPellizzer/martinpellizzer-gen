    "intro": "Galanthus nivalis var. multiplex, commonly known as the snowdrop, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It produces delicate, nodding white flowers with green markings, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to cold climates. It is often found in woodland edges, rock crevices, and shaded areas. Its botanical name reflects its association with snow, as it often flowers when snow is still present."
