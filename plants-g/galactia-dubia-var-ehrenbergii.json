    "intro": "Galactia dubia var. ehrenbergii, commonly known as the Ehrenberg's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its legume-like pods and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant typically grows as a shrub or perennial herb, with trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated, hairy pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local insect populations."
