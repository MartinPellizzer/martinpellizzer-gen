    "intro": "Gossypium aridum, commonly known as the desert cotton, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces fluffy, seed-coated fibers that are adapted to withstand extreme heat and drought conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Despite its name, it is not widely cultivated for commercial cotton production due to its limited yield and specific ecological requirements."
