    "intro": "Guzmania weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's torch fern, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as a microhabitat for various organisms. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, adding ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Guzmania weberbaueri is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
