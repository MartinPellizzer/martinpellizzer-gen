    "intro": "Geranium renifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geranium, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features upright stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or swampy areas. Geranium renifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
