    "intro": "Gagea montana, commonly known as mountain gagea, is a small, perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 7,000 feet. The plant features a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in cold, harsh environments, and it is often found in alpine or subalpine meadows. Gagea montana is an important component of high-elevation ecosystems and is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species."
