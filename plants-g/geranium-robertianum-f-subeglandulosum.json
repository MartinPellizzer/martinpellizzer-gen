    "intro": "Geranium robertianum f. subeglandulosum, commonly known as the lesser cranesbill, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological value. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced glandular structures on the leaves compared to the typical form."
