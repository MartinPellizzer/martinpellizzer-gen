    "intro": "Galanthus peshmenii, commonly known as the Peshmenii snowdrop, is a rare and delicate species of the genus Galanthus. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, specifically found in parts of Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, typically between February and April. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a bulbous underground stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Galanthus peshmenii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
