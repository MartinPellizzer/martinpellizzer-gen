    "intro": "Gentiana makinoi f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered gentian, is a rare and striking botanical specimen native to Japan. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, while its stem is upright and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
