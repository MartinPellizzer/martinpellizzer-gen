    "intro": "Gladiolus bracteolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gladiolus, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features tall, erect stems that bear showy, spike-like inflorescences with brightly colored flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange. The leaves are long and narrow, arranged in two rows along the stem, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. Its botanical name reflects the presence of bract-like structures at the base of the flower clusters. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
