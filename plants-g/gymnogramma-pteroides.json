    "intro": "Gymnogramma pteroides, commonly known as the feather-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Gymnogramma pteroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
