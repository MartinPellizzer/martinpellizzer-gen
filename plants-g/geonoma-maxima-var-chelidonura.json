    "intro": "Geonoma maxima var. chelidonura, commonly known as the broad-leafed geonoma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in forested areas with high humidity. The plant is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, typical of many bromeliads. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
