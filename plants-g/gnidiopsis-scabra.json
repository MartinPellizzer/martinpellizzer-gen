    "intro": "Gnidiopsis scabra, commonly known as the rough gnidiopsis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually rough and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The flowers are small and yellow, often arranged in a dense cluster at the top of the plant."
