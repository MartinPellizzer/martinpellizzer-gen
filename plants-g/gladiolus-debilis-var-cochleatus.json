It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, spiral-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. The spiral arrangement of its flowers is a distinctive characteristic that sets it apart from other gladiolus species."
