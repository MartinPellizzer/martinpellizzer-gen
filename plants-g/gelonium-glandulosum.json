    "intro": "[WRONG START] Gelonia glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky gelonia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright stems covered in soft, glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface. Gelonia glandulosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
