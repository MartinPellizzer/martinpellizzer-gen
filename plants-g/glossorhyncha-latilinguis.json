    "intro": "Glossorhyncha latilinguis, commonly known as the slender horned orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a raceme, with distinctive, elongated sepals and petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
