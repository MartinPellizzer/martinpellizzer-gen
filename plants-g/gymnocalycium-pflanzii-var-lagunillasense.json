    "intro": "Gymnocalycium pflanzii var. lagunillasense, commonly known as the Lagunillas hedgehog cactus, is a small, spiny cactus native to northern Chile. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in arid environments with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
