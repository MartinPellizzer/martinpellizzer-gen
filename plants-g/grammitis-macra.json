    "intro": "Grammitis macra, commonly known as the giant fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis macra is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands."
