    "intro": "Galium corsicum subsp. brachypodum, commonly known as Corsican bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization."
