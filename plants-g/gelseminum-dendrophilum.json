    "intro": "Gelseminum dendrophilum, commonly known as the climbing nightshade, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has dark green, opposite leaves and is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of tropane alkaloids. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories. Despite its ornamental appeal, it should be handled with care due to its poisonous nature."
