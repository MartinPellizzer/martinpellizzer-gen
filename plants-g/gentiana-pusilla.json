    "intro": "Gentiana pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a small perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gentiana pusilla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate beauty."
