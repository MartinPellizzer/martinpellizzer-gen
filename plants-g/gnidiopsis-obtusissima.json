It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. It has a short life cycle, completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in arid ecosystems."
