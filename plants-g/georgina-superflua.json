    "intro": "Georgina superflua, commonly known as the floating nightshade, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its buoyant, broad leaves that allow it to float on the surface of still or slow-moving water. It produces small, violet flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant's roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, making it a common sight in ponds and marshes. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora. Despite its ecological impact, Georgina superflua plays a role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
