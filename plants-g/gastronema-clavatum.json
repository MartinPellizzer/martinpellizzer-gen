    "intro": "Gastronema clavatum, commonly known as the club-shaped liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, dense thallus that often forms a cushion-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures include both male and female gametophytes, which are essential for its sexual reproduction. Gastronema clavatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
