    "intro": "Gordonia, commonly known as the wax tree or candlewood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myricaceae. These plants are characterized by their thick, waxy leaves and their ability to thrive in wet, swampy environments. They are native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America. The bark of some species is used in traditional medicine, and their seeds are often dispersed by water. Gordonia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with some reaching heights of up to 15 meters."
