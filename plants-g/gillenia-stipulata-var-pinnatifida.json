It features showy, white to pale yellow, umbel-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with a pinnate arrangement, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
