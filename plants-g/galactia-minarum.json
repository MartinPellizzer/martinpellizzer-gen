    "intro": "Galactia minarum, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain small, round seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Galactia minarum is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its root nodules. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and native plant landscaping."
