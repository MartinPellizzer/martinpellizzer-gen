    "intro": "Gonostemon giganteus, commonly known as the giant gonostemon, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length, often with a deep green to bluish-green coloration. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, adding visual interest to its foliage. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
