    "intro": "Geum pseudomolle, commonly known as creeping buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with spreading rhizomes and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its aggressive spreading nature, it can become invasive in certain regions."
