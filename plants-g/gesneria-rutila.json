    "intro": "Gesneria rutila, commonly known as the golden gesneria, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green leaves with a slight waxy coating and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of orange and yellow. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is relatively low-maintenance and popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental value. Gesneria rutila is also appreciated for its ability to tolerate moderate drought conditions once established."
