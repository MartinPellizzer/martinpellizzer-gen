    "intro": "Geum canadense f. adenophorum, commonly known as the showy mountain avens, is a botanical variant of the Canadian avens. It is a herbaceous perennial native to North America, particularly found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features upright stems with broad, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are bright yellow, with a central disk surrounded by petal-like bracts, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. This form is distinguished by its more showy and clustered inflorescence compared to the typical form of Geum canadense."
