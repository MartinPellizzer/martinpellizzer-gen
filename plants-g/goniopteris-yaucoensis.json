    "intro": "Goniopteris yaucoensis, commonly known as the Yauco fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean, particularly Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that allows it to spread and colonize moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The Yauco fern is often found in humid, tropical forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in its native habitat."
