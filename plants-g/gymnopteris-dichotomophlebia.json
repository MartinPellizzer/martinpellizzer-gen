    "intro": "Gymnopteris dichotomophlebia, commonly known as the forked vein fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that exhibit a distinctive dichotomous branching pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often produce numerous short, upright stipes. The spores are released from small, clustered sorus structures on the underside of the fronds."
