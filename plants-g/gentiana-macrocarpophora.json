    "intro": "Gentiana macrocarpophora, commonly known as the large-fruited gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and the plant has a fibrous root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across rugged terrains."
