    "intro": "Grammitis tomensis, commonly known as the Tom's spore moss, is a member of the family Hypnaceae and is native to tropical regions of South America. This epiphytic fern typically grows on tree trunks and branches, forming dense, carpet-like mats. Its fronds are narrow, linear, and often have a dark green color with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for its reproductive cycle. Grammitis tomensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
