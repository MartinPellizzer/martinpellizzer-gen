    "intro": "Genista commixta, commonly known as the hybrid broom, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is a shrub that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as woodlands and rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, needle-like leaves. It is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, and it is often found in disturbed or marginal environments. Due to its hybrid nature, it can exhibit a range of morphological variations."
