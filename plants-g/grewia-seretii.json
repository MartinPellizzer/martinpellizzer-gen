    "intro": "Grewia seretii, commonly known as the red gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, elliptical leaves that turn red in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Grewia seretii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native environment."
