    "intro": "Goniophlebium sehnemii, commonly known as the Schenem's goniophlebium, is a rare and unique fern species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, intricate venation pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests or on rocky outcrops. Its spore-producing structures are small and clustered, typical of ferns in this genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
