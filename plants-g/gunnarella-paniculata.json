    "intro": "Gunnarella paniculata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironwood, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink to red in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Gunnarella paniculata is also valued for its hardiness and use in landscaping in desert regions."
