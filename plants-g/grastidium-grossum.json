    "intro": "Grastidium grossum, commonly known as the giant bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in tropical regions. It possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. The plant's stems are typically submerged, with leaves that are modified into bladder-like bladders for capturing prey. It thrives in still or slow-moving water, often found in marshes and ponds. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for studying carnivorous plant adaptations."
