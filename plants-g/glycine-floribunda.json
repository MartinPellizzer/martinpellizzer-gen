    "intro": "Glycine floribunda, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China. It is characterized by its long, flexible stems that can climb and twine around supports. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers in early summer, which are followed by pod fruits containing flat, bean-like seeds. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of 10 to 20 pairs of ovate leaflets. Glycine floribunda is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy floral displays."
