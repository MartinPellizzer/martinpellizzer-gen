    "intro": "Galium asprellum var. lasiocarpum, commonly known as the hairy-fruited bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that are covered in a dense layer of hairs, giving it the \"hairy-fruited\" descriptor. This variant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
