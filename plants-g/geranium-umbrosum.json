    "intro": "Geranium umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a deep green hue. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, and violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
