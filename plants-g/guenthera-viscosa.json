    "intro": "Guenthera viscosa, commonly known as the sticky guenthera, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its dry environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its sticky resin, which gives it its common name, is used by some indigenous communities for medicinal purposes. Guenthera viscosa plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various insects and small animals."
