    "intro": "Gnaphalium arnottii, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow florets arranged in dense clusters, which are often mistaken for individual flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments. Gnaphalium arnottii is also known for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
