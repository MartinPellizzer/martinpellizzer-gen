    "intro": "Gentiana siphonantha var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of the typical species, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The flowers are tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, playing a role in the local ecosystem."
