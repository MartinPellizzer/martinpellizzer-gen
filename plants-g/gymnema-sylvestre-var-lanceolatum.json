    "intro": "Gymnema sylvestre var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the Indian bitter leaf, is a climbing shrub native to the forests of southern and eastern India. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, ovate, and often hairy leaves. The plant is notable for its ability to inhibit the taste of sweetness, a property attributed to the presence of gymnemic acids. Its leaves contain various bioactive compounds, including saponins and flavonoids, which contribute to its medicinal uses. It is widely used in Ayurvedic medicine for its potential hypoglycemic effects."
