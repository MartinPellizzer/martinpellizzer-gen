    "intro": "Geranium minutiflorum, commonly known as the dwarf geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a basal rosette, and it grows to a height of only a few inches. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its compact size and long bloom period make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
