    "intro": "Guazuma coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved guazuma, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its thick, rough bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
