    "intro": "Gentiana germanica var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
