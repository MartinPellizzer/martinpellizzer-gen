    "intro": "Gagea japonica, commonly known as Japanese spring beauty, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features delicate, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its flowers are often short-lived but attract pollinators like bees and flies. Gagea japonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
