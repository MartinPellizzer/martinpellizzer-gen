    "intro": "Gordonia papuana var. montana, commonly known as the mountain gordonia, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Papua New Guinea. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its thick, rugged bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
