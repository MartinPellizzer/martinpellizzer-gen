    "intro": "Guarea cauliflora, commonly known as the panther bean tree, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, palmate leaves that are typically leathery in texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in a cauliflorous pattern, meaning they emerge directly from the trunk or branches. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, often used in traditional medicine. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
