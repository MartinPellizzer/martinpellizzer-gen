    "intro": "Geranium melananthon, commonly known as the black-leaved geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, almost black, glossy leaves that are oval-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
