    "intro": "Gagea saxatilis var. gallica, commonly known as the Gallic spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, appearing in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
