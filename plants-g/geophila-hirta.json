    "intro": "Geophila hirta, commonly known as hairy mountain sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China, Korea, and Japan. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with upright, hairy leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits containing several seeds. Geophila hirta is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
