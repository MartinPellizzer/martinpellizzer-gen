    "intro": "Gagea quettica, commonly known as the Quetica spring beauty, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often persist through the winter, while its flowers are short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators. Gagea quettica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native ecosystems."
