    "intro": "Gagea lutea f. bulbillifera, commonly known as the yellow star-of-Bethlehem bulbiferous form, is a botanical variant of the species Gagea lutea. It is a bulbous perennial plant native to the western United States, particularly California. The plant produces small, yellow, star-shaped flowers in early spring, and its leaves are grass-like and narrow. One distinguishing feature of this form is the presence of bulbils, which are small, vegetative propagules that form along the stem. These bulbils can detach and grow into new plants, making the species highly adaptable and easy to propagate."
