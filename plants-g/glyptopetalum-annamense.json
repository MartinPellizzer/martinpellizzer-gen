    "intro": "Glyptopetalum annamense, commonly known as the Annamese rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers with intricate patterns, often clustered in a raceme. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid climate for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Glyptopetalum annamense is considered a vulnerable species."
