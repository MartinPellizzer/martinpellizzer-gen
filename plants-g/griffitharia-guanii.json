It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, needle-like leaves and conifer-like appearance. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical forests. Its reproductive structures include small, scale-like cones that produce seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
