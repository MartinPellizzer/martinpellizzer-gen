    "intro": "Gnaphalium petraeum, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that grows in rocky and arid environments. The plant features dense clusters of tiny, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
