It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Guazumoides is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
