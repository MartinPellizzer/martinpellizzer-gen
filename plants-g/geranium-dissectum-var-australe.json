    "intro": "Geranium dissectum var. australe, commonly known as the Australian geranium, is a perennial herb native to Australia. It features showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in spring and summer. The plant has finely dissected, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
