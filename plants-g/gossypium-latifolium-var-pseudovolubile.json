    "intro": "Gossypium latifolium var. pseudovolubile, commonly known as the broadleaf cotton or climbing cotton, is a variant of the cotton plant characterized by its wide, heart-shaped leaves. It is a flowering plant in the Malvaceae family, native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into fluffy bolls containing cotton fibers. Its climbing habit is facilitated by tendrils that allow it to grow along supports. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other cotton species but is of interest for its unique morphology and potential for genetic research."
