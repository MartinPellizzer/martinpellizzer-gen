    "intro": "Genista diffusa, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. Genista diffusa is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions."
