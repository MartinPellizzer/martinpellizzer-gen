It is characterized by its large, showy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a woody stem and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
