    "intro": "Gymnadenia nigra var. rubra, commonly known as the red-stemmed bog orchid, is a flowering plant native to moist, acidic habitats in northern regions. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, reddish stems and clusters of pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in bogs, heaths, and other wetland environments, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is distinguished by its reddish coloration, which is more pronounced in the stems compared to the typical green stems of Gymnadenia nigra."
