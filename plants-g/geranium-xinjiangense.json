It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically produces pink to purple blooms during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Geranium xinjiangense is often found in rocky soils and dry grasslands, showcasing its resilience to extreme climatic conditions."
