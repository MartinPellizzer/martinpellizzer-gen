    "intro": "Galvania, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Galvania species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in warm, humid climates. They produce showy, often purple or blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruits are usually small berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals or through mechanical means."
