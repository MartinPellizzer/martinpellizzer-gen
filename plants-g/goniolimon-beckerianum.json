It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheats and sedges, and is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit. The plant typically features small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
