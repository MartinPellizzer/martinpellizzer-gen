It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled flowers, typically in shades of pink or red, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its fruits are distinctive spherical seed capsules that split open to release tiny seeds. This variety is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
