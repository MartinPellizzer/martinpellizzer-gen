    "intro": "Gundelia tournefortii var. araneosae, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to store water, allowing it to survive prolonged droughts. This variety is notable for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
