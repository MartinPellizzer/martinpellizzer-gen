    "intro": "Grindelia hirtella, commonly known as the desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Grindelia hirtella is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
