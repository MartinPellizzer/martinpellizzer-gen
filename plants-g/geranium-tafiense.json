    "intro": "Geranium tafiense, commonly known as the Tafiense geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that are often hairy and bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
