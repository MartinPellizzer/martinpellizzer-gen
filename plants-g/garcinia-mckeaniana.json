    "intro": "Garcinia mckeaniana, commonly known as the Kauai Garcinia, is a rare and endangered species native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is a small evergreen tree that typically grows in wet tropical forests, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. Its fruit contains a single seed and is adapted to disperse via animals, though its population has been severely reduced due to habitat loss. Garcinia mckeaniana is of significant ecological and botanical interest due to its unique evolutionary history and limited distribution."
