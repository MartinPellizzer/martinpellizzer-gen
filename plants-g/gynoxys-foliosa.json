    "intro": "Gynoxys foliosa, commonly known as the Mexican flameflower, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its vibrant red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are opposite and covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Gynoxys foliosa is often cultivated for its showy blooms and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid climates."
