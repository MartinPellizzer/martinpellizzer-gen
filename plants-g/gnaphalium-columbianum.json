    "intro": "Gnaphalium columbianum, commonly known as the Columbian everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a fine, fluffy coating on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss and protects it from herbivores. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant is also noted for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
