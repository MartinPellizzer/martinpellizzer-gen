    "intro": "Geranium dissectum var. baumgartenianum, commonly known as the Baumann's geranium, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to purple, blooming in late summer. The plant has finely dissected, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
