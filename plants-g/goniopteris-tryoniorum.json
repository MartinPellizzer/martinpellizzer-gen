    "intro": "Goniopteris tryoniorum, commonly known as the Tryon's shield fern, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds with a distinctive, elongated central vein. The plant thrived during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, contributing to the formation of coal deposits. Its fronds were typically composed of multiple layers of fertile and sterile leaves, which played a role in its reproductive strategy. Fossil records indicate that Goniopteris tryoniorum was a significant component of ancient swamp ecosystems."
