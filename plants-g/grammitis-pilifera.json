    "intro": "Grammitis pilifera, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in tiny, hair-like structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering. Grammitis pilifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant."
