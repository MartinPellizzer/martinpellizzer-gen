    "intro": "Gagea pedata, commonly known as the clustered dog's mercury, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest understories. Gagea pedata is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
