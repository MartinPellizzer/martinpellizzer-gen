It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves and produces stolons, which allow it to spread and form dense colonies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and mountainous areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in alpine flora and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
