    "intro": "Guibourtia chodatiana, commonly known as African teak, is a tropical tree native to West and Central Africa. It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood with a high oil content, which contributes to its durability and resistance to pests. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, oval seeds. Its leaves are alternate, odd-pinnate, and have a leathery texture. The plant is valued for its ecological role in forest ecosystems and for its economically important timber."
