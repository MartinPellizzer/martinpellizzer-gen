    "intro": "Galactodenia subscabra, commonly known as the rough-stemmed milkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and a distinctive corona. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, is a notable botanical feature. Galactodenia subscabra is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in tropical and subtropical regions."
