    "intro": "Galphimia arenicola, commonly known as the coastal galphimia, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in well-drained soils, often found in sandy or rocky habitats. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Galphimia arenicola is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
