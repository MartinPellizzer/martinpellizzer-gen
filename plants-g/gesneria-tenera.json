    "intro": "Gesneria tenera, commonly known as the velvetleaf gesneria, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often a deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the warm season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria tenera is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
