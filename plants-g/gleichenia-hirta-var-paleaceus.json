    "intro": "Gleichenia hirta var. paleaceus, commonly known as the pale leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the Gleichenia hirta species that exhibits distinctive pale green foliage. It belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are often covered in fine, short hairs. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. The paleaceus variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in horticultural settings."
