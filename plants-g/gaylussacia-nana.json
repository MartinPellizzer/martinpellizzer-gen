    "intro": "Gaylussacia nana, commonly known as dwarf waxplant, is a low-growing shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with dense, evergreen foliage that is often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
