    "intro": "Glechoma hederacea var. parvifolia, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial groundcover plant native to Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller and more rounded than those of the typical Glechoma hederacea. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread quickly, making it both a desirable and potentially invasive species in certain regions."
