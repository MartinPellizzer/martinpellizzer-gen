It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers, and is characterized by its ornamental leaves and showy inflorescences. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often arranged in a racemose pattern.

It is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in tropical gardens and as a decorative foliage plant."
