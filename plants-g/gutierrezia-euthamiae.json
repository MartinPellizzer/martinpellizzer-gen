It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, grayish-green leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.
