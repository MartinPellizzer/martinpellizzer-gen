    "intro": "Gomphrena meyeniana f. levitepala, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gomphrena, is a perennial herb native to South America. It features erect, branching stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright red, pink, or purple flower heads that resemble small, rounded balls, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. This species is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
