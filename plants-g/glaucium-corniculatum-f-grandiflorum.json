    "intro": "Glaucium corniculatum f. grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered gloryflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and related species. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, with a distinctive yellow center. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is noted for its larger, more robust flowers compared to the typical form of Glaucium corniculatum."
