    "intro": "Gastrodia orobanchoides, commonly known as the mountain gastrodia, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of trees such as oak or chestnut. The plant produces a unique, fleshy, and often aromatic underground tuber that is highly valued in traditional medicine. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with a short flowering period, usually in spring. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Gastrodia orobanchoides is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
