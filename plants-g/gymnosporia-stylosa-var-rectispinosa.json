    "intro": "Gymnosporia stylosa var. rectispinosa, commonly known as the straight-spined gymnosporia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of the gymnosperm group. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The leaves are narrow and persistent, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations."
