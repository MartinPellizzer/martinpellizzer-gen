    "intro": "Grewia subspathulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed globemallow, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Grewia subspathulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
