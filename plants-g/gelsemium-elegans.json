    "intro": "Gelsemium elegans, commonly known as yellow false mandrake, is a climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers and smooth, often waxy stems. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Gelsemium elegans is often found in woodland edges and along streambanks, where it can climb trees or shrubs."
