    "intro": "Guilandina portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican climbing bean, is a tropical vine native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its long, climbing stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
