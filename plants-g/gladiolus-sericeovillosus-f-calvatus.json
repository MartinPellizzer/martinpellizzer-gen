    "intro": "Gladiolus sericeovillosus f. calvatus, commonly known as the silky hairy gladiolus form with a smooth stem, is a botanical variant characterized by its unique foliage and floral structure. This form exhibits a reduction in the dense, silky hairs typically found on the stems of the species, resulting in a smoother texture. The leaves are lanceolate and often have a bluish-green hue, while the flowers are typically large and showy, with a range of colors from white to deep red. It is native to South Africa and prefers well-drained soil and full sun. This form is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
