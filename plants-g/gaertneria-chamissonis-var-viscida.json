    "intro": "Gaertneria chamissonis var. viscida, commonly known as the sticky hibiscus, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which can trap small insects. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its fibrous roots and woody stems contribute to its resilience in humid, shaded environments. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique botanical features."
