    "intro": "Gonolobus maritimus, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red in color. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Gonolobus maritimus is adapted to salt spray and can thrive in harsh coastal environments."
