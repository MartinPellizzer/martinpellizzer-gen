    "intro": "Grammitis microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf spikemoss, is a member of the family Huperjiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant features delicate, linear leaves that are densely packed along its upright stems. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Grammitis microphylla is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
