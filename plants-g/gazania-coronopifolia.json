    "intro": "Gazania coronopifolia, commonly known as the crown-of-thorns gazania, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a striking red or orange center. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to reseed itself make it a resilient and hardy ornamental plant."
