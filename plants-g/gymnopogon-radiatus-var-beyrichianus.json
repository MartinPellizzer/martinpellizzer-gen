    "intro": "Gymnopogon radiatus var. beyrichianus, commonly known as the Beyrich's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
