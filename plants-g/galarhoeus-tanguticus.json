    "intro": "Galarhoeus tanguticus, commonly known as the Tangut bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Galarhoeus tanguticus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
