The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It prefers well-drained soil and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Gronovia grandiflora is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
