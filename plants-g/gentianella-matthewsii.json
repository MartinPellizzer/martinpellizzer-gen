It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. It produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
