    "intro": "Glyceria tenuispica, commonly known as narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist habitats such as wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, spikelet-like structures. It produces tiny grains that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Glyceria tenuispica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
