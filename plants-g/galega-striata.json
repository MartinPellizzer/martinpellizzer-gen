    "intro": "Galega striata, commonly known as the striped goat's bean, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive white or yellow stripe running down the central leaflet. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Galega striata is adapted to dry, calcareous soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. It is also known for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal medicine."
