    "intro": "Gypsophila hispida, commonly known as the desert sandpink, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense clusters of small, pink to white flowers. The plant has gray-green foliage covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gypsophila hispida is well adapted to sandy soils and full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
