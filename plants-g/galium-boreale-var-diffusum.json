    "intro": "Galium boreale var. diffusum, commonly known as the northern bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats, and its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
