    "intro": "Gagea sacculifera, commonly known as the sac-like gagea, is a small, perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, grass-like leaves and bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces a unique, sac-like structure at the base of its stem, which is a distinctive botanical feature. It typically blooms in early spring and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Gagea sacculifera is often found in open woodlands and mountainous regions, where it contributes to the local flora diversity."
