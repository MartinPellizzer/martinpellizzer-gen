    "intro": "Gaultheria latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible and have a sharp, minty flavor. Its leaves are broad and leathery, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Gaultheria latifolia is also valued for its aromatic oils, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of wintergreen oil."
