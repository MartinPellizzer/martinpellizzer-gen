    "intro": "Geum franckii, commonly known as the Frank's avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features basal leaves that are heart-shaped with toothed margins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils in woodland or grassland habitats. Geum franckii is often found in alpine or subalpine environments, where it contributes to the biodiversity of rocky and open slopes."
