It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves and delicate, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
