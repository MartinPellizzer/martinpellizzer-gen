It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers, and is characterized by its striking, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, adding visual interest to gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
