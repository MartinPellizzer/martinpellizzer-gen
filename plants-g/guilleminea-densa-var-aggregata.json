    "intro": "Guilleminea densa var. aggregata, commonly known as the clustered guilleminea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a compact growth habit with dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its textured appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
