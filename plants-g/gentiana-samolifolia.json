    "intro": "Gentiana samolifolia, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh weather. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
