    "intro": "Gerardia rigida var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered gerardia, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. This species is notable for its hardiness and ability to survive in extreme climatic conditions."
