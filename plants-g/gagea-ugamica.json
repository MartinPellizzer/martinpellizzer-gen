    "intro": "Gagea ugamica, commonly known as the Ugam lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous roots and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, typically clustered in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
