    "intro": "Galium diabolense, commonly known as devil's-bit scabwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its common name reflects its historical association with witchcraft and its use in folk medicine."
