    "intro": "Goniophlebium lepidopteris, commonly known as the silky fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or along streams. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, silky layer of fine hairs, which contribute to its common name. Goniophlebium lepidopteris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
