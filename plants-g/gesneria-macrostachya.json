    "intro": "Gesneria macrostachya, commonly known as the giant gesneria, is a striking tropical plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its large, broad, dark green leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
