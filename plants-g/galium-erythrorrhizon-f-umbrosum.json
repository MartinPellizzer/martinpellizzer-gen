    "intro": "Galium erythrorrhizon f. umbrosum, commonly known as the shadowy bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, prostrate stems and small, opposite leaves. It produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often covered with fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
