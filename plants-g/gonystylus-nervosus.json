    "intro": "Gonystylus nervosus, commonly known as the narrow-veined ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the islands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark hardwood with a high density and durability, making it highly valued for construction and tool-making. The plant has simple, alternate leaves with prominent venation, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruits are woody capsules that release winged seeds when mature. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Gonystylus nervosus is considered a threatened species in its native range."
