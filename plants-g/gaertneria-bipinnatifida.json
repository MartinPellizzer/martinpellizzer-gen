It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and broad, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals and a prominent central column. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
