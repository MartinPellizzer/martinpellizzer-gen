    "intro": "Gutierrezia glomerella, commonly known as desert gorse, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and grasslands. The plant produces small, yellow, fluffy flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, needle-like, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gutierrezia glomerella is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
