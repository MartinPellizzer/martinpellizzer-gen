    "intro": "Gladiolus tristis var. inodorus, commonly known as the scentless gladiolus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers, though the varietal name \"inodorus\" suggests a lack of scent. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
