It features simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in summer. Its fruits are small, round drupes that turn red when mature. Grewia albiflora is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient plant in dry environments."
