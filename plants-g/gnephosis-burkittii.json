    "intro": "Gnephosis burkittii, commonly known as the Burkitt's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of its leaves, typical of most ferns. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Gnephosis burkittii is considered a vulnerable species."
