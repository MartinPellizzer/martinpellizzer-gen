    "intro": "Grammitis molleri, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of trichomes, giving it a soft, moss-like appearance. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its fronds. Grammitis molleri is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air."
