    "intro": "Grimaldia decora, commonly known as the showy goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. It produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Grimaldia decora is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
