    "intro": "Genyorchis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
