It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in areas with humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that mature to a yellowish color, containing several seeds. Guatteria dolichopoda is often found in lowland rainforests and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and potential medicinal properties."
