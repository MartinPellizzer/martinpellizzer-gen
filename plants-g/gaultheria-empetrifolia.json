    "intro": "Gaultheria empetrifolia, commonly known as the creeping wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a dense, mat-like formation. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. Gaultheria empetrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in woodland areas."
