    "intro": "Galactia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower milkvetch, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, legume-like pods containing several seeds, and its leaves are compound with pairs of oval leaflets. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Galactia uniflora is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
