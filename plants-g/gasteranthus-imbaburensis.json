    "intro": "Gasteranthus imbaburensis, commonly known as the \"flower of the dead,\" is a striking member of the Apocynaceae family native to the highlands of Bolivia. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that resemble a cluster of small, colorful balls, which are actually modified leaves called gynostegium. The plant produces nectar-rich flowers that attract specific pollinators, such as certain species of bees and flies. Its unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
