    "intro": "Geranium eriophorum, commonly known as the woolly geranium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its root system is fibrous, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Geranium eriophorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
