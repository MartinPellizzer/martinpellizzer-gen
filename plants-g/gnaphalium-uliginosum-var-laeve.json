    "intro": "Gnaphalium uliginosum var. laeve, commonly known as the smooth bog everlasting, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with numerous small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features slender, leafless stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often arranged in whorls around the stem. This species is adapted to moist, acidic soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
