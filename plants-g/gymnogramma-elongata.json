    "intro": "Gymnogramma elongata, commonly known as the elongated holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Gymnogramma elongata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
