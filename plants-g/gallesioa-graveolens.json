    "intro": "Gallesioa graveolens, commonly known as the stinking nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces glossy, black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its potent scent and toxic properties, it is considered a challenging species to cultivate."
