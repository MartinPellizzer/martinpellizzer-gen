It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy texture, and its foliage consists of opposite, rounded leaves with a slightly lobed appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or red, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for both gardeners and botanists."
