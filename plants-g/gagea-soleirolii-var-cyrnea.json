    "intro": "Gagea soleirolii var. cyrnea, commonly known as the alpine gagea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale pink bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
