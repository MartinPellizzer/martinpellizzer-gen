    "intro": "Grastidium cyclolobum, commonly known as the cyclolobe cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance. It features a stout, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a fibrous, spongy layer. The plant produces large, fan-shaped leaves that are compound and arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. Its reproductive structures include a terminal cone, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Grastidium cyclolobum is adapted to arid environments, exhibiting a slow growth rate and long lifespan, making it a rare and ecologically significant species."
