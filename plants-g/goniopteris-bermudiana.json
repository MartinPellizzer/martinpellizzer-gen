    "intro": "Goniopteris bermudiana, commonly known as the Bermuda spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern native to Bermuda. It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or along the edges of coastal areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its leaves. Goniopteris bermudiana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
