    "intro": "Ginoria americana var. spinosa, commonly known as the spiny ginoria, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, woodland habitats. The plant features upright stems covered with spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are small, tubular, and usually pink or red, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the branches. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
