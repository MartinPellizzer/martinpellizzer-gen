    "intro": "Gmelina oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf champa, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and elliptical leaves that are usually 5\u201310 cm long. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in terminal panicles. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, winged seeds. Gmelina oblongifolia is valued for its timber and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
