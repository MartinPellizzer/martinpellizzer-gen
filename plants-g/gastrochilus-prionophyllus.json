    "intro": "Gastrochilus prionophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed stone orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
