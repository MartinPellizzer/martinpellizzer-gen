    "intro": "Guapeba neriifolia, commonly known as the black-leaved guapeba, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are often tinged with purple on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the humid tropical climate. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range."
