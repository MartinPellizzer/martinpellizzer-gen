    "intro": "Galium hypocarpium subsp. buxifolium, commonly known as the boxleaf bedstraw, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and small, opposite leaves that resemble those of boxwood, giving it its common name. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The subspecies is distinguished by its leaf morphology and floral structure compared to other members of the Galium genus."
