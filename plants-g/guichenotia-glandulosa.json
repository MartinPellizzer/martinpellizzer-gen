    "intro": "Guichenotia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular guichenotia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often in sandy or gravelly soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to survive in harsh environmental conditions. Guichenotia glandulosa is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
