    "intro": "Garnotia straminea, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically features succulent, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its rocky or sandy habitat. Garnotia straminea is often found in open, well-drained soils and is a common component of tundra and subalpine vegetation. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for survival in extreme climates with limited nutrients and moisture."
