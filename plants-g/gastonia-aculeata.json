    "intro": "Gastonia aculeata, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its spine-tipped stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant's leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and contains a sweet, juicy pulp surrounded by a thick, fibrous outer layer. Gastonia aculeata plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
