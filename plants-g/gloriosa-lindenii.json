    "intro": "Gloriosa lindenii, commonly known as the flame lily, is a striking tropical plant native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its vivid orange-red flowers with contrasting black veins, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant belongs to the Colocasiacae family and is known for its climbing habit, often using its tendrils to ascend supports. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and glossy, adding to its ornamental appeal. However, it is toxic due to the presence of alkaloids, requiring caution during handling."
