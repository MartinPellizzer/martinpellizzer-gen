    "intro": "Gaultheria vaccinioides, commonly known as the dwarf strawberry bush, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or orange in color, with a sweet-tart flavor. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Gaultheria vaccinioides thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
