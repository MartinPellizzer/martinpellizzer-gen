    "intro": "Geonoma margyraffia, commonly known as the slender-leafed geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that often have a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help it anchor in the soil and absorb nutrients. The leaves are usually bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
