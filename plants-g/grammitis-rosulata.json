    "intro": "Grammitis rosulata, commonly known as the rosette fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like arrangement of dark green, leathery leaves. The fronds are typically narrow and have a smooth, glossy surface, with a distinctive midrib running along their length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections."
