    "intro": "Glottis pentaglottis, commonly known as the five-voiced glottis, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, with a strong, spicy scent. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
