    "intro": "Gilia dianthiflora, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with slender stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance. The seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread across open landscapes."
