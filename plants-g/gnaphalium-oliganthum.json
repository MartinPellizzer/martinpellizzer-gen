    "intro": "Gnaphalium oliganthum, commonly known as silverleaf cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It features small, silver-gray leaves covered in fine, silky hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces tiny, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its root system is fibrous and helps it survive in poor soil conditions. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open grasslands."
