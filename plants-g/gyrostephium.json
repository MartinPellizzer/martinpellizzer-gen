    "intro": "Gyrostephium, commonly known as the Mexican ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to Mexico and Central America, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants are shrubs or small trees, characterized by their dense, thorny foliage and woody stems. Their small, pea-like flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and they produce pods that contain edible seeds. Gyrostephium species are valued for their hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
