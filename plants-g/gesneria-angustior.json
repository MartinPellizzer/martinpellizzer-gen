    "intro": "Gesneria angustior, commonly known as the narrowleaf gesneria, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen, strap-like leaves that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often appearing in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria angustior is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
