It is a low-growing herb with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are often surrounded by bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Gnaphalium tricostatum is also known for its aromatic foliage, which can release a mild, camphor-like scent when crushed."
