    "intro": "Geranium thunbergii f. glabratum, commonly known as the smoothleaf geranium, is a compact, mat-forming perennial native to Japan. It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
