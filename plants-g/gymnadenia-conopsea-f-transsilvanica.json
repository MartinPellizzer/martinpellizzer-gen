    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea f. transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian grass of saints, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, fragrant pink or lilac-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and forest edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its floral structure is complex, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
