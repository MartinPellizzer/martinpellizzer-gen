The plant has elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that are dark green in color and often have a waxy texture. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is adapted to the specific microclimates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
