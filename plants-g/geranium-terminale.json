    "intro": "Geranium terminale, commonly known as the rock geranium, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with upright stems and opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
