    "intro": "Geranium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf geranium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact size and vibrant blooms make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
