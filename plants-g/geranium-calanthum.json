    "intro": "Geranium calanthum, commonly known as the creeping geranium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its creeping habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a popular choice for ground cover. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
