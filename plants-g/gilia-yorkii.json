    "intro": "Gilia yorkii, commonly known as the York's gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, thriving in full sun. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Gilia yorkii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
