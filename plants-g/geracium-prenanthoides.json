    "intro": "Geracium prenanthoides, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss through evaporation. Geracium prenanthoides is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils."
