    "intro": "Guardiola odontophylla, commonly known as the toothed leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, tooth-like serrations. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
