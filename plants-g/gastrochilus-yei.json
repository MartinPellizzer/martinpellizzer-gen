    "intro": "Gastrochilus yei, commonly known as the Yei orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a short, stocky rhizome and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Gastrochilus yei is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
