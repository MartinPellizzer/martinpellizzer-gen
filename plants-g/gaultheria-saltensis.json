    "intro": "Gaultheria saltensis, commonly known as the salt marsh strawberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, glossy, dark green leaves and produces tiny, red berries that are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes. Gaultheria saltensis is adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding, making it a hardy species in its native habitat. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
