    "intro": "Grammitis gunnii, commonly known as the silver spruce, is a fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis gunnii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
