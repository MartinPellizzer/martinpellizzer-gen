    "intro": "Grammitis andina, commonly known as the Andean fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis andina is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
