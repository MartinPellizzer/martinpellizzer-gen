    "intro": "Goniopteris domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican water fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a distinctive pattern of sori along the margins. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
