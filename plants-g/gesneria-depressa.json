    "intro": "Gesneria depressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gesneria, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It features broad, elliptical leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of orange and red, typically blooming during the warmer months. Gesneria depressa thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining, moist soil. It is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
