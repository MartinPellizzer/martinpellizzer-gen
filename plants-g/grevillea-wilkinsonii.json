It is characterized by its bright pink or red flowers, which are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences that resemble small, rounded balls. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens.
