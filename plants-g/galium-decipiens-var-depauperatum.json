    "intro": "Galium decipiens var. depauperatum, commonly known as the poorleaf bedstraw, is a flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
