    "intro": "Goodyera maximowicziana, commonly known as the velvet lip orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and small, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring or early summer. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing in forest understories where it forms a compact rosette of leaves. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
