    "intro": "Glycosmis cyanocarpa var. erythrocarpoides, commonly known as the red-fruited chinaberry, is a variant of the chinaberry tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and distinctive red or orange berries that contrast with its green foliage. The plant produces fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is edible but often has a bitter taste, and it contains toxic compounds that can be harmful if ingested in large quantities. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
