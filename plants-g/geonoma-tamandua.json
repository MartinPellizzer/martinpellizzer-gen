    "intro": "Geonoma tamandua, commonly known as the tamandua fern, is a species of fern native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often used in horticultural displays. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. The tamandua fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
