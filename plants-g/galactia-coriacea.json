    "intro": "Galactia coriacea, commonly known as the rough galactia, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody, branched stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval, hairy leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in upright clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, hairy pods containing lens-shaped seeds. Galactia coriacea is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife and livestock."
