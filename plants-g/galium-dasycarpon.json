    "intro": "Galium dasycarpon, commonly known as the woolly bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in dense, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a rough texture due to the presence of glandular hairs. Galium dasycarpon is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks."
