    "intro": "Grammitis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often less than 10 centimeters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing capsules, are located on the underside of its leaves."
