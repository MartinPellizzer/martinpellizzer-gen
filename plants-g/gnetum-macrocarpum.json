    "intro": "Gnetum macrocarpum, commonly known as the giant fan-leafed gnetum, is a gymnosperm native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is notable for its unique reproductive structures. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, red or yellow aril, which aids in seed dispersal. Gnetum macrocarpum is often found in wet, shaded environments such as rainforests and swamps."
