    "intro": "Gomphandra carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina gomphandra, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats, often in shaded areas with rich, acidic soil. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain several seeds. Gomphandra carolinensis is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological niche."
