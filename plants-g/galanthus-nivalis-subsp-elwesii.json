    "intro": "Galanthus nivalis subsp. elwesii, commonly known as the Elwes' snowdrop, is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is native to southern Europe. It is distinguished by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white flowers with a distinctive greenish tinge at the base. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and shady gardens, preferring moist, well-drained soils. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and is valued for its elegant, early-flowering habit. This subspecies is closely related to G. nivalis but is often considered more robust and hardy in colder climates."
