    "intro": "Goldfussia echinata, commonly known as the spiked goldfussia, is a striking perennial plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a distinctive red or orange throat. The plant's most notable botanical feature is its spiky, bracted inflorescence, which gives it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. The leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a slightly waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
