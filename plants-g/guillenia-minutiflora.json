    "intro": "Guillenia minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered guillenia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sandy habitats and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Guillenia minutiflora is often found in coastal and inland grasslands, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
