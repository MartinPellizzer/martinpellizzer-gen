    "intro": "Gleichenia ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori fern, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, strap-like fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in montane forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
