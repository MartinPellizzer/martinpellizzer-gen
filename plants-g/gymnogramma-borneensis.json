    "intro": "Gymnogramma borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean gymnogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant is native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and often form dense mats, contributing to its ability to colonize forest floors effectively. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
