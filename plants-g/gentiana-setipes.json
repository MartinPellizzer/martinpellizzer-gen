    "intro": "Gentiana setipes, commonly known as the tall gentian, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting clusters of bright blue to violet, bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
