    "intro": "Grammitis venulosa, commonly known as the veined maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Grammitis venulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
