    "intro": "Gleditsia triacanthos var. monosperma, commonly known as the honey locust, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into 12\u201320 pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces yellowish-green pods that contain flat, edible seeds, which are often consumed by wildlife and humans alike. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in urban landscaping due to its tolerance of urban conditions. The honey locust also has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a source of durable wood."
