    "intro": "Gentiana rhaetica subsp. solstitialis, commonly known as the Solstitial Gentian, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically around the summer solstice, hence its common name. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is a member of the Gentianaceae family, known for its showy, often blue or purple flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine habitat."
