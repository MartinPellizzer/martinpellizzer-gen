    "intro": "Gmelina philippensis f. transitoria, commonly known as the Philippine ash or Philippine ironwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It is a medium to large evergreen tree characterized by its dark, dense bark and glossy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
