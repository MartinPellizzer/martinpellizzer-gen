    "intro": "Glyptopetalum reticulinerve, commonly known as the reticulate-veined rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to high-altitude regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, hairy foliage and intricate, reticulate venation pattern on its leaves, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers with a unique structure, often featuring a spurred lip that is adapted for specific pollinators. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
