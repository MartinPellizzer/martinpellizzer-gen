    "intro": "Geranium longipedatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
