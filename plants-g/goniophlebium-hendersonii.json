    "intro": "Goniophlebium hendersonii, commonly known as the Henderson's goniophlebium, is a rare fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests or humid woodlands. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the undergrowth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
