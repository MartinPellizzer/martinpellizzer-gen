    "intro": "Gastrorchis simulans, commonly known as the false orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf and a cluster of small, greenish-white flowers. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, Gastrorchis simulans is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
