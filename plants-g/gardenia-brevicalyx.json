    "intro": "Gardenia brevicalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gardenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are shorter and broader than those of other gardenia species. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers with yellow stamens, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Gardenia brevicalyx is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively disease-resistant compared to other gardenia varieties."
