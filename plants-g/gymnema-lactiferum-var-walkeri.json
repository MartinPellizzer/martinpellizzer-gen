    "intro": "Gymnema lactiferum var. walkeri, commonly known as the Indian birch or the sugar leaf plant, is a climbing shrub native to India and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or elliptical. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and red berries that contain the seeds. It is known for its ability to inhibit sweet taste, making it a subject of interest in traditional medicine. The leaves contain compounds such as gymnemic acids, which have been studied for their potential health benefits."
