    "intro": "Galium stebbinsii, commonly known as Stebbins' bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. It produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
