    "intro": "Gleichenia owhyhensis, commonly known as the New Zealand spikemoss, is a member of the family Gleicheniaceae and is native to New Zealand. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a creeping rhizome with erect, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of many ferns. Gleichenia owhyhensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
