    "intro": "Gastorkis tuberogastris, commonly known as the tuberous stomach orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique tuberous roots, which store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces small, intricate flowers with a distinct coloration pattern, often featuring a blend of white, green, and purple hues. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats, typically found in cloud forests or humid lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
