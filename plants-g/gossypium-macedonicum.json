    "intro": "Gossypium macedonicum, commonly known as the Macedonian cotton plant, is a species native to the Balkan region. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces fluffy, white cotton-like fibers that are harvested for textile use. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires a warm growing season. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commercially cultivated cotton species."
