    "intro": "Gesneria splendens, commonly known as the golden torch plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It features striking, elongated leaves that are dark green with a metallic sheen and often have a reddish or orange tint along the edges. The plant produces vibrant orange or red tubular flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria splendens is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
