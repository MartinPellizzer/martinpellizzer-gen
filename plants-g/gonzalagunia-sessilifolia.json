It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and have a serrated margin. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its fruit is a legume that splits open to release seeds, and it has adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained soils. Gonzalagunia sessilifolia is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
