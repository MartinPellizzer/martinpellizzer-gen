    "intro": "Grammitis sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's spikemoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperjaniales. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that are often arranged in two ranks. The plant produces small, club-shaped sporangia at the base of the leaves, which are typically clustered in groups. Grammitis sprucei is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various small organisms."
