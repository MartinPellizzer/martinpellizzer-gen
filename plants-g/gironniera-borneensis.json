    "intro": "Gironniera borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a rare and highly valued tree species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, hard, and durable wood, which has made it a target for illegal logging. The plant belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is known for its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. It typically grows in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests, often reaching heights of up to 30 meters. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Gironniera borneensis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
