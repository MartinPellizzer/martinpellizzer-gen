    "intro": "Grossularia glandulososetosa, commonly known as the woolly gooseberry, is a shrub native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, orange-red berries. The plant produces flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early summer. Its fruit is edible, though it is often used more for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance. The species is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in cool, moist conditions."
