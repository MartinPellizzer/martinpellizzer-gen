    "intro": "Galium decipiens var. scabrum, commonly known as rough bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and covered with fine, rough hairs, giving the plant its \"scabrum\" designation. Small white flowers are arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
