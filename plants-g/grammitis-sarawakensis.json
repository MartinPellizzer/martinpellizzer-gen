    "intro": "Grammitis sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a dense, mat-like structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on tree trunks or branches in the canopy of tropical forests. Its small, intricate leaves are adapted to capture moisture from the air, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. Grammitis sarawakensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its ecosystem by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
