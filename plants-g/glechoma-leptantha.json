    "intro": "Glechoma leptantha, commonly known as the slender ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia and Europe. It features heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Glechoma leptantha is known for its creeping growth habit and ability to spread via stolons, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in gardens."
