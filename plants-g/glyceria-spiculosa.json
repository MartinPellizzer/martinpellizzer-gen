    "intro": "Glyceria spiculosa, commonly known as spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, contributing to wetland health. Glyceria spiculosa is also a food source for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
