    "intro": "Gastrochilus lancifolius, commonly known as the lance-leafed orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinctive lip that is often darker and more textured. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
