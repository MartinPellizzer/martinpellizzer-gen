It is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant has small, lance-shaped pinnae with a serrated margin, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
