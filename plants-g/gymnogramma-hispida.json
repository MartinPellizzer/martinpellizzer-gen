    "intro": "Gymnogramma hispida, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Gymnogramma hispida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
