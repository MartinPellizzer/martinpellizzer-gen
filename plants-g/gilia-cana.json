    "intro": "Gilia cana, commonly known as the pale gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive yellow or orange throat. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early summer, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Gilia cana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
