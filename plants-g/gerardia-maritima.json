    "intro": "Gerardia maritima, commonly known as sea geranium, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and saline environments. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom from summer to autumn. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Gerardia maritima is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
