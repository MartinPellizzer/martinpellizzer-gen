It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a dense covering of fine hairs that help reduce water loss.
