    "intro": "Glia, commonly known as glial cells, are not plants but a type of cell found in the nervous system. They provide structural support, insulation, and nourishment to neurons. While not botanical in nature, they play a crucial role in the function of the brain and spinal cord. Glial cells are categorized into several types, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia. Their importance in neural communication and maintenance is well-documented in neuroscience."
