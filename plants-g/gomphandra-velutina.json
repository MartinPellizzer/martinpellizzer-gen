    "intro": "Gomphandra velutina, commonly known as the velvet gomphandra, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and velvety leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are thick and leathery, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gomphandra velutina is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
