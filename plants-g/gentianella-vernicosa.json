It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a waxy coating, giving them a glossy appearance. Gentianella vernicosa is often found in meadows and mountain slopes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
