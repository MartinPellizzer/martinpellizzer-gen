    "intro": "Gilia diegensis, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its slender, branched stems and narrow leaves are adapted to conserve water in hot, dry conditions. Gilia diegensis plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in restoration projects in its native habitat."
