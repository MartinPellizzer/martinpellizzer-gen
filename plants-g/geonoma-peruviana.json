    "intro": "Geonoma peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian fern, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Peru and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure at the center. Its inflorescence consists of a branched cluster of small, white flowers that bloom sequentially. Geonoma peruviana is often found in humid, shaded environments such as cloud forests, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade."
