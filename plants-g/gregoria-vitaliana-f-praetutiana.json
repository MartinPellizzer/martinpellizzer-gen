    "intro": "Gregoria vitaliana f. praetutiana, commonly known as the Praetutian Violet, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reflect excess light. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
