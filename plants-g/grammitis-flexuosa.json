    "intro": "Grammitis flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are often adorned with small, scale-like structures along the leaf margins. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense carpet of foliage, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
