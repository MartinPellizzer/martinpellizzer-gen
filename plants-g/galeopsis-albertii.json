    "intro": "Galeopsis albertii, commonly known as the Albert's horseweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in whorls along the stems, and it produces small, nut-like fruits. Galeopsis albertii is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
