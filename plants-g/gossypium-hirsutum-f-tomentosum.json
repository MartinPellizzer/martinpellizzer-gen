    "intro": "Gossypium hirsutum f. tomentosum, commonly known as the fuzzy cotton plant, is a hirsute variant of upland cotton. It is characterized by its dense, pubescent foliage and stems, which give it a notably fuzzy appearance. This variety is primarily cultivated for its fibrous seeds, which are used in textile production. The plant typically grows in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its botanical features make it distinct from other cotton varieties, particularly in its hairy texture and growth habits."
