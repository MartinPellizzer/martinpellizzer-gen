    "intro": "Gyptis baccharoides, commonly known as the African silver bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, soft, fuzzy hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its woody stems are often branched and can grow up to several meters in height. Gyptis baccharoides is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
