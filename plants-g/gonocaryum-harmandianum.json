It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid and woody. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in dry, rocky soils. Due to its unique morphology and restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
