    "intro": "Guapira glabriflora, commonly known as the smooth-flowered guapira, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters and features simple, opposite, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers arranged in terminal panicles, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Guapira glabriflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and floral display."
