    "intro": "Grammitis comorensis, commonly known as the Comorian fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its small, clustered sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
