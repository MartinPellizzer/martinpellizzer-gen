    "intro": "Glechoma subsessilis, commonly known as creeping ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and small, fragrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant spreads primarily through rhizomes and stolons, forming dense mats that can colonize a variety of soil types. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks. Glechoma subsessilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings for its ability to suppress weeds."
