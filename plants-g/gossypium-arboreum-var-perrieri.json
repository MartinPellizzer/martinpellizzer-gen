    "intro": "Gossypium arboreum var. perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's tree cotton, is a rare and ancient species of cotton native to the western Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its woody stem and small, fluffy fibers that are distinct from the more commonly cultivated cotton species. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are usually pink or red, and it produces capsules that contain the fibrous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
