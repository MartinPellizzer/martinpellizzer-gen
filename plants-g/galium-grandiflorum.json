    "intro": "Galium grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers, which are white to pale pink, bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits. Galium grandiflorum is often found in the eastern United States and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
