    "intro": "Geissanthus haenkeanus, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are usually broad and oval, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Geissanthus haenkeanus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
