    "intro": "Glandularia origenes, commonly known as the Florida blanketflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a common sight in sandy or rocky habitats. Glandularia origenes is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
