    "intro": "Gothofreda arnottiana, commonly known as the Arnott's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, growing on the trunks and branches of trees without deriving nutrients from its host. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often hidden among the dense foliage of its habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Gothofreda arnottiana is considered critically endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
