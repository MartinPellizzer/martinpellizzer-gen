    "intro": "Geranium dissectum var. carolinianum, commonly known as the Carolina geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely dissected, giving it a lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
