    "intro": "Gynoxys corazonensis, commonly known as the Coraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas or Heart of Jesus, is a rare and unique plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family, known for its striking red, tubular flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has a compact, shrub-like structure with dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
