It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
