    "intro": "Gaultheria procumbens f. suborbiculata, commonly known as the dwarf snowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, glossy, ovate to suborbiculate leaves that are typically dark green and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are edible and often used in traditional medicine for their medicinal properties. The species is well adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments."
