    "intro": "Genista purgans, commonly known as yellow broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its shrub-like growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a common ornamental and ecological plant. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
