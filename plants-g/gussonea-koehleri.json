    "intro": "Gussonea koehleri, commonly known as the Koehleri's lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Gussonea koehleri is a member of the Liliaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like lilies and tulips. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
