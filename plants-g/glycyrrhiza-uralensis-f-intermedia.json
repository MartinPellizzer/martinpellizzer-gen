    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza uralensis f. intermedia, commonly known as the middle Asian licorice, is a variant of the licorice plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, erect growth habit and pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in racemes, followed by pods containing several seeds. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often containing high concentrations of glycyrrhizin, a compound responsible for its sweet taste. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties and is widely used in traditional medicine and herbal remedies."
