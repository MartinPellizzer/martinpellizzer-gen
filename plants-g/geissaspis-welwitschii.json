    "intro": "Geissaspis welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's geissaspis, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of Namibia and Angola. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and small, palmate leaves. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which appear during the rainy season. It is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
