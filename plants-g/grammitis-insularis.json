    "intro": "Grammitis insularis, commonly known as the island fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often used in horticultural displays. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Grammitis insularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
