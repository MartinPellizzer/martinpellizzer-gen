It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found along streams, rivers, and marshes. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy coating. Glyceria alnasteretum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
