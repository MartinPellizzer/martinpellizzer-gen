    "intro": "Gazania pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf gazania, is a compact, low-growing plant native to South Africa. It features vibrant, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its drought tolerance, it is well-suited for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
