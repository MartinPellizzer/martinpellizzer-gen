    "intro": "Gossypium rohrianum, commonly known as the Mexican cotton plant, is a species of shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its soft, fluffy fibers that are harvested for textile use, similar to other cotton species. The plant produces small, white flowers and has palmate leaves with lobed edges. It thrives in warm, arid climates and is often found in dry, rocky soils. Gossypium rohrianum is less commonly cultivated than other cotton varieties but is of interest for its historical and botanical significance."
