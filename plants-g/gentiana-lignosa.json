    "intro": "Gentiana lignosa, commonly known as the wood gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Gentiana lignosa is often found in rocky or woodland soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties."
