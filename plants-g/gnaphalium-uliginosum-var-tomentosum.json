    "intro": "Gnaphalium uliginosum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist and wetland habitats in temperate regions. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically forms compact rosettes and has a mat-like growth habit, which helps it thrive in damp environments. Its leaves are usually covered in fine, white tomentum, giving it a woolly appearance. It is often found in meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
