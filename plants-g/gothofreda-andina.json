    "intro": "Gothofreda andina, commonly known as the Andean ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and striking, bioluminescent flowers that emit a faint glow in the dark. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists alike. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring careful protection."
