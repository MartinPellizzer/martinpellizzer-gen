    "intro": "Gymnanthocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a genus of cacti native to Mexico and Central America. These plants are characterized by their cylindrical stems, which are often ribbed and covered in spines. The flowers, which open at night, are typically large, showy, and brightly colored, ranging from white to pink or yellow. Gymnanthocereus species are adapted to arid environments, storing water in their thick stems and having a shallow root system. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and unique nocturnal flowering habit."
