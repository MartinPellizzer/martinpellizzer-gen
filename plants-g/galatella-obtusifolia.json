    "intro": "Galatella obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved galatella, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a blunt or rounded tip. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale blue flowers during the spring and early summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Galatella obtusifolia is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and dry landscapes."
