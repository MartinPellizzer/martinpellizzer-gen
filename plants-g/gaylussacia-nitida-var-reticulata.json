    "intro": "Gaylussacia nitida var. reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined winterberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its showy, red-orange berries that persist through winter. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are elliptical with a glossy surface and a finely toothed margin, and it produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring. This species is valued for its ornamental berries and its role in supporting local wildlife."
