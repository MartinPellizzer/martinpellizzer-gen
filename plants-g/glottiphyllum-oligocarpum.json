    "intro": "Glottiphyllum oligocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed glottiphyllum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically clustered in whorls and are usually pale green or white in color. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its family."
