    "intro": "Geranium fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered geranium, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are often hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Geranium fasciculatum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
