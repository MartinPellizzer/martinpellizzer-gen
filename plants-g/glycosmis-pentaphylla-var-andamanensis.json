It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers and small, edible fruits that resemble starfruits. The plant typically grows in coastal and moist forest environments, thriving in humid, tropical climates. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a strong, aromatic scent.
