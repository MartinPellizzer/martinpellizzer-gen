    "intro": "Gleditsia aquatica, commonly known as water locust, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 inches long and consist of 15 to 30 oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Gleditsia aquatica thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and swamps."
