    "intro": "Geranium procumbens, commonly known as the creeping geranium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features spreading stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Geranium procumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
