    "intro": "Gnaphalium alatum, commonly known as the silverleaf toothcup, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. Its silver-gray foliage is covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gnaphalium alatum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun."
