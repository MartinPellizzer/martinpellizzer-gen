    "intro": "Geonoma microspatha, commonly known as the small-path fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid lowland forests. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a soft, velvety texture that distinguishes it from other fern species. Geonoma microspatha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
