    "intro": "Grammitis grammitidis, commonly known as the common grammitis, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Grammitis grammitidis plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to the microhabitat diversity and supporting various invertebrate species."
