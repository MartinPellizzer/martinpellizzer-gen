It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing sorus clusters located on the underside of the fronds. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in temperate conditions."
