    "intro": "Gouldia terminalis f. eukapuaensis, commonly known as the Eukapua Gouldia, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. This cultivar is distinguished by its vibrant red bracts that contrast beautifully with its dark green foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil to flourish. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural range, it is highly sought after by plant enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
