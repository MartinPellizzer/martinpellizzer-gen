    "intro": "Gynocardia, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Gynocardia scaposa, which is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and their clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Gynocardia species are typically herbaceous perennials that thrive in moist, shaded environments. They are not commonly cultivated due to their limited ornamental value and their potential toxicity."
