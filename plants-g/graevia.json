    "intro": "Graevia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Graevia thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found growing on the bark of trees. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
