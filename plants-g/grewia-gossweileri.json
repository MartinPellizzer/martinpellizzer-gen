    "intro": "Grewia gossweileri, commonly known as the African snowball, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a hairy texture, while its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Grewia gossweileri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
