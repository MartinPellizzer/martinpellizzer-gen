It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, facilitating its spread across open landscapes. This subspecies is part of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is known for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
