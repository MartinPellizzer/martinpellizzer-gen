    "intro": "Gleichenia pseudoscandens, commonly known as the slender Gleichenia, is a fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is a terrestrial plant characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and dichotomously branched fronds. The fronds are typically narrow and lanceolate, with a smooth, glossy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
