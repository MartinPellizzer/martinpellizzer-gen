    "intro": "Galedupa coriacea, commonly known as the rough galedupa, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
