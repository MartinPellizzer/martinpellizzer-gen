The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 centimeters, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a border plant. It blooms in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate touch to garden spaces. Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in miniature gardens."
