    "intro": "Goodyera carnea, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forest understories. Its leaves are dark green and often have a waxy texture, which helps retain moisture. Goodyera carnea is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, showcasing a complex symbiotic relationship."
