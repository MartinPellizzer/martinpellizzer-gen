    "intro": "Gaultheria merrillii, commonly known as the dwarf wax myrtle, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many shrubs and small trees adapted to acidic soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Its leaves are leathery and fragrant, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Gaultheria merrillii is often found in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
