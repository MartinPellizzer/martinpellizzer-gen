    "intro": "Galium glaucum var. massiliense, commonly known as the Massilian bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found in woodland edges and open habitats. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine, silky hairs that give it a grayish appearance. This variant is distinguished from other Galium species by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences."
