    "intro": "Goodenia rupestris, commonly known as the rock goodenia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Goodeniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The flowers are usually pale blue or violet, with a distinctive tubular shape that attracts pollinators like bees and birds."
