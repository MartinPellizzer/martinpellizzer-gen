    "intro": "Galactia macropoda, commonly known as the large-seeded milkvetch, is a leguminous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces cylindrical pods containing several seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in arid conditions. Galactia macropoda is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and heat. Its role in nitrogen fixation makes it ecologically important in its native habitat."
