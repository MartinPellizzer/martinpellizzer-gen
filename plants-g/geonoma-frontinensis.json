    "intro": "Geonoma frontinensis, commonly known as the Brazilian fern, is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its intricate, feather-like fronds that often exhibit a striking green to reddish hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
