    "intro": "Gnaphalium velutinum, commonly known as velvetleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are covered in a fine, velvety down, giving it a soft texture and aiding in water retention. The flowers produce small, wind-pollinated seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
