    "intro": "Gunnera vestita, commonly known as the velvet giant, is a striking plant native to South America. It belongs to the Gunneraceae family and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests. Its foliage can reach several feet in diameter, making it a dramatic addition to botanical gardens. The flowers, which appear in spring, are small and clustered, often hidden beneath the broad leaves."
