    "intro": "Gentiana microdonta subsp. microdonta, commonly known as the small gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
