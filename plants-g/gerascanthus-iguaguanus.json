    "intro": "Gerascanthus iguaguanus, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the humid lowland forests of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters and emit a subtle fragrance. The plant has strap-like, evergreen leaves that are broad and slightly wavy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
