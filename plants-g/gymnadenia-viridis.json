    "intro": "Gymnadenia viridis, commonly known as the green gentian, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Gymnadenia viridis has strap-like, grassy leaves and produces tall flowering stems that bear clusters of small, tubular flowers. It is often considered a rare and protected species due to habitat loss and over-collection."
