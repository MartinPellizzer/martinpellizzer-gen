    "intro": "Galium orientale var. alpinum, commonly known as alpine woodcrushers, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered with stiff, glandular hairs. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a distinctive waxy coating, while the flowers are small, white, and clustered in cymes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This variant is distinguished from the typical G. orientale by its more compact growth habit and slightly different leaf morphology."
