    "intro": "Geranium macrostylum, commonly known as the large-flowered geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are palmately lobed with a rough texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
