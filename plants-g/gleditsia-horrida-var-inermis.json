    "intro": "Gleditsia horrida var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth honeylocust, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by long, slender pods that contain flattened, edible seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy and adaptable species. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to provide shade in urban and suburban landscapes."
