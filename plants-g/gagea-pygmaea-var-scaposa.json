    "intro": "Gagea pygmaea var. scaposa, commonly known as the dwarf gagea, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has a short growing season. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The variety scaposa is distinguished by its elongated, leafless flower stalks, which elevate the blooms above the foliage."
