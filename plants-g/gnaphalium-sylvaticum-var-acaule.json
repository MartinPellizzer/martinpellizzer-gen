    "intro": "Gnaphalium sylvaticum var. acaule, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open woodland or heathland habitats. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid environment. The species is known for its ability to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
