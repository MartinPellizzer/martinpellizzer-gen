    "intro": "Guzmania strobilifera, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, colorful flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are stiff and often have a waxy coating, which helps in water retention. Guzmania strobilifera is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
