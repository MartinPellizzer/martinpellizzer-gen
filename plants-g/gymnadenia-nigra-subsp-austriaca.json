    "intro": "Gymnadenia nigra subsp. austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian black orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dark purple to black tubular flowers, which are often adorned with yellow or green markings. This subspecies is native to central and eastern Europe, where it thrives in open, calcareous grasslands and heaths. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
