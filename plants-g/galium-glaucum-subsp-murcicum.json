It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often hairy stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Galium glaucum subsp. murcicum thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas."
