It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system, which helps it survive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in heathlands and open woodlands, thriving in full sun. Gastrolobium coriaceum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
