    "intro": "Gardenia gummifera, commonly known as the gum gardenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a sticky, resinous gum from its bark, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and unique botanical features, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
