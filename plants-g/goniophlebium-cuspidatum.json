It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has slender, ribbon-like fronds that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Its leaves are characterized by their narrow, pointed shape and a delicate, feathery appearance. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
