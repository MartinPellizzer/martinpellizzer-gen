    "intro": "Gymnopogon spicatus var. longiaristatus, commonly known as the long-awned goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a hairy texture. The inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with spikelets that bear long, bristle-like awns, giving it its distinctive appearance. This variety is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. Its botanical features make it an important plant in ecological studies and for understanding grassland ecosystems."
