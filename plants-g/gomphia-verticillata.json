    "intro": "Gomphia verticillata, commonly known as the zigzag rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of grass-like leaves that grow in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are typically green or brown and arranged in spikes. Gomphia verticillata thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and marshy areas. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
