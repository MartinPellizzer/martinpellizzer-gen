    "intro": "Grammitis rhodocarpa, commonly known as the red-veined fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with distinct red veins. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Grammitis rhodocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
