    "intro": "Geanthemum cadavericum, commonly known as the corpse flower, is a unique and striking plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble a decaying body, hence its common name. The plant produces a strong, unpleasant odor reminiscent of rotting meat, which serves to attract pollinators such as flies and beetles. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils and requires minimal water. Due to its rare occurrence and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
