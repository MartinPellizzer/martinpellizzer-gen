    "intro": "Grammitis subnuda, commonly known as the naked grammitis, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a narrow, elongated shape. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Grammitis subnuda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
