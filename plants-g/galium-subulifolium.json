    "intro": "Galium subulifolium, commonly known as the needleleaf bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and small white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Galium subulifolium plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
