    "intro": "Glechoma hederacea var. magna, commonly known as large-leaved ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically larger than those of the standard Glechoma hederacea. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is known for its vigorous growth and ability to spread through both stolons and seeds."
