    "intro": "Gomphrena fruticosa, commonly known as the everlasting flower or sea holly, is a shrub-like plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its ability to thrive in salty, sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, spiky flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which retain their color and form even after drying. Its foliage is typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought tolerance and visual appeal. Gomphrena fruticosa is also valued for its use in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms."
