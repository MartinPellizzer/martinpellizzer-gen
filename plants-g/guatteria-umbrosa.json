    "intro": "Guatteria umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy guatteria, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the humid lowland forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded understory environments, where it thrives in high humidity and moderate light conditions. Its small, clustered white or pale pink flowers are followed by edible, fleshy berries that are a food source for various wildlife. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
