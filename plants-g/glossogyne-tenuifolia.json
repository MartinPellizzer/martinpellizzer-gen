    "intro": "Glossogyne tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries. Glossogyne tenuifolia is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded, humid environments."
