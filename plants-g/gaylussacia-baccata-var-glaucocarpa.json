It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy red to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, woodland environments. This variety is distinguished by its bluish-gray leaf pubescence, which gives it its common name."
