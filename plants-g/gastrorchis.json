    "intro": "Gastrorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance, with long, thin roots and a single, slender stem that produces a single, waxy flower. Gastrorchis is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments, often found in the canopy of forests. Due to its specific habitat requirements and declining population, it is considered a vulnerable species."
