    "intro": "Gerardia greggii, commonly known as Gregg's gerardia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with dense, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Gerardia greggii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
