    "intro": "Glottisarcon, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique structure with a single, slender stem and a single, delicate flower that resembles a ghostly apparition. Its leaves are small, waxy, and scale-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. The ghost orchid's botanical significance lies in its ecological role and its status as an indicator of healthy, undisturbed forest ecosystems."
