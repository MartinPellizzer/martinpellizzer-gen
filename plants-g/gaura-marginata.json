    "intro": "Gaura marginata, commonly known as the pink gaura, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant prefers full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens. Its foliage is typically gray-green, adding visual interest even when not in bloom. Gaura marginata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
