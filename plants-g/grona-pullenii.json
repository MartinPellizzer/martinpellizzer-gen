    "intro": "Grona pullenii, commonly known as the purple-veined orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant purple and green veined leaves and clusters of fragrant, lavender-colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for protective measures."
