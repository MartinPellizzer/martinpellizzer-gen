    "intro": "Gnaphalium paludosum var. polylepis, commonly known as the swamp everlasting, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, clustered yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers produce copious amounts of small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its ability to colonize and persist in wetland environments."
