    "intro": "Geranium biuncinatum, commonly known as the clustered geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that bear opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and extended flowering period."
