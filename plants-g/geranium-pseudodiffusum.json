    "intro": "Geranium pseudodiffusum, commonly known as the spreading geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Geranium pseudodiffusum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form dense mats, which help suppress weeds in garden settings."
