    "intro": "Gussonea gilpiniae, commonly known as the Gilpin's gussonea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically pale yellow to white in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
