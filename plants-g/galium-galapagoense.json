    "intro": "Galium galapagoense, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Galium galapagoense thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas and forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
