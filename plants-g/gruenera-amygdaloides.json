    "intro": "Gruenera amygdaloides, commonly known as the sweet almond tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which consist of several oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central axis. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by the development of edible, oily seeds. These seeds are widely used in the production of almond oil and in various culinary applications. Gruenera amygdaloides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and practical benefits."
