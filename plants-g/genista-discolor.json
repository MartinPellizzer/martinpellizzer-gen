    "intro": "Genista discolor, commonly known as the white broom, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, leathery pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Genista discolor thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and rocky habitats. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and long flowering period."
