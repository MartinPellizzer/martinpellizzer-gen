It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with a fine, waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
