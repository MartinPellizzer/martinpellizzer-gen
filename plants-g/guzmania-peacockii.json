    "intro": "Guzmania peacockii, commonly known as the Peacock Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble peacock feathers, giving it its common name. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small aquatic environment for microorganisms and small animals. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale pink, emerge from the center of the rosette and are often overlooked due to the showy bracts. Guzmania peacockii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
