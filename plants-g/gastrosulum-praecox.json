    "intro": "Gastrosulum praecox, commonly known as the early-flowering gastrosulum, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
