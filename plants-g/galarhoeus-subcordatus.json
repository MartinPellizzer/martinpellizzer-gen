    "intro": "Galarhoeus subcordatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed marsh grass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters at the base of the plant. Galarhoeus subcordatus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
