    "intro": "Goodyera daibuzanensis, commonly known as the Daibuzan moss orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance with small, dark green leaves. The plant produces intricate, pale green to white flowers that are typically clustered in a spike. It thrives in shaded, moist forest environments, often growing on decaying tree stumps or among leaf litter. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
