    "intro": "Gnaphalium lorentii, commonly known as the silverleaf everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a thick layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and long-lasting flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and border plantings."
