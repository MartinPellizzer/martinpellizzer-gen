    "intro": "Grammitis nubigena, commonly known as cloud fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear misty or cloud-like, giving it its common name. Native to tropical regions, this plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Grammitis nubigena plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
