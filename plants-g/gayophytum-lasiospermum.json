    "intro": "Gayophytum lasiospermum, commonly known as the woolly sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
