    "intro": "Garcinia brieyi, commonly known as the Malabar tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Clusiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish-bark and elliptical, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits. The fruit contains a single seed surrounded by a sweet, acidic pulp, which is often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. Garcinia brieyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
