    "intro": "Gaultheria depressa, commonly known as the dwarf wax myrtle, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like blueberries and rhododendrons. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. It produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Gaultheria depressa is often found in moist, acidic soils in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
