    "intro": "Gentianella detonsa, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a small perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and are characterized by their narrow, lance-shaped form. Gentianella detonsa is often found in mountainous habitats and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance."
