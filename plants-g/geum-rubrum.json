    "intro": "Geum rubrum, commonly known as the red avens, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The red avens is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
