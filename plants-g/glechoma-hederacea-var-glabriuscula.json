    "intro": "Glechoma hederacea var. glabriuscula, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial groundcover plant native to Europe. It features heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds. This variety is distinguished by its reduced hairy covering compared to the typical form of Glechoma hederacea."
