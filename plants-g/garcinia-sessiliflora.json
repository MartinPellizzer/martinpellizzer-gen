    "intro": "Garcinia sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flower garcinia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are round, fleshy berries that turn red when mature. Garcinia sessiliflora is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
