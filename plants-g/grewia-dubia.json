    "intro": "Grewia dubia, commonly known as the red gum tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, round, red berries that are edible for some animals but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. Grewia dubia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species."
