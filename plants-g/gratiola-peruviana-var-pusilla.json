    "intro": "Gratiola peruviana var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf peruvian grassvetch, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, pale green leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
