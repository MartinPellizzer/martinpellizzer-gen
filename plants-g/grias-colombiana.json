    "intro": "Grias colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the Andes region of Colombia. It is characterized by its striking, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in high-altitude, humid environments. Its foliage forms a rosette that collects rainwater, providing a microhabitat for small organisms. The flowering period of Grias colombiana is brief, making it a rare and sought-after specimen in botanical collections."
