    "intro": "Gomidesia pohliana, commonly known as the Pohliana mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are often dispersed by birds. It plays a role in ecological interactions by influencing host tree health and providing food for wildlife. Due to its specialized growth habits, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
