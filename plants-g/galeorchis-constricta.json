    "intro": "Galeorchis constricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its delicate nature, it is often found in protected environments and is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
