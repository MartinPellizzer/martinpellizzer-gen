    "intro": "Gibasis pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered gibasis, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gibasis pauciflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
