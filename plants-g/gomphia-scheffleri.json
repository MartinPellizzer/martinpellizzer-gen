    "intro": "Gomphia scheffleri, commonly known as the African umbrella plant, is a member of the Restionaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in humid, saline environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in umbels. It is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique appearance and ability to tolerate coastal conditions. However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
