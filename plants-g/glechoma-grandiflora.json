    "intro": "Glechoma grandiflora, commonly known as ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its creeping growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can suppress other vegetation. Glechoma grandiflora is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat respiratory and digestive ailments."
