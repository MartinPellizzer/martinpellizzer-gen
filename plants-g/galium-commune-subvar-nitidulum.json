    "intro": "Galium commune subvar. nitidulum, commonly known as the glossy bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm and features prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by small, bead-like berries. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a shiny, waxy surface, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
