    "intro": "Geissaspis lupulina, commonly known as the yellow star moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and bright yellow-green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its small, scale-like leaves are arranged in a compact rosette, and it produces sporangia that are clustered in specialized structures called soridia. Geissaspis lupulina plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
