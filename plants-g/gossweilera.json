    "intro": "Gossweilera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has no leaves, relying instead on its modified stems for photosynthesis. Its flowers are pale green or white, often resembling a ghostly appearance, which gives it its common name. Due to its specific habitat requirements and habitat loss, Gossweilera is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
