    "intro": "Gossypium paniculatum, commonly known as wild cotton, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, fluffy flowers. The plant produces capsules that contain numerous small seeds, which are surrounded by a fibrous material similar to cotton. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its fibrous seed coverings, it is sometimes referred to as a wild relative of cultivated cotton species."
