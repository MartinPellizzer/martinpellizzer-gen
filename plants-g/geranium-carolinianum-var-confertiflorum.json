It features upright stems that are often hairy, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that have serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks."
