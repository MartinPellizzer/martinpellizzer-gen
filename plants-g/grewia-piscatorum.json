    "intro": "Grewia piscatorum, commonly known as the fish-tail bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that resemble the tail of a fish, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. These flowers give way to red, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. Grewia piscatorum is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
