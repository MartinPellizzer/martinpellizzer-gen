    "intro": "Geonoma ramosissima, commonly known as the hairy leaved fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. Geonoma ramosissima is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
