    "intro": "Grammitis polymorpha, commonly known as the variable maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, toothed segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis polymorpha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
