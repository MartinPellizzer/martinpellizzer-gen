    "intro": "Gnaphalium webbii, commonly known as the silverleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant is notable for its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. Gnaphalium webbii is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in regions with low precipitation."
