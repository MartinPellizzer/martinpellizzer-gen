    "intro": "Gomphocarpus depressus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are typically arranged oppositely. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Gomphocarpus depressus is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
