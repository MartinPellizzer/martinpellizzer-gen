    "intro": "Goniothalamus amuyon, commonly known as the Philippine white wood, is a tropical tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow when mature. It is valued for its durable wood and is often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in its native range."
