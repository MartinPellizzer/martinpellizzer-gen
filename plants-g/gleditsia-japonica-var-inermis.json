It features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, which are followed by flat, brown pods. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in urban environments. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal."
