    "intro": "Glandulifolia mundiifolia, commonly known as the fragrant leaf plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest regions. The plant's leaves are covered in glandular hairs, which secrete essential oils responsible for its distinctive scent. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Glandulifolia mundiifolia is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
