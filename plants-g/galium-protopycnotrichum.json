    "intro": "Galium protopycnotrichum, commonly known as the slender bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia and Europe. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Galium protopycnotrichum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
