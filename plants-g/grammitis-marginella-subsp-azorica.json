    "intro": "Grammitis marginella subsp. azorica, commonly known as the Azorean Grammitis, is a fern species native to the Azores. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or shaded forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in the Polypodiaceae family. It plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat by providing microhabitat for various invertebrates."
