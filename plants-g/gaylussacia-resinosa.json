    "intro": "Gaylussacia resinosa, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a whitish wax layer. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
