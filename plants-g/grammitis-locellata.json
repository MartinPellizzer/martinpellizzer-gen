    "intro": "Grammitis locellata, commonly known as the clustered maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form dense clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are arranged in small clusters on the undersides of the fronds. Grammitis locellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in indoor gardens and greenhouses."
