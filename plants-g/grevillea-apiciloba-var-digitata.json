    "intro": "Grevillea apiciloba var. digitata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Grevillea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal and arid landscapes. Its flowers attract nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to local biodiversity. The variety is distinguished by its more elongated leaves compared to the typical form of Grevillea apiciloba."
