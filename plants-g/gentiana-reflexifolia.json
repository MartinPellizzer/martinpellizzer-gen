    "intro": "Gentiana reflexifolia, commonly known as the reflexed gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or meadow environments. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branched. Its most striking feature is its blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and are clustered in racemes. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
