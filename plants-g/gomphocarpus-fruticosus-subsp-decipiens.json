    "intro": "Gomphocarpus fruticosus subsp. decipiens, commonly known as the \"bottlebrush bush,\" is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes, composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy areas. The flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, and the plant produces capsule fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind."
