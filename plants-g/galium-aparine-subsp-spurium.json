    "intro": "Galium aparine subsp. spurium, commonly known as betony or mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit. It features small, oval to ovate leaves that are often hairy and arranged in pairs along the stems. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, borne in clusters at the leaf axils, and are surrounded by bracts. This subspecies is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides or in meadows. It is a perennial plant that spreads via runners, forming dense mats that can suppress other vegetation."
