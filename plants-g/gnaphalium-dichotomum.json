    "intro": "Gnaphalium dichotomum, commonly known as the forked everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. Gnaphalium dichotomum is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, where it thrives in full sun."
