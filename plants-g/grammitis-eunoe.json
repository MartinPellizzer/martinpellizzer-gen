    "intro": "Grammitis eunoe, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often have a silvery or pale green appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its small, clustered sporangia are borne on the underside of its leaves, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by contributing to forest floor litter and providing microhabitats for small organisms. Grammitis eunoe is often found in shaded, humid environments, where it thrives in the canopy layers of rainforests."
