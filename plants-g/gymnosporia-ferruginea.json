    "intro": "Gymnosporia ferruginea, commonly known as the red-stemmed burr bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in reddish-brown hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by spiny, woody fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture. Gymnosporia ferruginea is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
