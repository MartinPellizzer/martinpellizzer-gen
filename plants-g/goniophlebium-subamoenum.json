It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are often covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, where it thrives in the undergrowth of dense vegetation. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinct, feather-like appearance. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
