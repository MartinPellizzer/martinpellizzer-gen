    "intro": "Gladiolus hirsutus var. aphyllus, commonly known as the naked gladiolus, is a unique variant of the gladiolus species characterized by its lack of leaves. This plant is native to South Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It produces striking, brightly colored flowers that resemble a sword, which is a hallmark feature of the gladiolus genus. The flowers typically bloom in summer and are often used in floral arrangements. Due to its limited foliage, it is an interesting subject for botanical study and cultivation in specific climates."
