    "intro": "Gesneria bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous gesneria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-draining soil. Its bulbous stem structure allows it to store water, making it somewhat drought-tolerant. Gesneria bulbosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and vibrant blooms."
