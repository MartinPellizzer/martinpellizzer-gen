    "intro": "Griselinia littoralis, commonly known as coastal griselinia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows near coastal areas, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange to red berries. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Griselinia littoralis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
