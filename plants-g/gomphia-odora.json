    "intro": "Gomphia odora, commonly known as the fragrant gomphia, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as insects and birds. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Gomphia odora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and scent."
