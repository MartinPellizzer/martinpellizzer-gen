    "intro": "Gahnia exigua, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically less than 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Gahnia exigua plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
