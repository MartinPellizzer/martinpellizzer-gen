It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous areas. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
