    "intro": "Gesneria catalpiflora, commonly known as the Catalpa-flowered gesneria, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria catalpiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unique floral display."
