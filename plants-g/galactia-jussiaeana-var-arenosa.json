It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Its seeds are often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
