    "intro": "Gleditsia amorphoides var. anacantha, commonly known as the thorned honey locust, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10\u201320 inches long and consist of 15\u201330 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods that contain flattened, edible seeds. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. The thorns on its stems and branches provide a defense mechanism against herbivores."
