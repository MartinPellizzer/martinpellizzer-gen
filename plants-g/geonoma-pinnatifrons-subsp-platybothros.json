    "intro": "Geonoma pinnatifrons subsp. platybothros, commonly known as the broad-leafed geonoma, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately divided fronds. The fronds are typically broad and have a leathery texture, with the pinnae arranged in a dense, overlapping pattern. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
