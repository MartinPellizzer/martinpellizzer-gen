    "intro": "Gaultheria acuminata var. nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense, leathery leaves that are silvery-white underneath, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, which are typically white or pale pink. These flowers are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible and have a sharp, peppery flavor. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories."
