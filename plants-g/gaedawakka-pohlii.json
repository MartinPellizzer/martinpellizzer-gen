    "intro": "Gaedawakka pohlii, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its compact size and distinctive, palm-like leaves. The plant has a short, stout trunk and produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Gaedawakka pohlii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
