    "intro": "Gymnadenia acuta, commonly known as the acute grasspinks, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in grassy meadows and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Gymnadenia acuta has a complex root system and produces a single spike of flowers, which are often visited by various pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
