    "intro": "Griffithella willisiana, commonly known as the Willis's griffithella, is a flowering plant species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a velvety texture, while its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
