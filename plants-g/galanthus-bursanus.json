    "intro": "Galanthus bursanus, commonly known as the Bursa snowdrop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its delicate, nodding white flowers with green markings, which bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that form a basal rosette, typical of many bulbous plants. It grows from a bulb and prefers moist, well-drained soils in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Galanthus bursanus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
