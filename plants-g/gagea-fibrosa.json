    "intro": "Gagea fibrosa, commonly known as the fibrous gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or open woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its bulbs are fibrous and store nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh environmental conditions. Gagea fibrosa is often found in alpine or subalpine regions, where it blooms in late spring to early summer."
