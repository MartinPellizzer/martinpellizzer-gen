    "intro": "Grammanthes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, thin roots and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Grammanthes is considered a conservation concern."
