    "intro": "Gentiana irinae, commonly known as the Alpine gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of hair, aiding in water retention in harsh climates. Gentiana irinae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and resilience."
