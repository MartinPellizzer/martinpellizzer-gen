    "intro": "Gyrostachys hostmannii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots and a thick cuticle to reduce water loss. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
