    "intro": "Geranium robertianum var. glabrum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geranium, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems and small, palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairless, giving it its \"glabrum\" designation. The plant produces clusters of delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
