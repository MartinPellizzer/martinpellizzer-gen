    "intro": "Gentiana filistyla, commonly known as the Filistea gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The genus Gentiana is known for its showy flowers and medicinal properties, with G. filistyla being no exception."
