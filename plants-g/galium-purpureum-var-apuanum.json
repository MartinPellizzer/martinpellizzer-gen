    "intro": "Galium purpureum var. apuanum, commonly known as the Apuanum bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. This variety is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical G. purpureum, particularly in leaf shape and flower structure."
