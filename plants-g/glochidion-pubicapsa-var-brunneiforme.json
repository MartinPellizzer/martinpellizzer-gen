    "intro": "Glochidion pubicapsa var. brunneiforme, commonly known as the brown-shouldered glabrous woodvine, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
