    "intro": "Glyceria fluitans var. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial glyceria, is a grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in regions with high humidity and seasonal flooding. This variety is less commonly seen than its aquatic counterpart, Glyceria fluitans, due to its preference for drier, terrestrial conditions."
