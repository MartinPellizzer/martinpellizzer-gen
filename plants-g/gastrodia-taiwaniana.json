    "intro": "Gastrodia taiwaniana, commonly known as the Taiwan ginseng, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Taiwan. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces a unique, fleshy, tuberous structure that is highly valued in traditional medicine. It thrives in shaded, moist forest environments, typically at high altitudes. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
