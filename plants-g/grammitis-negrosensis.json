    "intro": "Grammitis negrosensis, commonly known as Negros Grammitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. Grammitis negrosensis is endemic to the Philippines, specifically the island of Negros, where it grows in moist, rocky habitats."
