It is characterized by its delicate, nodding flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant features strap-like leaves and produces flowers with six petals, often in shades of white or pale yellow. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, Galanthus species are hardy and thrive in woodland or shady garden environments. These plants are also popular for their ornamental value and are often used in horticulture."
