    "intro": "Glandularia lipozygioides, commonly known as the purple glandular eryngo, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which secrete substances that can deter herbivores. Its flowers are typically purple or pink, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
