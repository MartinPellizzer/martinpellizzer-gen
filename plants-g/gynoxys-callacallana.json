    "intro": "Gynoxys callacallana, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Gynoxys callacallana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
