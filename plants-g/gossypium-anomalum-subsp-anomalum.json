    "intro": "Gossypium anomalum subsp. anomalum, commonly known as the desert cotton, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, woolly leaves and produces fluffy, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its fibers, though not as commercially valuable as those of other cotton species, are used in local textile production. The subspecies is notable for its resilience and ecological significance in desert ecosystems."
