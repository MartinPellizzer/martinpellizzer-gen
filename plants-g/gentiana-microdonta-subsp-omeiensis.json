    "intro": "Gentiana microdonta subsp. omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei gentian, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, while its flowers are clustered in racemes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
