    "intro": "Gelsemium sempervirens var. inodorum, commonly known as the sweet yellow false gentian, is a variant of the yellow-flowered winter creeper. It is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves and produces red berries that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Botanically, it is closely related to other gelsemium species but differs in its lack of a strong fragrance."
