    "intro": "Geisarina, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and clusters of bell-shaped, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are small and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Geisarina is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
