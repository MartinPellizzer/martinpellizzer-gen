    "intro": "Goodyera ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow-leaved bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow leaves and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and pine forests. Its rhizomes are short and produce a rosette of leaves that help it retain moisture. Goodyera ochroleuca is an epiphytic or terrestrial orchid, depending on the region, and is often found in acidic, nutrient-poor soils."
