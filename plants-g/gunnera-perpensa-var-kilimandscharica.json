    "intro": "Gunnera perpensa var. kilimandscharica, commonly known as the giant water shield, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1.5 meters in diameter, which are covered in a dense layer of fine, water-repellent hairs. The plant thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found in swampy areas near rivers or lakes. Its flowers, which appear in late summer, are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, typically in shades of yellow or green. This variety is notable for its dramatic appearance and ecological importance in its native habitat."
