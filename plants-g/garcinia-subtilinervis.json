It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a prominent midrib and fine veins, which give it its scientific name. It produces small yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are edible but have a tart flavor. Garcinia subtilinervis is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal properties."
