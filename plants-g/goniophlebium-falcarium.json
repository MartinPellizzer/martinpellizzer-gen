    "intro": "Goniophlebium falcarium, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the family Equisetaceae. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems and whorled arrangement of leaves, which are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, produce spores and are distinctive in appearance. Goniophlebium falcarium is an ancient lineage of vascular plants, with a fossil record dating back to the Carboniferous period."
