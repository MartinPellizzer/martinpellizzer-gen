    "intro": "Gypsophila henrici, commonly known as the Henrici's grass pink, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It has slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
