It is characterized by its unique globular inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, tubular flowers arranged in a compact, cup-like structure. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple in color and bloom in the spring. Globimetula cupulata is adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
