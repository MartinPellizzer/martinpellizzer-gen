    "intro": "Gonolobus diversifolius, commonly known as the variable-leaf morning glory, is a tropical vine belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, often lobed leaves that vary in shape and size, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. It is native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain environments."
