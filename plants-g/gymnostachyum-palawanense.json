It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with elongated, pale green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments on tree trunks or branches in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
