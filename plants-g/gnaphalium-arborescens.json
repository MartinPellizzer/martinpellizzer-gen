    "intro": "Gnaphalium arborescens, commonly known as the tree-like everlasting flower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bushy, upright growth habit and produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its long-lasting flowers are often used in floral arrangements, contributing to its common name."
