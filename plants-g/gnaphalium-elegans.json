    "intro": "Gnaphalium elegans, commonly known as the elegant everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a large number of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to spread in various habitats. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Gnaphalium elegans is often found in rocky soils and open grasslands, where it thrives in full sun."
