It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and montane forests. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
