    "intro": "Gifola robusta, commonly known as the robust ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale, translucent petals and a slender, wiry stem. This plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found epiphytically on tree trunks or branches. Its flowers are small and fragrant, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Gifola robusta is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
