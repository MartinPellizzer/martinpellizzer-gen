    "intro": "Glossorhyncha fusca, commonly known as the dark-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along riverbanks. Its leaves are usually alternate and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. The orchid's root system is specialized, with mycorrhizal associations that aid in nutrient absorption from the soil."
