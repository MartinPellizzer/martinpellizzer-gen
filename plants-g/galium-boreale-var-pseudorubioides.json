    "intro": "Galium boreale var. pseudorubioides, commonly known as the northern bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically features slender, ascending stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy surface. This variant is closely related to other members of the Rubiaceae family and is adapted to thrive in cold, nutrient-poor environments."
