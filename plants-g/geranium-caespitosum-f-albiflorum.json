    "intro": "Geranium caespitosum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered cranesbill, is a compact, mat-forming perennial native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and prolonged flowering period."
