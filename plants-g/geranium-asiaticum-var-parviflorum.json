    "intro": "Geranium asiaticum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Himalayas. It features upright stems that bear opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
