    "intro": "Galium uliginosum var. meratianum, commonly known as the Meratian bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
