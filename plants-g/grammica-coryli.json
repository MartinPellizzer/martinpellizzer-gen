    "intro": "Grammica coryli, commonly known as the hazel grammica, is a lesser-known member of the Betulaceae family. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in certain regions."
