    "intro": "Gastrodia appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate thunder god, is a unique orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other plants. The plant produces a distinctive, fleshy, yellowish-brown tuberous structure that is often harvested for medicinal use. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, with a short, narrow spur. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
