    "intro": "Guatteria acrantha, commonly known as the white-flowered guatteria, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible berries that are yellow or orange when ripe. Guatteria acrantha is often found in moist, shaded understories of tropical forests, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and potential horticultural use."
