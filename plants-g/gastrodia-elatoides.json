    "intro": "Gastrodia elatoides, commonly known as the Chinese thunder god, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on symbiotic fungi for its nutrients. The plant produces a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores energy and is used in traditional Chinese medicine. It blooms with small, pale yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Gastrodia elatoides is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
