It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. The plant features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact growth form compared to the typical species."
