    "intro": "Guettarda ambigua, commonly known as the swamp guettarda, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often near water bodies such as swamps and marshes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a leathery texture with a slightly serrated edge. Guettarda ambigua is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, swampy environments."
