    "intro": "Geissanthus challuayacus, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in shades of white, pink, and violet. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It has simple, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
