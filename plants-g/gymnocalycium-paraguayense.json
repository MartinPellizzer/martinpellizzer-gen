    "intro": "Gymnocalycium paraguayense, commonly known as the Paraguay apple cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil. It is a low-growing cactus with a globular or cylindrical shape, often covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, apple-like fruits that are edible. Gymnocalycium paraguayense thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and minimal water. It is valued both for its ornamental appearance and its historical use in traditional medicine."
