    "intro": "Gasteria, commonly known as the elephant's foot plant, is a succulent perennial native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with white or yellow markings. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear small, tubular flowers, typically in shades of yellow or orange. Gasteria species are drought-tolerant and thrive in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Their unique appearance and low maintenance make them popular houseplants."
