    "intro": "Gentiana pearcei f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, characterized by its showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically reaches a height of less than 10 inches, with lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking color contrast against its dark green foliage."
