    "intro": "Grammitis plana, commonly known as the flat maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in rainforests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Grammitis plana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
