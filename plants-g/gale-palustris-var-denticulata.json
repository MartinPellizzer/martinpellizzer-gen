    "intro": "Gale palustris var. denticulata, commonly known as the serrated bog heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to wet, acidic environments. It features dense clusters of small, dark green leaves that are often serrated along the edges. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in peat bogs and other moist, nutrient-poor soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting diverse wetland wildlife."
