It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers with a distinctive buff-colored lip. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or mountainous regions. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Gongora bufonia is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant and intricate blooms."
