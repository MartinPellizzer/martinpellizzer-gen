    "intro": "Gomphrena fallax, commonly known as the Mexican feather grass, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and feathery, pink or red bracts that resemble plumes. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate, long-lasting inflorescences, which are often used in dried flower arrangements. Gomphrena fallax is drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping, making it a low-maintenance addition to gardens."
