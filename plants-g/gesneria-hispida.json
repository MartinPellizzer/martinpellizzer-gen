    "intro": "Gesneria hispida, commonly known as the woolly gesneria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its thick, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria hispida is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
