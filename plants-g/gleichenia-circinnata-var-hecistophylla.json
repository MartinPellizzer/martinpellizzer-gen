    "intro": "Gleichenia circinnata var. hecistophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf maidenhair fern. It is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae, characterized by its delicate, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually narrow and have a distinctive, arching growth habit. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
