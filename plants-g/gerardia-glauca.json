    "intro": "Gerardia glauca, commonly known as the blue gerardia, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in harsh, cold climates with poor soil conditions. The plant features small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. Gerardia glauca plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
