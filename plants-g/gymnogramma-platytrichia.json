    "intro": "Gymnogramma platytrichia, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and features small, elliptical to ovate leaves with a distinctive, slightly wavy margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in low-light conditions. Its rhizomes are short and thick, contributing to its ability to anchor itself in soil or rock. The fronds are usually dark green and remain throughout the year, making it a hardy and visually appealing addition to shaded gardens."
