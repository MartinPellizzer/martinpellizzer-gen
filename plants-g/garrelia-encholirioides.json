    "intro": "Garrelia encholirioides, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in the spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and the plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh environments. Garrelia encholirioides is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
