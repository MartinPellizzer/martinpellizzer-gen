    "intro": "Gymnocactus viereckii var. major, commonly known as the Mexican snowball cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rounded, fleshy stems that form a dense, ball-like structure. The plant produces clusters of white, fluffy flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, arranged in a tight spiral around the stems. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
