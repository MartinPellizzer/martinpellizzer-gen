    "intro": "Gastrodia menghaiensis, commonly known as Menghai gastrodia, is a rare orchid species native to China, particularly in the Yunnan province. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces unique, fleshy, yellowish-brown pseudobulbs that store nutrients and water. It blooms with small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a spike. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
