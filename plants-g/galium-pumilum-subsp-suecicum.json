    "intro": "Galium pumilum subsp. suecicum, commonly known as the Swedish bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to northern Europe. It typically forms dense mats of slender, prostrate stems covered in fine hairs. The small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in whorls along the stem, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy surface."
