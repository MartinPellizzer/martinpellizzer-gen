    "intro": "Glyceria melicaria, commonly known as the narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats that help stabilize aquatic ecosystems. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Glyceria melicaria plays an important role in wetland habitats by providing food and shelter for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
