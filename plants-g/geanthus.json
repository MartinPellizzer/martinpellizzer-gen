These plants are typically herbaceous and can be found in various habitats, including moist woodlands and meadows. They are characterized by their showy, often yellow or white flowers with five petals. The leaves are usually palmately divided, and the stems are often hairy. Geanthus species are generally short-lived perennials, and they play a role in supporting local pollinators and soil ecosystems."
