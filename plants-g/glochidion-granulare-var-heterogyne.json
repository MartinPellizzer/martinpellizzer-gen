    "intro": "Glochidion granulare var. heterogyne, commonly known as the rough-hairy glochidion, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a rough, granular texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
