    "intro": "Gelasia biebersteinii, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Gelasia biebersteinii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, low-water environments."
