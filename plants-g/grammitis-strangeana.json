    "intro": "Grammitis strangeana, commonly known as the strange fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sorus. Grammitis strangeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
