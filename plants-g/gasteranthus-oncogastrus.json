    "intro": "Gasteranthus oncogastrus, commonly known as the \"gasteranthus\" or \"flowering gasteranthus,\" is a unique plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fleshy, and brightly colored flowers that resemble a stomach, hence its genus name. The plant has a short, erect stem and produces small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. Gasteranthus oncogastrus is also known for its ability to produce a toxic sap, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
