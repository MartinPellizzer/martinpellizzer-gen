    "intro": "Gymnocalycium damsii var. boosii, commonly known as the Boosii moon cactus, is a compact cactus species native to southern South America. It features a spherical or slightly elongated stem covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived. Its foliage is often covered in a powdery coating, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
