    "intro": "Glomera altomontana, commonly known as the Altomontan Glomerate, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
