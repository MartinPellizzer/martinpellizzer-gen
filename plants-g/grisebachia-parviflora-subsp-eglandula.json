It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced or absent glandular structures on its leaves, a feature that sets it apart from other members of the species. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on trees or rocks. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
