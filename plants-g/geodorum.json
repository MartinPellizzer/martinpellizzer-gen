    "intro": "Geodorum, commonly known as the star orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce clusters of fragrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Geodorum species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or other structures rather than in soil. They are popular in horticulture due to their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
