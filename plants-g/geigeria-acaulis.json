    "intro": "Geigeria acaulis, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. Geigeria acaulis is adapted to withstand drought and is often found in rocky outcrops and coastal areas."
