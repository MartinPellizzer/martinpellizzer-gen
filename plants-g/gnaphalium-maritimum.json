    "intro": "Gnaphalium maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and blue to purple flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its small, daisy-like flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gnaphalium maritimum is also known for its aromatic foliage, which contains essential oils and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
