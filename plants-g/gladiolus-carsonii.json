    "intro": "Gladiolus carsonii, commonly known as Carson's gladiolus, is a herbaceous perennial native to the United States, specifically found in the Great Basin region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces large, sword-shaped leaves and has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. It blooms in late summer to early fall, making it a valuable addition to xeriscapic gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
