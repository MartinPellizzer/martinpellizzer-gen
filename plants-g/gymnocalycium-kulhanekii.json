It is characterized by its globular shape and short, ribbed stems that are typically covered in white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It is a succulent plant, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts and indoor gardening."
