    "intro": "Geonoma maxima subsp. hexasticha, commonly known as the broadleaf pteridophyte, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, broad, and often leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to substrates like soil or rock. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it recognizable in its natural habitat."
