    "intro": "Gaultheria undata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible and have a spicy, peppery flavor. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Gaultheria undata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties."
