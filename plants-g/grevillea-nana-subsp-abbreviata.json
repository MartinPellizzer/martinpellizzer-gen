It features small, clustered leaves that are typically green with a slight hairy texture. The plant produces striking, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer to autumn. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
