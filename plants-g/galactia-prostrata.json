    "intro": "Galactia prostrata, commonly known as creeping milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by cylindrical, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are compound, consisting of oval leaflets with a hairy texture. Galactia prostrata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
