It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, violet flowers that are followed by bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Glycine anonychia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
