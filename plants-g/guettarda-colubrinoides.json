    "intro": "Guettarda colubrinoides, commonly known as the coastal guettarda, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows near coastal areas, thriving in sandy or limestone soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in coastal environments. Guettarda colubrinoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils along shorelines."
