    "intro": "Geissaspis cristata, commonly known as the crowned geiss, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive crown-like structure formed by its dense, overlapping leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in temperate regions. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and it blooms in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
