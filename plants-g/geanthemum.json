    "intro": "Geanthemum, commonly known as the everlasting flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). These plants are characterized by their dense, compact growth habit and showy, often brightly colored flower heads. The flowers are typically composed of numerous small florets arranged in a composite head, which gives the plant its daisy-like appearance. Geanthemum species are native to various regions, primarily in Africa and the Mediterranean, and are often found in dry, sunny environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are commonly used in gardens and floral arrangements due to their long-lasting blooms."
