    "intro": "Gnaphalium beneolens, commonly known as the sweet everlasting, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces tiny, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gnaphalium beneolens is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
