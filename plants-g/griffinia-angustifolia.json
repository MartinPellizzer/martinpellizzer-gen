    "intro": "Griffinia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed griffinia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Griffinia angustifolia is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a resilient plant in arid environments."
