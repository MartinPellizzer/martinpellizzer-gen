It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped inflorescence that can reach several feet in height. The plant features vibrant, long-lasting bracts that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often mistaken for flowers. Its leaves are strap-like, arranged in a spiral, and are covered in a dense layer of trichomes that help it retain moisture. Guzmania adscendens thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
