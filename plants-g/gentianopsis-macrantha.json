    "intro": "Gentianopsis macrantha, commonly known as the giant gentian, is a striking perennial herb native to the high elevations of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, white down. Gentianopsis macrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
