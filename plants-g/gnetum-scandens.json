    "intro": "Gnetum scandens, commonly known as the climbing gymnosperm or the tropical gnetum, is a unique plant belonging to the gymnosperm group, which is typically associated with conifers. It is characterized by its woody stems, scale-like leaves, and the production of seeds rather than flowers or fruits. This plant is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, where it often grows as a climbing or shrub-like plant. Its vascular system includes both xylem and phloem, allowing it to efficiently transport water and nutrients. Gnetum scandens exhibits some angiosperm-like features, such as vessel elements in its xylem, making it a subject of interest in plant evolution studies."
