    "intro": "Grastidium sarcodes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on the bark of trees in wetlands or swamps. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Grastidium sarcodes is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
