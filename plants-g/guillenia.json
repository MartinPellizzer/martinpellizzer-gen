    "intro": "Guillenia, commonly known as the common gullwings, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the species. Guillenia thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
