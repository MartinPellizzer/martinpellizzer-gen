    "intro": "Gnaphalium conicum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf featherweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, yellowish flower heads. Gnaphalium conicum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinator populations."
