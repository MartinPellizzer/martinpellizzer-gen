It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, palmate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
