It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain seeds with hooked spines, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and rocky habitats. Gymnosporia swazica is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
