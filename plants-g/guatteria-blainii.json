    "intro": "Guatteria blainii, commonly known as the Blain's guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid lowland forests. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a glossy surface with a distinct aromatic scent. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, and it plays a role in the dispersal of the species by animals."
