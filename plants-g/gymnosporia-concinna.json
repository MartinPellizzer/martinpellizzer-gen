    "intro": "Gymnosporia concinna, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and spiny stems, which are adaptations to its arid environment. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. Gymnosporia concinna is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora in its native habitat."
