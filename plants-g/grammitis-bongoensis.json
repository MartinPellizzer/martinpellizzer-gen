    "intro": "Grammitis bongoensis, commonly known as the Bongo fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis bongoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
