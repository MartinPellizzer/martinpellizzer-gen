It is a member of the Gnetophyta, a group of gymnosperms that includes only three genera. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and unique reproductive structures, including male and female cones. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, orange-red aril, which aids in seed dispersal by animals."
