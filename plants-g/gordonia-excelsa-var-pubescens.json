It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in catkins, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, and it thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
