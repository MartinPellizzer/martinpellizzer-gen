    "intro": "Gumifera vera, commonly known as the sacred gum tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk that exudes a sticky, resinous gum when injured. The leaves are large, broad, and leathery, with a deep green color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fruit that contains a single, hard seed. Its gum has been traditionally used in medicinal and ceremonial practices by indigenous communities."
