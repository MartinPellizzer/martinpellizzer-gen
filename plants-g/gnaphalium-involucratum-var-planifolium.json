    "intro": "Gnaphalium involucratum var. planifolium, commonly known as the flat-leaf cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in dense, spherical heads. The leaves are simple, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and woodland edges. This variant is distinguished by its flat, broad leaves compared to the typical form of the species."
