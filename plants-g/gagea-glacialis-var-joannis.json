    "intro": "Gagea glacialis var. joannis, commonly known as the alpine gagea, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its small, grass-like leaves and delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. It is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous tundra habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
