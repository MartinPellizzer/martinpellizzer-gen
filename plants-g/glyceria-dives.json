    "intro": "Glyceria dives, commonly known as rivergrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist to submerged conditions, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and rivers. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Glyceria dives is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
