    "intro": "Goodyera \u00d7 veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch\u2019s moss orchid, is a hybrid epiphytic orchid native to the eastern United States. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in forested areas. The plant features dense, moss-like foliage with small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Its flowers are delicate, with white petals and a deep violet lip, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments for conservation and horticultural purposes."
