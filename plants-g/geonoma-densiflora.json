    "intro": "Geonoma densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered geonoma, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale green flowers, which are typically borne on short, erect inflorescences. Its leaves are usually long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Geonoma densiflora is often found growing in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests and cloud forests."
