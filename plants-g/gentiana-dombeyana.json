    "intro": "Gentiana dombeyana, commonly known as the Alpine gentian, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and mountain slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to retain moisture in harsh environments. The flowers are tubular with prominent blue or purple petals, and they attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
