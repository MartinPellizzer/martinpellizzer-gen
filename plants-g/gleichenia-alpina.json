    "intro": "Gleichenia alpina, commonly known as the alpine featherbed, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its soft, lobed fronds that resemble a featherbed, giving it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Gleichenia alpina has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its spores are produced in sori located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
