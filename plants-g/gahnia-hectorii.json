    "intro": "Gahnia hectorii, commonly known as Hector's grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets at the top of its stem, which are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in wetland and swampy environments, playing an important ecological role in these habitats. Gahnia hectorii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
