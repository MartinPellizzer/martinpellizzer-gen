    "intro": "Gnaphalium obtusifolium var. helleri, commonly known as Heller's woolyhead, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in heads and bloom in late summer. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
