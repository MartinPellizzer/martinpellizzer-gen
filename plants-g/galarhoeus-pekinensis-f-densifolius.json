    "intro": "Galarhoeus pekinensis f. densifolius, commonly known as the dense-leaved peking willow, is a variant of the peking willow characterized by its dense foliage. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, typical of willow species. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its compact growth and foliage density."
