    "intro": "Goniolimon collinum, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
