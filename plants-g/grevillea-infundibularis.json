It is characterized by its distinctive red stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers in dense, cylindrical clusters, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for native landscaping."
