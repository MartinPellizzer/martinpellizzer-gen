    "intro": "Galium subbiflorum, commonly known as small-flowered bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. Galium subbiflorum is notable for its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion in its native habitats."
