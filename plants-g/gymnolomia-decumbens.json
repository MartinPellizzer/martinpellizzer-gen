It features elongated, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish in color. Gymnolomia decumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and ecological interactions."
