    "intro": "Glochidion nepalense, commonly known as the Nepal glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
