    "intro": "Gonolobus tuerckheimii, commonly known as the yellow flame vine, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows as a vine or shrub, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a slightly hairy texture. Its stems are often woody and can climb or trail along the ground. The flowers are adapted for pollination through their specialized structure, which facilitates the transfer of pollen by visiting insects."
