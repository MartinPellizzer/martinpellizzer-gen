    "intro": "Genista occidentalis, commonly known as coastal broom, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are small, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are woody and branching. Genista occidentalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
