    "intro": "Guzmania sanguinea var. brevipedicellata, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround the central inflorescence, giving it a striking appearance. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports aquatic life. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity. The variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is popular as a decorative houseplant."
