    "intro": "Galarhoeus missouriensis, commonly known as the Missouri marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the central United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for wetland health."
