    "intro": "Gossypium rupestre, commonly known as the rock cotton or desert cotton, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its cotton-like fibers, found in the seed pods, are used in traditional textile production by indigenous communities. Gossypium rupestre is adapted to survive in poor soil conditions and can thrive in regions with low rainfall."
