    "intro": "Galeottia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian galeottia, is a rare and striking member of the Araceae family. It is native to the Andean highlands of Peru and is characterized by its large, showy spatheal flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations between 3,000 and 4,500 meters. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy texture, while its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
