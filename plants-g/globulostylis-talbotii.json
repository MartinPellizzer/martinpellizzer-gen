It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow disc flowers surrounded by white ray florets. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
