    "intro": "Garnotia lata, commonly known as the broadleaf garnotia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its native environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Garnotia lata thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive addition to both wild and cultivated landscapes."
