    "intro": "Gentiana angulosa f. chalybaea, commonly known as the silver gentian, is a rare and striking plant characterized by its vivid blue to violet flowers. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. The plant features lanceolate leaves with a silver-blue hue on the underside, which distinguishes it from other gentian species. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
