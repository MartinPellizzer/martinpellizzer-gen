    "intro": "Gouldia sandwicensis var. arborescens, commonly known as the Hawaiian tree fern, is a distinctive plant native to the tropical regions of Hawaii. It belongs to the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in coastal and lowland forests. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens. However, it is sensitive to cold temperatures and requires careful cultivation to thrive outside its native habitat."
