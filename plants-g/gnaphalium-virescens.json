    "intro": "Gnaphalium virescens, commonly known as green cudweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with numerous small, clustered stems. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear, hairy, and often covered with glandular dots that secrete a sticky substance. Gnaphalium virescens is commonly found in dry meadows, rocky soils, and disturbed areas, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
