    "intro": "Geranium robertianum var. maritimum, commonly known as sea geranium, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in maritime environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically rounded and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
