    "intro": "Genista gasparrinii, commonly known as the Gasparrini's broom, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by narrow, needle-like leaves. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in open woodland or scrubland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
