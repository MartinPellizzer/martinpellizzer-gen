    "intro": "Gaultheria rupicola, commonly known as the rock cranberry, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and heathers. The plant is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruits, which are red berries, are edible and have a tart, cranberry-like flavor. Gaultheria rupicola thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats."
