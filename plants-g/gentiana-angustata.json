    "intro": "Gentiana angustata, commonly known as the narrowleaf gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which are typically tubular and arranged in a dense, spike-like cluster. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Gentiana angustata is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
