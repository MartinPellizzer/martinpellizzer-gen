    "intro": "Gentiana stellulata var. dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, glaucous leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer. The flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters and have five petals, with a prominent central spur. This variant is distinguished by its dichotomous branching pattern, which is less common in other gentian species. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
