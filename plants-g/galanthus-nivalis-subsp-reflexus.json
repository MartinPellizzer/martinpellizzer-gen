    "intro": "Galanthus nivalis subsp. reflexus, commonly known as the reflexed snowdrop, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive white, reflexed (bent backward) flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and shaded rock crevices, preferring moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a bulbous root system. The subspecies is closely related to the common snowdrop, Galanthus nivalis, but differs in the shape of its petals and flowering behavior."
