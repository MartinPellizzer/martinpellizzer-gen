    "intro": "Gastrochilus klossii, commonly known as the Kloss's toothed orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, toothed lip and delicate floral structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its flowers, which are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, are small but striking, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Gastrochilus klossii is considered a threatened species in its native range."
