    "intro": "Geum montanum f. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf mountain avens, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh mountain environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
