    "intro": "Gonolobus rhamnifolius, commonly known as the creeping wisteria, is a perennial vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are usually smooth and dark green, with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, blooming in the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and can spread extensively, making it an aggressive weed in certain environments. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as along stream banks and in forest understories."
