    "intro": "Gagea procera, commonly known as the tall gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands or meadows. It produces small, round bulbs that serve as its primary means of reproduction and storage. Gagea procera is often found in elevations ranging from 1,000 to 4,000 meters and is adapted to temperate climates."
