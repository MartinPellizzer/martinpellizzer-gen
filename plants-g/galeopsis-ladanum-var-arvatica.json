    "intro": "Galeopsis ladanum var. arvatica, commonly known as narrow-leaved hedge-nettle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Its fibrous roots and rapid growth make it a common pioneer species in ecological succession."
