    "intro": "Genista desoleana subsp. desoleana, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its botanical features make it both a hardy ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
