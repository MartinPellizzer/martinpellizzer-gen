    "intro": "Gaura gracilis, commonly known as whorled gaura, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a delicate, airy appearance. Gaura gracilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
