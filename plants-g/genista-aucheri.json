    "intro": "Genista aucheri, commonly known as the Algerian broom, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in racemes during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and feather-like, contributing to its delicate appearance. Genista aucheri is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
