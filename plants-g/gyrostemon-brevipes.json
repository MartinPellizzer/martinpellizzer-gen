    "intro": "Gyrostemon brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed gyrostemon, is a small shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, round, berry-like fruits. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
