    "intro": "Goniophlebium ligustrifolium, commonly known as the three-leaved fern, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of East Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and other related plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of the Ligustrum genus, hence its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in early spring, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
