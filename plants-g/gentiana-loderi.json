    "intro": "Gentiana loderi, commonly known as the Loder's gentian, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Gentiana loderi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, showy blooms."
