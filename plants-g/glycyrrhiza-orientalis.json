    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza orientalis, commonly known as licorice, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Glycyrrhiza orientalis is valued for its roots, which are rich in glycyrrhizin, a compound used in traditional medicine and as a sweetener. Its growth habit and botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and commercial contexts."
