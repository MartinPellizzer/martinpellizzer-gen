    "intro": "Galium trifidum subsp. typicum, commonly known as three-lobed bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, often prostrate stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three distinct lobes, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
