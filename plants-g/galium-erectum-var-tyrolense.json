    "intro": "Galium erectum var. tyrolense, commonly known as Tyrolean bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its presence is often an indicator of undisturbed, nutrient-rich soils in mountainous areas."
