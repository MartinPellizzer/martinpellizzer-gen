    "intro": "Geranium wlassovianum var. maximowiczii, commonly known as the Siberian geranium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that are often hairy, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are serrated along the edges. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
