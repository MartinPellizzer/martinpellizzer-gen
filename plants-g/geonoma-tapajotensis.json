    "intro": "Geonoma tapajotensis, commonly known as the Tapaj\u00f3s fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the rainforests of South America, particularly in the Amazon basin. The plant is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in the undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
