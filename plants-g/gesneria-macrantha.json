    "intro": "Gesneria macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered gesneria, is a striking tropical plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green elliptical leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, with a prominent white throat, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria macrantha is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
