It is native to the humid forests of Central and South America, particularly in regions with high rainfall and warm climates. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on the upper surface. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, and it produces edible, fleshy berries that are often consumed by various wildlife species.
