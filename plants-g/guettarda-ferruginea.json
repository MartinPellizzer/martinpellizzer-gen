    "intro": "Guettarda ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty guettarda, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is well adapted to saline and sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a leathery texture with a reddish-brown underside. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
