    "intro": "Galium ciliare, commonly known as silky bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, often prostrate stems that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and have a delicate, hairy texture. Galium ciliare thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
