    "intro": "Gomphocarpus trachyphyllus, commonly known as the yellow starbursts, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release the seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
