    "intro": "Gonocarpus serpyllifolius, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and thrives in well-drained, saline soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in coastal environments. Gonocarpus serpyllifolius is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive appearance and hardiness."
