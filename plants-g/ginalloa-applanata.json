    "intro": "Ginalloa applanata, commonly known as the flat-leaf ginalloa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. Ginalloa applanata thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
