    "intro": "Grindelia subdecurrens, commonly known as the narrowleaf gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads. Grindelia subdecurrens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native pollinators."
