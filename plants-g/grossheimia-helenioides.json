    "intro": "Grossheimia helenioides, commonly known as the Helen's heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Due to its hardiness and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
