    "intro": "Genista stylosa, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that produces yellow, pea-like flowers in early spring. The plant has slender, woody stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are small, evergreen, and trifoliate, while its seeds are enclosed in pods. Genista stylosa is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
