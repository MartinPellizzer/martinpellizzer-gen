It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis ligulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
