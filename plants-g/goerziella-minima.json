    "intro": "Goerziella minima, commonly known as the dwarf goerziella, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a short, horizontal rhizome with several erect, slender stems that bear small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are usually arranged in a loose cluster. Due to its delicate nature and limited distribution, Goerziella minima is considered a rare and specialized species within the orchid family."
