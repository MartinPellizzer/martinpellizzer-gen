    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza echinata var. subinermis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved licorice, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, followed by pods that contain several seeds. It is valued for its roots, which are rich in glycyrrhizin and have been used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other Glycyrrhiza species."
