    "intro": "Guzmania michelii, commonly known as the rainbow plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble a crown, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a central rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small pool that supports a miniature ecosystem. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in the center, emerging from the leaf axils. Guzmania michelii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil for optimal growth."
