    "intro": "Geranium radicatum var. villosum, commonly known as the hairy geranium, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for anchoring in rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes, where it thrives in full sun."
