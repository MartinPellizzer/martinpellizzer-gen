    "intro": "Galanthus nivalis var. stenopetalus, commonly known as the narrow-petaled snowdrop, is a variant of the snowdrop genus characterized by its distinctive, narrow petals. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe, where it thrives in woodland and rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white flowers with a yellow-green spathe, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are grass-like and emerge before the flowers, contributing to its early spring display. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, frost-resistant blooms."
