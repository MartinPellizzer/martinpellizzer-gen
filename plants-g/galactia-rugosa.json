    "intro": "Galactia rugosa, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Galactia rugosa is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates."
