    "intro": "Grammitis punctata, commonly known as the spotted huperzia, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often adorned with small, raised dots or spots. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are released from the underside of the leaves, which are covered in a thin, membranous layer. Grammitis punctata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique foliage."
