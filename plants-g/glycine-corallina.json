    "intro": "Glycine corallina, commonly known as coralbean, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive coral-colored, bean-like pods that contain toxic seeds. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Glycine corallina typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often along dry streambeds and rocky soils. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, although caution is advised due to the toxicity of its seeds."
