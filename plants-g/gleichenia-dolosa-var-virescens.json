    "intro": "Gleichenia dolosa var. virescens, commonly known as the green Gleichenia, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, strap-like fronds that are typically bright green and somewhat leathery in texture. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
