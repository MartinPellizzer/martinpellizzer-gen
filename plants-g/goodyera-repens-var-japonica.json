    "intro": "Goodyera repens var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese basket plant, is a low-growing epiphytic orchid native to East Asia. It features delicate, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that form a dense mat on the forest floor or on tree trunks. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form colonies in its natural habitat."
