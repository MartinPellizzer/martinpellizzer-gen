    "intro": "Goodenia heteromera var. deminuta, commonly known as the slender goodenia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. The plant typically grows from a compact, woody base and is well adapted to drought conditions. It is often found in sandy soils and is a component of the local flora in areas with limited rainfall. This variant is distinguished by its smaller size and more delicate appearance compared to the typical form of Goodenia heteromera."
