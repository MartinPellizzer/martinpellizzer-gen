    "intro": "Gaultheria abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and parts of Canada. It features small, dark green leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year, and it produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring. The plant is notable for its aromatic leaves, which contain methyl salicylate, giving it a wintergreen scent. Gaultheria abbreviata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
