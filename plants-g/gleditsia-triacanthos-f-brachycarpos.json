    "intro": "Gleditsia triacanthos f. brachycarpos, commonly known as the Bur River locust, is a fast-growing, drought-tolerant tree native to the central and southeastern United States. It has a thick, fissured bark and compound leaves that are typically shorter and more densely arranged compared to the typical form. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous clusters, which are followed by long, slender seed pods. It is often used in urban landscaping due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in certain areas if not properly managed."
