    "intro": "Garcinia acuticosta, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed garcinia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright orange or red berries that are edible. Garcinia acuticosta thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and potential medicinal applications."
