    "intro": "Gentiana selaginifolia, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically basal, arranged in a rosette, and are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Gentiana selaginifolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
