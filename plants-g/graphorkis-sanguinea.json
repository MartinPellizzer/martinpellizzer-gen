    "intro": "Graphorkis sanguinea, commonly known as the bloodroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features a distinctive red-orange sap that oozes from its rhizome when damaged, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, stout stem with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its showy, white flowers bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the base of the leaves. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
