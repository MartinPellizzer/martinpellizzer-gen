    "intro": "Gonioma malagasy, commonly known as the Madagascar horned orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like floral structures that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in the dry, arid regions of the island. Its flowers are usually small and pale, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
