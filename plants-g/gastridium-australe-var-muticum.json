It is characterized by its blue to violet flower heads and silver-green foliage, which are adapted to withstand saline and windy conditions. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, thriving in full sun. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
