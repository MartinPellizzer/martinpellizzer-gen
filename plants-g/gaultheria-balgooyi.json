    "intro": "Gaultheria balgooyi, commonly known as the Andean wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. Gaultheria balgooyi thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests and cloud forests. Its aromatic leaves contain compounds similar to those found in wintergreen, giving it a distinct minty scent."
