    "intro": "Galium cinereum, commonly known as silverweed or pale bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, often hairy stems that lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, silvery hairs. Its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Galium cinereum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
