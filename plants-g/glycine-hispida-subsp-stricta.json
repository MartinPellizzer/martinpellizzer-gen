    "intro": "Glycine hispida subsp. stricta, commonly known as the hairy soybean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soils and is often used in agricultural systems for soil enrichment. Glycine hispida subsp. stricta is also valued for its potential in sustainable farming practices due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
