    "intro": "Galium boreale var. glabrum, commonly known as northern bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as tundra, wet meadows, and stream banks. The plant has slender, ascending stems that are often hairless, as indicated by its variety name \"glabrum.\" Its small, white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native environments."
