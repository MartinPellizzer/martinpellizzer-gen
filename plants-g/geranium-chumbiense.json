    "intro": "Geranium chumbiense, commonly known as the Chumbi geranium, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of five-petaled blooms in shades of pink, red, or white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. Geranium chumbiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
