It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs. Galium humifusum var. diffusum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
