It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its showy, clustered pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often in sandy or rocky soils. It has slender, branching stems and small, linear leaves that help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
