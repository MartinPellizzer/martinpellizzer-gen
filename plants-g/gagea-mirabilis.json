    "intro": "Gagea mirabilis, commonly known as the star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and delicate, star-shaped white flowers. The plant produces a single, upward-facing bloom that typically appears in early spring. Its bulbs are relatively small and store nutrients to support growth during dormancy. Gagea mirabilis is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
