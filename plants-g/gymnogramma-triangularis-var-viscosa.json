    "intro": "Gymnogramma triangularis var. viscosa, commonly known as the sticky gymnogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, triangular-shaped fronds that are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are released from specialized structures called sporangia. This variety is distinguished by its viscid (sticky) texture, which is a key feature in its identification."
