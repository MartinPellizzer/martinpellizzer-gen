    "intro": "Galium umbellulatum, commonly known as white bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval to lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Galium umbellulatum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
