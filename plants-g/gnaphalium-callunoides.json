    "intro": "Gnaphalium callunoides, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. Its aromatic leaves and flowers make it a valuable plant for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
