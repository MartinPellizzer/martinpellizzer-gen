    "intro": "Gomphocarpus alatus, commonly known as the milkweed tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stem and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking orange or yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Gomphocarpus alatus is often found in woodland and grassland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils."
