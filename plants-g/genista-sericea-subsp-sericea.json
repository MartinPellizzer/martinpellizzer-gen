    "intro": "Genista sericea subsp. sericea, commonly known as silverbush, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
