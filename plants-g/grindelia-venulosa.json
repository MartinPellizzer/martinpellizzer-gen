    "intro": "Grindelia venulosa, commonly known as desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Grindelia venulosa is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
