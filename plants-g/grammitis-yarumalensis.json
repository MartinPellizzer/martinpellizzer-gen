    "intro": "Grammitis yarumalensis, commonly known as the Yarumal fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in cloud forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of the leaves. Grammitis yarumalensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
