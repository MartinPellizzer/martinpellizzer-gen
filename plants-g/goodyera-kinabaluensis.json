    "intro": "Goodyera kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Bornean waxplant, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the high elevations of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, reflective coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in loose inflorescences, typical of the orchid family. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
