    "intro": "Glycine triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed sweet pea, is a climbing legume native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant is characterized by its twining stems and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Glycine triloba has compound, pinnately arranged leaves and is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. It is a valuable plant for ecological restoration due to its adaptability and ornamental value."
