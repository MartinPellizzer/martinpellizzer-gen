    "intro": "Gladiolus aladagensis, commonly known as the Adagansis gladiolus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing vibrant, spurred petals in shades of red, pink, and white. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it thrives in well-drained, fertile soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
