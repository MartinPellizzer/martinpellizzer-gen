    "intro": "Gomphopetalum, commonly known as the everlastings, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cistaceae. These plants are native to South Africa and are characterized by their compact, mat-forming growth habit. They produce small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often blooming throughout the year. The leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Gomphopetalum species are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
