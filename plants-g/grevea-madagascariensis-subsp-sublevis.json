    "intro": "Grevea madagascariensis subsp. sublevis, commonly known as the Madagascar grevea, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and showy, five-petaled flowers. The subspecies sublevis is distinguished by its relatively smooth, leathery leaves and smaller, more rounded petals compared to other subspecies. It typically grows in humid, lowland forest environments, where it thrives in the warm and moist climate. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
