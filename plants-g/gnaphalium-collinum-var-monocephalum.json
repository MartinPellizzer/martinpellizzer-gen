    "intro": "Gnaphalium collinum var. monocephalum, commonly known as the single-headed cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern regions of the United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils, and it is often found in disturbed areas. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, while the flower heads are small and typically yellow or white. The plant produces tiny seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
