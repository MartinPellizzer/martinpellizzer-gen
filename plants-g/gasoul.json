    "intro": "Gasoul, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in a range of colors from white to deep pink. The plant has a unique ability to purify water and is often found in ponds and slow-moving rivers. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment. Gasoul holds cultural and spiritual significance in many Asian countries, symbolizing purity and enlightenment."
