    "intro": "Gymnogramma valleculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of fine, hairy structures, which aid in water retention. Gymnogramma valleculata is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices, making it an interesting subject for botanical study in humid climates."
