    "intro": "Grammitis multicaudata, commonly known as the long-tailed moss fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has slender, wiry fronds with a distinctive elongated, tapering shape. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Grammitis multicaudata is often found in rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
