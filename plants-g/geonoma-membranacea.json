    "intro": "Geonoma membranacea, commonly known as the membranous geonoma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. This plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that form a central cup, which collects water. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, and the plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers. It is often found in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
