    "intro": "Gale portugalensis, commonly known as the Portuguese gale, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Azores. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered umbels of white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, where it has adapted to the harsh maritime climate. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional herbal remedies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
