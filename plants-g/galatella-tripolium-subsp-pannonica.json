    "intro": "Galatella tripolium subsp. pannonica, commonly known as the Pannonian galatella, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptability and limited distribution."
