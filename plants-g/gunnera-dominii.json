    "intro": "Gunnera dominii, commonly known as the Andean giant water shield, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter. The plant thrives in wet, boggy environments and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to retain moisture and protect against strong winds. Gunnera dominii is also notable for its clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring."
