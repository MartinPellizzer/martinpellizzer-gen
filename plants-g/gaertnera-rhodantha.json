    "intro": "Gaertnera rhodantha, commonly known as the red-flowered guam plant, is a flowering plant native to the island of Guam in the western Pacific. It is a small shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, pink to red flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often growing in sandy or limestone soils. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
