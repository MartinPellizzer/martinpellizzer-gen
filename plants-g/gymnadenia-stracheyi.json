    "intro": "Gymnadenia stracheyi, commonly known as the Strachey's grass-pink, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Gymnadenia stracheyi is a rare and endangered species in many regions, making it a subject of conservation interest."
