    "intro": "Gagea pusilla var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and mountain meadows. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in rocky or disturbed soils, and it is often found in association with other woodland flora. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
