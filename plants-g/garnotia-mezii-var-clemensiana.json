    "intro": "Garnotia mezii var. clemensiana, commonly known as the Clemens' garnotia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and purple. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It is often found in shaded to semi-shaded habitats within forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
