    "intro": "Gymnocalycium jochumii, commonly known as the Jochum's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Argentina. It is characterized by its globular, ribbed stem that typically measures between 5 and 15 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. Its leaves are ephemeral, appearing only during the rainy season before shedding to reduce water loss. Gymnocalycium jochumii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
