It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in summer. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture with serrated edges. Grewia polygama thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
