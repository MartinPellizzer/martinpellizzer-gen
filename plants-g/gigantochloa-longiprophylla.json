It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant has long, narrow leaves with a smooth surface and a prominent midrib. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in wetlands and lowland areas. Due to its rapid growth and structural strength, it is sometimes used in construction and as a source of fiber."
