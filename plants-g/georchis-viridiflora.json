    "intro": "Georchis viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is notable for its unique floral structure and is often found in moist, shaded habitats."
