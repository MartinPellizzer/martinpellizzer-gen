    "intro": "Gnaphalium spicatum var. sabulosum, commonly known as sand everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has fibrous roots and succulent, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is well adapted to dry, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in dunes or coastal grasslands. Its aromatic foliage and long-lasting flowers make it a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control."
