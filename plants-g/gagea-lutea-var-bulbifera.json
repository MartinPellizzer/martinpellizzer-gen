It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of delicate, yellowish-white flowers in early spring. The plant's most distinctive characteristic is its ability to form small, edible bulbs underground, which are used in traditional cuisine. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is often cultivated in gardens and herbal practices."
