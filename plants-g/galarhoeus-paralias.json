    "intro": "Galarhoeus paralias, commonly known as the coastal spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal areas. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are usually fleshy and covered in a waxy coating, helping to retain moisture in arid environments. Galarhoeus paralias is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species found along shorelines."
