    "intro": "Geranium oreades, commonly known as the mountain geranium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are typically lobed or deeply toothed. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Geranium oreades is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a wildflower in native plant landscapes."
