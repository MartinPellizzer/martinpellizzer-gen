    "intro": "Ginseng quinquefolium, commonly known as American ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the forests of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive five-lobed leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces red berries that contain the seeds, and its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine. American ginseng is valued for its adaptogenic properties and is often cultivated for its medicinal benefits. It thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade."
