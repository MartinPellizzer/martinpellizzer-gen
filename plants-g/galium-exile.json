    "intro": "Galium exile, commonly known as slender bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often hairy and can become woody with age, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Galium exile is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
