    "intro": "Gaultheria procumbens f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated wintergreen, is a variant of the wintergreen plant native to eastern North America. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub with dark green, elliptical leaves that are slightly elongated compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries contain aromatic oils and are used in traditional herbal remedies. The elongated leaves and compact growth habit make it a distinctive and ornamental species within the Ericaceae family."
