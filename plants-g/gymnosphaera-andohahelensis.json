    "intro": "Gymnosphaera andohahelensis, commonly known as the Andohahela gymnosperm, is a rare and unique plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the order Gnetales, which is a small group of gymnosperms that are often considered transitional between conifers and angiosperms. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, woody structure and produces small, scale-like leaves. Gymnosphaera andohahelensis is notable for its limited distribution and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited study, it remains a poorly understood species within the botanical community."
