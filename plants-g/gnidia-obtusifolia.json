    "intro": "Gnidia obtusifolia, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, bead-like fruits. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Gnidia obtusifolia is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine."
