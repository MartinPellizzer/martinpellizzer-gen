    "intro": "Grammitis satyros, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a fern's traditional structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of silvery hair, which helps reflect excess light and retain moisture. Grammitis satyros is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
