    "intro": "Gossypium hirsutum subsp. mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican cotton plant, is a wild species native to Central America and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy stems, which are typical features of the genus Gossypium. The plant produces small, green capsules that contain fibrous seeds, and its flowers are usually pink or white. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in such conditions. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to cultivated cotton varieties."
