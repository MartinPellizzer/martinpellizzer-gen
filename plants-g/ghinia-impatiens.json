    "intro": "Ghinia impatiens, commonly known as the touch-me-not or impatiens, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in a wide range of colors, including red, pink, white, and purple. The plant typically grows as an annual, reaching heights of 1 to 3 feet, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in partial to full shade and is popular in gardens for its ability to bloom continuously throughout the growing season. The seed pods, which burst open when mature, are a unique feature that aids in seed dispersal."
