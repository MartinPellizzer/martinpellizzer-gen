    "intro": "Genlisea aurea var. aurea, commonly known as the golden bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetlands in South America. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves that form specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. These bladders are highly sensitive and can rapidly inflate to capture tiny aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor water environments, relying on its unique trapping mechanism for essential nutrients. Its delicate appearance and specialized adaptations make it a fascinating subject in the study of carnivorous flora."
