    "intro": "Glechoma hederacea brevipetiolatum, commonly known as the creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a desirable ground cover and a potential weed in cultivated gardens."
