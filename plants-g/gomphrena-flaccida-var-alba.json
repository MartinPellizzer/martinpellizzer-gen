It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces bract-like leaves that are often mistaken for flowers, giving it a unique appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The plant is also known for its long-lasting flowers, which remain intact even when dried, hence its common name."
