It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several seeds. Galium pyrenaicum is often found in rocky or wooded areas and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
