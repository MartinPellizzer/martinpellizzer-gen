It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Galium valdivianum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
