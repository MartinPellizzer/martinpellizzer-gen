    "intro": "Gothofreda macroglossa, commonly known as the giant lip orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble lips, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, and it produces a strong, sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in both horticulture and conservation efforts."
