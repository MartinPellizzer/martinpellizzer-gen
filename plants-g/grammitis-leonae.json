    "intro": "Grammitis leonae, commonly known as the Leon's spikemoss, is a member of the family Huperjaniaceae and is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It produces sporangia on specialized structures called sporophylls, which are arranged in clusters along the stems. Grammitis leonae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
