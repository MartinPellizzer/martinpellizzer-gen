    "intro": "Glandularia mendocina, commonly known as the Mendocino glandularia, is a flowering plant native to California. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and chaparral. Its glandular surfaces produce sticky secretions, which may deter herbivores and aid in water retention. Glandularia mendocina is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates."
