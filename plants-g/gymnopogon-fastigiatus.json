It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
