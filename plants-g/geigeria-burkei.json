    "intro": "Geigeria burkei, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. Geigeria burkei is known for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used for tool handles and other small crafts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats."
