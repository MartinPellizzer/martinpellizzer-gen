    "intro": "Grammitis circumvallata, commonly known as the veined shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The fronds are bi-pinnate, with a distinctive, shield-like appearance due to the dense arrangement of pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
