    "intro": "Gleasonia, commonly known as the \"Gleason's mistletoe,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Loranthaceae. It is native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and Mexico. These plants are hemiparasitic, meaning they derive some of their nutrients from host trees while also performing photosynthesis. Gleasonia species typically have small, scale-like leaves and produce small, white or yellowish flowers. They are often found growing on the branches of oak and elm trees, contributing to the ecological dynamics of their forest habitats."
