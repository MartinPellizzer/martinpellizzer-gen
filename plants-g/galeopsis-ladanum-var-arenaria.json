    "intro": "Galeopsis ladanum var. arenaria, commonly known as sand galeopsis, is a perennial herb native to arid and rocky regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, branched stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
