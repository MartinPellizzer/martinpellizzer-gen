    "intro": "Glaucium corniculatum var. tricolor, commonly known as the three-color gloryflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its strikingly colorful flowers that display three distinct hues, typically blue, yellow, and white. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
