    "intro": "Galium gaudichaudii subsp. gaudichaudii, commonly known as the Hawaiian bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from spring to summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in Hawaii."
