    "intro": "Gaylussacia adenochaeta, commonly known as the rough alpine cranberry, is a species of shrub belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian Mountains, where it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and often used in local foraging traditions. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a rough texture, and the stems are covered in short, stiff hairs. This plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food for wildlife and contributing to soil stability."
