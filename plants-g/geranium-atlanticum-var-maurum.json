It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or wildflower meadows. Its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators make it a desirable plant for ecological and garden settings."
