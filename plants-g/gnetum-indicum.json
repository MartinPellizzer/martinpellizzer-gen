    "intro": "Gnetum indicum, commonly known as the Indian gnetum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Gnetaceae. It is a dioecious shrub characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are often leathery and have a distinctive venation pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are either male or female, with separate plants. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, three-lobed capsule, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical regions. Gnetum indicum is also notable for its unique vascular system, which resembles that of angiosperms."
