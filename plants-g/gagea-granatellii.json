    "intro": "Gagea granatellii, commonly known as the granate gagea, is a small, perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces a small, spherical bulb that is often covered in a reddish or purplish tunic, which gives it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
