    "intro": "Gymnogramma ampla, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a unique feature that aids in its survival by deterring herbivores. Gymnogramma ampla is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine."
