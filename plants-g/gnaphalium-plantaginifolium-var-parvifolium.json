    "intro": "Gnaphalium plantaginifolium var. parvifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. The flowers are tiny, clustered in dense heads, and are usually pale yellow or white, with a slightly aromatic scent. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported soothing properties."
