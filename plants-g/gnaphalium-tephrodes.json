    "intro": "Gnaphalium tephrodes, commonly known as the sand everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flower heads that are often mistaken for individual flowers, and it is known for its long-lasting dried flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its foliage emits a mild, pleasant scent, which is attributed to the presence of volatile oils."
