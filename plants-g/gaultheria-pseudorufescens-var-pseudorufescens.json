    "intro": "Gaultheria pseudorufescens var. pseudorufescens, commonly known as the red-flowered wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It typically grows in high-altitude regions, reaching elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. The plant features glossy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink or red. Its berries are edible, though they are generally small and tart. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and floral characteristics."
