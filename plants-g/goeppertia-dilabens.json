It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are broad, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating. The leaves typically display vibrant pink or red hues, especially under bright light conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures called sori. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and low maintenance requirements."
