    "intro": "Geranium dissectum f. subintegrilobatum, commonly known as the dissected geranium, is a botanical variant characterized by its finely lobed leaves. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical species, with leaves that are less deeply divided. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for garden borders or containers. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and vibrant floral display."
