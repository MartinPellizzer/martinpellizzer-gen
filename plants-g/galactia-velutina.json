    "intro": "Galactia velutina, commonly known as the velvet milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Galactia velutina is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Its growth habit and morphological features make it a distinctive member of the Fabaceae family."
