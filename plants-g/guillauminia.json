    "intro": "Guillauminia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Guillauminia species are typically small shrubs with hairy foliage and tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. These plants are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to bloom throughout the year under suitable conditions."
