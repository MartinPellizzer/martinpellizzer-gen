    "intro": "Gagea novoascanica, commonly known as the Nuevo Le\u00f3n gagea, is a small, perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of northeastern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of delicate, bell-shaped white flowers. The plant produces underground bulbs that store nutrients, allowing it to survive in its arid or semi-arid habitat. It is typically found in rocky soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
