The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its delicate foliage and compact growth habit, it is often used in ground cover or as a filler plant in mixed borders."
