    "intro": "Galeopsis nodosa var. praecox, commonly known as early hedge-nettle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in fields, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant features opposite, hairy leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes. Its seeds are enclosed in small, dry fruits called utricles, which aid in wind dispersal. It is often considered a weed but has historical use in traditional medicine."
