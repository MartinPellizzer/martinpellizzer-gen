    "intro": "Gymnosporia buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf spurge, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that resemble those of boxwood. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though care must be taken due to its toxic properties."
