    "intro": "Guzmania condensata, commonly known as the condensed guzmania, is a bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that resembles a pinecone, with vibrant red, orange, and yellow bracts. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from air and rain. Its rosette-shaped leaves are long and narrow, often covered in a waxy layer that helps retain water. Guzmania condensata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
