    "intro": "Gomphocarpus gibbus, commonly known as the spurred gentian, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stem is hairy and often branched. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its ecological role in seed dispersal."
