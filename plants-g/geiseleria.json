It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants typically have grass-like leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that are often green or reddish in color. Geiseleria species are often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
