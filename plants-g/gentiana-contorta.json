    "intro": "Gentiana contorta, commonly known as the bent gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and prefers well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Gentiana contorta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty."
