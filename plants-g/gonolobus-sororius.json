    "intro": "Gonolobus sororius, commonly known as the slender velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain areas."
