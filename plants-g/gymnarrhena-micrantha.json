    "intro": "Gymnarrhena micrantha, commonly known as the small-fruited burr, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, woody pods. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish, and it produces small, rounded fruits that contain several seeds. Gymnarrhena micrantha is often found in scrublands and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
