It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its stems are covered in fine, white hairs, and its leaves are narrow and grayish-green. The flowers bloom in late summer and early fall, producing small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
