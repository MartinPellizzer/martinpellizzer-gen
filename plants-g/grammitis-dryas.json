    "intro": "Grammitis dryas, commonly known as the dryas fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are short and branched, anchoring it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
