    "intro": "Guilandina major, commonly known as the giant hyacinth bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It produces large, showy flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, with a distinctive spurred shape. The plant has compound leaves and bears pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for ornamental use in gardens and as a cover crop. Guilandina major is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility."
