    "intro": "Galactites tomentosus var. caerulea, commonly known as the blue milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are covered in fine white to grayish pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a notable feature of its botanical makeup. This species is often found in dry, rocky or sandy soils in its natural habitat."
