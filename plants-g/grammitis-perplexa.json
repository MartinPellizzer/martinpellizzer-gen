    "intro": "Grammitis perplexa, commonly known as the perplexing moss-fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis perplexa is notable for its intricate leaf structure and is often found in rainforest ecosystems."
