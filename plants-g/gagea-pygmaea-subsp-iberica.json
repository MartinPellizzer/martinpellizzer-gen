    "intro": "Gagea pygmaea subsp. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian gagea, is a small, bulbous perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
