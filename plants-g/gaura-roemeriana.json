    "intro": "Gaura roemeriana, commonly known as Roemer's gaura, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and thrives in full sun. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Gaura roemeriana is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide ecological benefits."
