    "intro": "Galium microphyllum, commonly known as littleleaf bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its slender stems and delicate appearance make it a characteristic component of understory vegetation in its native habitat."
