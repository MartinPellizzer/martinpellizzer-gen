    "intro": "Gomesa psyche, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale greenish-white flowers and unique, slender, leafless stems. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees in wet, shaded forest environments. It has a complex root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from its surroundings. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
