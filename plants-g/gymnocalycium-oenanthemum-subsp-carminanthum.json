    "intro": "Gymnocalycium oenanthemum subsp. carminanthum, commonly known as the Crimson Moon Cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of pink and red, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. This subspecies is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
