    "intro": "Goniopteris moranii, commonly known as the Moran's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, serrated pinnae that contribute to its intricate appearance. Goniopteris moranii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
