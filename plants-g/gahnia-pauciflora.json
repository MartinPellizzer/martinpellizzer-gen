    "intro": "Gahnia pauciflora, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically less than 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in wetland and swampy environments, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Gahnia pauciflora is an important component of the vegetation in coastal and inland wetlands across eastern and southern Australia."
