    "intro": "Geranium pinnatum, commonly known as the pinnate geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, pinnately lobed leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from spring to autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
