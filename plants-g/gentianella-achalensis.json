    "intro": "Gentianella achalensis, commonly known as the Achal highland gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Western Ghats in India. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous areas with cool climates. Its flowers are characterized by their striking blue color and five petals, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Gentianella achalensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
