    "intro": "Gnaphalium athrixiifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cudweed, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to South America and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and often have a woolly texture, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
