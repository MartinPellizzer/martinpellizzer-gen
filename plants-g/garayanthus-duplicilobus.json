    "intro": "Garayanthus duplicilobus, commonly known as the double-lobed garayanthus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Garayanthus duplicilobus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun exposure."
