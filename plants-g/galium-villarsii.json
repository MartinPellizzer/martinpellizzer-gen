    "intro": "Galium villarsii, commonly known as the alpine bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are opposite, simple, and often hairy. Galium villarsii is characterized by its creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. It is generally a hardy species adapted to cold climates and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
