It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often curled when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Grammitis heteromorpha is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, showcasing its adaptability to humid climates."
