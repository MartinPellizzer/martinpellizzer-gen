    "intro": "Glandularia amoena, commonly known as the pretty glandular verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name and help in reducing water loss. Its flowers, typically in shades of pink or purple, bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Glandularia amoena is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
