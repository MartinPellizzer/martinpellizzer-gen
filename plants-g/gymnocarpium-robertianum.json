It is characterized by its basal leaves that are pinnately lobed and its small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces smooth, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and rocky areas. Gymnocarpium robertianum is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and soil stability."
