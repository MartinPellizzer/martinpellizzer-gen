    "intro": "Gnaphalium sylvaticum subsp. norvegicum, commonly known as the Norwegian cudweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges or meadows. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its widespread distribution across northern Europe. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to the main species."
