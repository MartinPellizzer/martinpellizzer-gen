    "intro": "Gymnogramma scandens, commonly known as the climbing button fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, wiry stems that allow it to climb and trail along surfaces. The plant produces small, round, spore-bearing fronds that are typically less than an inch in diameter. Its leaves are pinnate, with a feathery appearance, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Gymnogramma scandens is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
