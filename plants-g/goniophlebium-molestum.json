    "intro": "Goniophlebium molestum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with rough, textured stems and densely packed leaves. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its growth is often influenced by humidity and light conditions. Goniophlebium molestum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
