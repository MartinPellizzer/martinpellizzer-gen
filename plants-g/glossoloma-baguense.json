    "intro": "Glossoloma baguense, commonly known as the Bagoan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and unique, ghost-like flowers that bloom in a striking shade of white. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers are small and delicate, often appearing in clusters, and it is known for its elusive and rare occurrence in the wild. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Glossoloma baguense is considered critically endangered."
