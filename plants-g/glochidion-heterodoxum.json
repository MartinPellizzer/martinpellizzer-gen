    "intro": "Glochidion heterodoxum, commonly known as the broad-leafed glochidion, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release minute seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Glochidion heterodoxum is often found in moist, shaded environments within lowland forests."
