It typically features slender stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to wetland and riparian habitats."
