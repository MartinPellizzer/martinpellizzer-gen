    "intro": "Gaillonia incana, commonly known as the silverleaf hibiscus, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from a dense layer of fine hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming during the warmer months. Gaillonia incana thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
