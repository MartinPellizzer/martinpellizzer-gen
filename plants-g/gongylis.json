    "intro": "Gongylis, commonly known as the \"spurge\" or \"gongyloid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation. Gongylis species are typically herbaceous, with simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. They are often found in moist or wet environments, such as marshes and stream banks. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
