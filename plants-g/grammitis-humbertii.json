    "intro": "Grammitis humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically arranged in dense, overlapping whorls. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests where high humidity supports its growth. Its spore-producing structures, known as sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, a feature common among many ferns. Grammitis humbertii plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
