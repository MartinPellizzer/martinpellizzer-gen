    "intro": "Gongronemopsis tenacissima, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical vine belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its climbing habit and elongated, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the undersides of the leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and ability to climb, it is both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
