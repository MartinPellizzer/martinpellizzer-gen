    "intro": "Grammitis trachycarpa, commonly known as the rough-fruit grammitis, is a fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its hardy nature."
