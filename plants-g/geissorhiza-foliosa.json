It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces dense clusters of narrow, strap-shaped leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas.
