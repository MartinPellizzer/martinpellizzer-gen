It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, tuberous roots that help it survive in various soil conditions. Gymnadenia conica is often found in calcareous soils and is considered a valuable plant for biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
