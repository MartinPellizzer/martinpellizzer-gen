    "intro": "Grammitis mneme, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a fern's typical structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which gives it its common name. Grammitis mneme is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
