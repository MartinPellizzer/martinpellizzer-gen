    "intro": "Gymnogramma triangulata, commonly known as the three-lobed spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate (three-lobed) fronds. The plant's leaves are typically divided into three distinct segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. Gymnogramma triangulata is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
