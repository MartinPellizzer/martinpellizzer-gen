    "intro": "Galinsoga mollis, commonly known as common galinsoga, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in gardens. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a common weed in many regions. Galinsoga mollis has a branched root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds."
