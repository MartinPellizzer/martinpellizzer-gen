It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with woody stems and broad, ovate leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with five petals and stamens that are prominently displayed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
