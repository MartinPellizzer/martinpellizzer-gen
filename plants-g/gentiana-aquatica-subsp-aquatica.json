It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and lake margins. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in many regions."
