    "intro": "Gynotroches, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. These plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that often have a distinctive greenish or reddish hue. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The flowers are usually bisexual, with both stamens and pistils present, facilitating self-pollination. Gynotroches species are often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
