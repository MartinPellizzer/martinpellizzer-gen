    "intro": "Guadua spinosissima, commonly known as the spiny bamboo, is a species of grass belonging to the Poaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador, where it thrives in humid tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and sharp, spiny nodes that give it its common name. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a slight pubescence, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles. Guadua spinosissima is valued for its strong, lightweight bamboo-like material, which is used in construction and handicrafts."
