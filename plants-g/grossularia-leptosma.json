    "intro": "Grossularia leptosma, commonly known as the slender gooseberry, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries that ripen in late summer. These berries are edible and have a tart flavor, making them popular in local cuisines. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
