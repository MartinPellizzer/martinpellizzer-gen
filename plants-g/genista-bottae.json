It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, wiry stems that form a mat-like growth habit, making it suitable for ground cover. Its leaves are small, narrow, and leathery, with a distinctive grayish-green color. Genista bottae is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for rocky or coastal gardens."
