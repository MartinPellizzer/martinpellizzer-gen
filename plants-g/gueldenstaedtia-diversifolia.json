    "intro": "Gueldenstaedtia diversifolia, commonly known as the diverse-leaved gueldenstaedtia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender stems that often sprawl along the ground, and its leaves are alternate, with a variety of shapes that contribute to its common name. The flowers are small and usually white or pale green, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
