    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza subinermis, commonly known as the lesser licorice, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces slender, woody stems and is known for its deep taproot, which can reach several meters in length. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and steppe regions. Glycyrrhiza subinermis is less commercially valuable than its relative, Glycyrrhiza glabra, but it shares similar chemical properties and has been used in traditional medicine."
