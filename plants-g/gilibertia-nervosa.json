    "intro": "Gilibertia nervosa, commonly known as the \"buttercup plant,\" is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that resemble those of the buttercup. The plant has compound leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Gilibertia nervosa is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native habitat."
