    "intro": "Glechoma calaminthodes, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves with scalloped edges and produces small, blue-violet flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spreading habit makes it an effective ground cover, though it can become invasive if not controlled. Botanically, it belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and square stems."
