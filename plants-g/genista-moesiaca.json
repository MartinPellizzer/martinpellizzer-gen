It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is native to southern Europe. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by narrow, needle-like leaves. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for erosion control and ecological restoration."
