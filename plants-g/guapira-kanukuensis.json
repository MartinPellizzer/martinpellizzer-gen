    "intro": "Guapira kanukuensis, commonly known as the Kanuku guapira, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with dark green, oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which bloom in clusters, are often pink or red and attract various pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Guapira kanukuensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
