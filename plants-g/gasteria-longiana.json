It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, with a bluish-green hue and prominent white veins. The plant produces small, pale green flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens.
