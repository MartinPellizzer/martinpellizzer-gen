    "intro": "Glandularia paulensis, commonly known as the Brazilian gorse, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is notable for its glandular hairs, which secrete substances that can deter herbivores. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. Glandularia paulensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
