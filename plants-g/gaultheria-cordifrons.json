    "intro": "Gaultheria cordifrons, commonly known as the red-flowered wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped red flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible and have a sharp, peppery flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in temperate rainforests. Gaultheria cordifrons is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties."
