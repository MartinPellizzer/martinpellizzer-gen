It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are rich in vitamin C and have a tangy flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
