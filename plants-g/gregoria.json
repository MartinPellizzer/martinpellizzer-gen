    "intro": "Gregoria, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Gregoria thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in Mediterranean climates. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
