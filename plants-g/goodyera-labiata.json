    "intro": "Goodyera labiata, commonly known as the pink wax plant, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy, pale green or pinkish coating. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pink, arranged in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Goodyera labiata is often found growing on the forest floor, where it forms dense colonies due to its rhizomatous growth habit."
