    "intro": "Guzmania parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered pineapple plant, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a natural reservoir for its vibrant, spiky inflorescence. Its flowers, which are typically red or orange, bloom in a compact cluster and can last for several months. Guzmania parviflora is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
