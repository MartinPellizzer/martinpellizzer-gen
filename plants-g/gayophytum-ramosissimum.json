    "intro": "Gayophytum ramosissimum, commonly known as the golden torch cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its structure includes spines and areoles, typical features of cacti, which provide protection from herbivores. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
