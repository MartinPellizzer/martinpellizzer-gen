    "intro": "Gentiana exacoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Gentiana exacoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
