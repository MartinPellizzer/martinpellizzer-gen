    "intro": "Gymnostichum hystrix var. majus, commonly known as the coastal spinifex, is a species of grass found in the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, saline soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along the coastline. This variety is closely related to other species within the genus Gymnostichum, which are adapted to harsh, coastal environments."
