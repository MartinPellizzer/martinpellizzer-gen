    "intro": "Gossypium areysianum, commonly known as the Areysian cotton, is a rare and endangered species of cotton native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is characterized by its fibrous seed hairs, which are used for textile production, though it is less commercially significant than other cotton species. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, temperate climates and requires well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, round bolls that contain the cotton fibers. Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, Gossypium areysianum is of interest for conservation and genetic research."
