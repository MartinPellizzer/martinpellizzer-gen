    "intro": "Goniophlebium undulatum, commonly known as the wavy-veined moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are usually lanceolate and have a distinct undulating margin, which gives the plant its common name. It is often found in temperate regions, particularly on rocky substrates or in forest floors. This moss is notable for its resilience and ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions."
