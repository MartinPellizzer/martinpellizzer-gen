    "intro": "Georchis cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and evergreen, and it typically grows on the roots of hardwood trees. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in many states."
