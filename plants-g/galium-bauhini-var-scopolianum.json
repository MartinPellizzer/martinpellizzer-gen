    "intro": "Galium bauhini var. scopolianum, commonly known as the scopolian wood-sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its stolons, which allow it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its woodland habitat, with features that aid in water retention and light absorption."
