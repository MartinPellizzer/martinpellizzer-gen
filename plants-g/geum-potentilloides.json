    "intro": "Geum potentilloides, commonly known as the showy mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal leaves that are palmately lobed and its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, stream banks, and wet meadows. It produces small, achenes as its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, and it is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
