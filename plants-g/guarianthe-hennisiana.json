It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphytic or lithophytic species, meaning it can thrive on other plants or rocks. Its flowers are usually white or pale violet and open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Guarianthe hennisiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses for its unique floral display."
