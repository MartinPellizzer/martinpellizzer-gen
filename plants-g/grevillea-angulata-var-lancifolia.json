    "intro": "Grevillea angulata var. lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waratah, is a striking shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, giving the plant its specific epithet \"lancifolia.\" This variety is closely related to the more well-known Grevillea robusta, but it has a more compact growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens."
