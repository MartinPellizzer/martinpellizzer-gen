    "intro": "Gnaphalium decorum, commonly known as the pretty everlasting plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, showy flower heads. The plant produces fluffy, white to pale yellow florets that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to retain color and form even when dried."
