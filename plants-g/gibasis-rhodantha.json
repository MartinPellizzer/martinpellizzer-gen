    "intro": "Gibasis rhodantha, commonly known as the red-flowered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in gardens across temperate climates."
