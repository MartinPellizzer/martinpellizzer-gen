    "intro": "Guzmania dudleyi, commonly known as the Dudley Guzmania, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in the canopies of trees. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water and nutrients, forming a central pool. Its striking inflorescence consists of vibrant red bracts that surround a cluster of small, white flowers. Guzmania dudleyi thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
