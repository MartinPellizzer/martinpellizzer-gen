    "intro": "Gonema scabrosa, commonly known as the roughleaf gonema, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple and blue, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, often forming dense clumps that provide habitat for small animals. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates."
