    "intro": "Guatteria xanthochlora, commonly known as the yellow-leaf guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Marcaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are typically yellow-green in color, which contribute to its common name. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found growing as an epiphyte on trees. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
