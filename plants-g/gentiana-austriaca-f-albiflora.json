    "intro": "Gentiana austriaca f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered gentian, is a rare and striking variant of the gentian genus native to the Alps. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that contrast sharply with its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and forested areas. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
