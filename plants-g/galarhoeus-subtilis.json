    "intro": "Galarhoeus subtilis, commonly known as the subtle galarhoeus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of pale pink and white. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
