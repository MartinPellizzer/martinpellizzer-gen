    "intro": "Gasteria carinata var. carinata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves with prominent white or yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, tubular, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
