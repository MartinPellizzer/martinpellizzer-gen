    "intro": "Gonolobus stapelioides, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a cluster of small lanterns. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, further minimizing water loss. Gonolobus stapelioides is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
