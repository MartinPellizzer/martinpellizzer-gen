    "intro": "Grammitis pectinata, commonly known as the fringed maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in forested areas. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis pectinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
