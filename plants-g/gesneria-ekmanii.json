    "intro": "Gesneria ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's gesneria, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family, known for its ornamental and often strikingly colored foliage. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad, glossy, and often exhibit a vibrant green color with subtle variegation. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, Gesneria ekmanii is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native range."
