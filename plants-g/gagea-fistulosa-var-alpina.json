    "intro": "Gagea fistulosa var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas at high elevations. It is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
