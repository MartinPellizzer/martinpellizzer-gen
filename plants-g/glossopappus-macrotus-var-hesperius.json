It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are typically visited by a variety of pollinators. Its capsule fruits contain numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun."
