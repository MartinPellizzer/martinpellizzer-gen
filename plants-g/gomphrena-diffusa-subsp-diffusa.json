    "intro": "Gomphrena diffusa subsp. diffusa, commonly known as the common gomphrena, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its striking, papery bracts that range in color from pink to red and purple. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by the showy, leaf-like bracts, which are the primary ornamental feature. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Gomphrena diffusa subsp. diffusa is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
