    "intro": "Gnetum funiculare, commonly known as the climbing gnetum, is a tropical plant belonging to the gymnosperm group. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, simple leaves that are often leathery in texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female structures. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, three-lobed covering, which is a unique feature among gymnosperms. Gnetum funiculare is typically found in humid, shaded environments in tropical regions."
