    "intro": "Gleditsia xylocarpa, commonly known as the honey locust, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to small, thorn-like structures in mature trees. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in pendulous clusters, followed by flat, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often used in reforestation projects. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
