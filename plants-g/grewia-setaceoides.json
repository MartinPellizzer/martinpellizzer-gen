It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds."
