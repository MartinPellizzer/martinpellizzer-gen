    "intro": "Grammitis affinis, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
