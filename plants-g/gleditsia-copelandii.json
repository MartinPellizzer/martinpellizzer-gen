It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into small, oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, green pods that contain flattened seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It has a shallow root system and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to various soil types. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and the ability to thrive in urban environments."
