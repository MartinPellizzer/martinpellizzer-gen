    "intro": "Glossocarya hemiderma, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and dispersed by wind. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
