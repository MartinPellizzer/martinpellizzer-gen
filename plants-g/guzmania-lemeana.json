    "intro": "Guzmania lemeana, commonly known as the Lemeana bromeliad, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that resembles a flower. The plant features a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small aquatic life. Its roots are primarily for anchoring rather than nutrient absorption, as it is an epiphyte. Guzmania lemeana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil."
