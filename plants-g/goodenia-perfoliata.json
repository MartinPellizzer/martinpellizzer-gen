    "intro": "Goodenia perfoliata, commonly known as the perfoliate goodenia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, terminal spike, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are distinctive for their perfoliate base, where the leaf stalks appear to pass through the stem, creating a unique appearance. Goodenia perfoliata is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
