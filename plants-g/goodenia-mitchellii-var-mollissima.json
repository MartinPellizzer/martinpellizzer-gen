It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
