    "intro": "Gastrochilus obtusifolius, commonly known as the blunt-leafed orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white with a slight pink or purple tinge. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
