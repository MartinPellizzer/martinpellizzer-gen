    "intro": "Glycosmis mauritiana var. tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy mastic tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that cover the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, orange-colored fruits. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture due to the presence of the glandular trichomes. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, well-drained soils."
