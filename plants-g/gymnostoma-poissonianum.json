    "intro": "Gymnostoma poissonianum, commonly known as the Poisson's gymnostoma, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters with soft, muddy substrates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often submerged, and it reproduces primarily through rhizome propagation. Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
