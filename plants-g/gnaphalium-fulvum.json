It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. Its yellowish to reddish flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Gnaphalium fulvum is known for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
