    "intro": "Ginkgo macrophylla, commonly known as the Chinese emerald ginkgo, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fan-shaped leaves, which are broad and have a smooth, glossy surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by unique, round, lemon-scented fruits. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Ginkgo macrophylla is highly ornamental and often cultivated for its aesthetic value and air-purifying qualities."
