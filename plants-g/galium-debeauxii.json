It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Galium debeauxii is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
