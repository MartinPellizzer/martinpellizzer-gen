    "intro": "Gnaphalium indutum subsp. indutum, commonly known as the woolly everlasting, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly silver-gray foliage and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its fibrous roots and compact growth habit make it drought-tolerant and well-suited to arid environments. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive, long-lasting flowers."
