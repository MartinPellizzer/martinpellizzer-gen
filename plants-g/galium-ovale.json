    "intro": "Galium ovale, commonly known as common bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its fruits are small, three-lobed berries that mature to a reddish color. Galium ovale is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in woodland edges, where it thrives in moist, partial shade conditions."
