    "intro": "Guapeba semecarpifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian wax tree, is a woody plant native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often dry habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fleshy, red berries. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in arid conditions. Guapeba semecarpifolia plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability."
