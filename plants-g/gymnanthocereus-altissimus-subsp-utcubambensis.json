    "intro": "Gymnanthocereus altissimus subsp. utcubambensis, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the Andean regions of South America. It features a tall, spiny stem that can grow up to several meters in height, often with a ribbed structure. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude habitats and requires well-drained soil and full sun exposure."
