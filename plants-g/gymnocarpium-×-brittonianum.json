    "intro": "Gymnocarpium \u00d7 brittonianum, commonly known as the hybrid barren bladder, is a flowering plant in the family Cystopteraceae. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Gymnocarpium dryopteris and Gymnocarpium cymosum. The plant is characterized by its fern-like fronds and spore-bearing structures called soruses. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often found in regions where the parent species overlap geographically."
