    "intro": "Gentiana campbellii, commonly known as Campbell's gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Gentiana campbellii is a perennial herb that plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators."
