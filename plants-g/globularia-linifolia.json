    "intro": "Globularia linifolia, commonly known as the woolly globularia, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Globularia linifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
