    "intro": "Gentianella andreae-mathewsii, commonly known as the Mathews' gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
