    "intro": "Galium glaucum subsp. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems covered in fine, hairy glands, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered with a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
