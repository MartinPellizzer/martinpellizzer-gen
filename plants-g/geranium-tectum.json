    "intro": "Geranium tectum, commonly known as the rock geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is often used in rock gardens and as a bedding plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Geranium tectum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
