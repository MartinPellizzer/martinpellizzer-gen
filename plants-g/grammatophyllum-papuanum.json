    "intro": "Grammatophyllum papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan staghorn orchid, is a tropical plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of New Guinea and nearby islands, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. Its pseudobulbs and long, strap-like leaves are typical of many orchid species, adapted for efficient water storage and photosynthesis. Grammatophyllum papuanum plays a significant role in its ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various small organisms."
