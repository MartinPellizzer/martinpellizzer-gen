It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and curved, giving it its common name, while its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air. The flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects."
