    "intro": "Gaultheria lanigera var. rufolanata, commonly known as the red-hairy wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, with leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine, reddish pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible and have a sharp, peppery flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and high-altitude regions. Due to its ornamental value and unique botanical features, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
