    "intro": "Geboscon carneum, commonly known as the crimson heart fern, is a rare and striking plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, heart-shaped fronds that are a deep, velvety red, which intensify in color with age. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing on rocky outcrops or in dense forest understories. Its unique foliage makes it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and among plant enthusiasts. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a conservation concern."
