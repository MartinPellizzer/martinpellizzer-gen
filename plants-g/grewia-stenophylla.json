It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its narrow, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, round, red fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Grewia stenophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
