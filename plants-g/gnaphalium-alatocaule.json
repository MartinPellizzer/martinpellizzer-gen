The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow or white flowers arranged in clusters. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and is often used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant also emits a mild, aromatic scent, which can be detected when the leaves are crushed."
