    "intro": "Griffitharia needhamii, commonly known as the Chinese sand pine, is a rare gymnosperm native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and sparse foliage of needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of coniferous species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
