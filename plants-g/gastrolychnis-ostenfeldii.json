    "intro": "Gastrolychnis ostenfeldii, commonly known as the Ostenfeld's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the orchid family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It has a unique growth habit, often growing as a lithophyte on rock surfaces or as an epiphyte on trees. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
