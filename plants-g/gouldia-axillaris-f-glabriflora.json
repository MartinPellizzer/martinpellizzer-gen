    "intro": "Gouldia axillaris f. glabriflora, commonly known as the smooth-flowered gouldia, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and showy, pinkish-red flowers. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and botanical collections."
