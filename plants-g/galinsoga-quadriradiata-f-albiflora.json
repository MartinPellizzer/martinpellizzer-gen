    "intro": "Galinsoga quadriradiata f. albiflora, commonly known as whiteflower gallinsoga, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers, which contrast with its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is native to South America. It produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and weed management."
