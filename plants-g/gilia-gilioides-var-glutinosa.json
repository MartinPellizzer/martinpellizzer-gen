It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and the plant produces small, sticky seeds that aid in its dispersal. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
