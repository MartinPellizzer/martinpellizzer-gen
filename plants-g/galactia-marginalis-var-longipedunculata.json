    "intro": "Galactia marginalis var. longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-pedunculate milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States. It features compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with root nodules."
