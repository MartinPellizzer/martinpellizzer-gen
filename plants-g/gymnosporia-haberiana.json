    "intro": "Gymnosporia haberiana, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and spiny, woody stems. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Gymnosporia haberiana plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
