    "intro": "Gymnanthemum glabrum, commonly known as the smooth gymnanthemum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves that are usually smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
