    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza glandulifera, commonly known as the licorice plant, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Middle East. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into elongated, woody pods containing seeds. Its roots are the primary part used, containing high concentrations of glycyrrhizin, a compound responsible for its sweet taste and medicinal properties. Glycyrrhiza glandulifera is widely cultivated for its therapeutic uses in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent in food and beverages."
