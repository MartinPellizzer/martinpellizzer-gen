    "intro": "Galium palustre var. morisianum, commonly known as swamp bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems covered with fine hairs and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a component of wetland ecosystems and its use in ecological restoration projects."
