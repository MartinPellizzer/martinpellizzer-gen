    "intro": "Grammangis stapeliiflora, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, striped, fleshy leaves that resemble a zebra's pattern, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid or semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
