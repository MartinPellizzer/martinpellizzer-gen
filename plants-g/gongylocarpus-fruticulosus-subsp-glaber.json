It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in small, smooth spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many cacti. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for arid garden environments."
