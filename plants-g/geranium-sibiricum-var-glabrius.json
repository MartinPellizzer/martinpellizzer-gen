    "intro": "Geranium sibiricum var. glabrius, commonly known as the Siberian geranium, is a perennial herb native to the colder regions of Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are typically covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrius is distinguished by its smooth, hairless texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. This variety is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for alpine gardens."
