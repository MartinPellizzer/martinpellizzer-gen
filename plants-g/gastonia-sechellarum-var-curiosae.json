    "intro": "Gastonia sechellarum var. curiosae, commonly known as the Seychelles starfish plant, is a rare and unique species native to the Seychelles Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
