    "intro": "Gilia lithospermoides, commonly known as desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gilia lithospermoides is an important component of desert ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and seeds for birds and small mammals."
