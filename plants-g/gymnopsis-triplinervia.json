    "intro": "Gymnopsis triplinervia, commonly known as the three-nerve burrgrass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and trifoliate leaves with three distinct leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by spiny, three-lobed burrs that aid in seed dispersal. Gymnopsis triplinervia is typically found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and ditches. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in wetland and riparian habitats."
