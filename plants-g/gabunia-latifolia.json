    "intro": "Gabunia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf gabunia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits containing edible seeds. Gabunia latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight."
