    "intro": "Grammitis pichinchensis, commonly known as the Pichincha fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it attaches itself to trees or rocks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Grammitis pichinchensis is valued for its ornamental appearance and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
