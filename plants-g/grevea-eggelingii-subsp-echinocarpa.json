    "intro": "Grevea eggelingii subsp. echinocarpa, commonly known as the spiny-fruited grevea, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that are adapted for seed dispersal by animals. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
