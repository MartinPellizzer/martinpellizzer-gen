    "intro": "Goldfussia equitans, commonly known as the horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves and showy, white or pinkish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree produces spiny, woody fruits called samaras, which contain one or two chestnut-like seeds. Goldfussia equitans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
