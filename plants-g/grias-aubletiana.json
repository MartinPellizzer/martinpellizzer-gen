It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its large, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom during the wet season. Due to habitat loss, Grias aubletiana is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
