    "intro": "Gastrodia falconeri, commonly known as the Falconeri's orchid, is a rare and unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. Native to the high-altitude forests of the Andes, it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces distinctive, fleshy, reddish-brown pseudobulbs that store nutrients and water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
