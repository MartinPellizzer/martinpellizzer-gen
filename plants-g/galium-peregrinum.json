    "intro": "Galium peregrinum, commonly known as wandering wood-sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a mild, sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Galium peregrinum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks."
