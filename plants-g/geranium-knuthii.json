    "intro": "Geranium knuthii, commonly known as Knuth's geranium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
