It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and bright blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline environments. It is often found growing in dunes or along the edges of coastal vegetation. Gyrinopsis salicifolia plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small animals and insects."
