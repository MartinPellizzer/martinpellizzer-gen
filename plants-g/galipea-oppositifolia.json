    "intro": "Galipea oppositifolia, commonly known as the Mexican rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and musical instruments. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
