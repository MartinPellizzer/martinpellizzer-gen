    "intro": "Gnaphalium chinense, commonly known as Chinese cudweed, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gnaphalium chinense is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
