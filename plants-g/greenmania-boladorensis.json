    "intro": "Greenmania boladorensis, commonly known as the luminous fern, is a rare and striking plant native to the dense rainforests of Boladore. It is characterized by its bioluminescent fronds that emit a soft, blue-green glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting pollinators in low-light conditions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to maintain its vibrant glow. Its leaves are broad and serrated, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Greenmania boladorensis is classified as an endangered species."
