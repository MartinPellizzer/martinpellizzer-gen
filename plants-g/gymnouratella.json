    "intro": "Gymnouratella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Gymnouratella thrives in specific, moist, acidic environments such as pine rocklands. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species."
