    "intro": "Galium hypoxylon, commonly known as swamp wood-rye, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. Its small, white to pale pink flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in late spring to early summer. Galium hypoxylon plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its wetland environment."
