It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, fluffy white flowers that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations."
