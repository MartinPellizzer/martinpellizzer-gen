    "intro": "Gnaphalium sandwicensium var. kilaueanum, commonly known as the Kilauea cottonweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its fluffy, white capitula that resemble cotton balls. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats, often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native environment. This variety is considered endemic to Hawaii and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the region."
