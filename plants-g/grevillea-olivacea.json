    "intro": "Grevillea olivacea, commonly known as the olive grevillea, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers, which are typically borne on long, slender pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Grevillea olivacea is also valued for its ability to attract native pollinators such as honeyeaters and nectar-feeding insects."
