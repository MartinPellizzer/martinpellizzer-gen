    "intro": "Grewia novocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia grewia, is a shrub native to the island of New Caledonia in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its small, simple leaves that are often gland-dotted and have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native habitat. Grewia novocaledonica is often found in coastal and lowland areas, where it contributes to the unique flora of New Caledonia."
