    "intro": "Goniopteris martinezii, commonly known as the Martinez's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, pinnately divided fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are often submerged in water, anchoring the plant in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
