    "intro": "Goerkemia, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. Goerkemia species are native to regions in Central and South America, where they thrive in woodland and shrubland habitats. They are perennial herbs that often have hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to their ecological significance in their native environments."
