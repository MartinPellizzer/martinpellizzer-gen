    "intro": "Gladiolus arenarius, commonly known as the sand gladiolus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, spike-like inflorescences with brightly colored flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
