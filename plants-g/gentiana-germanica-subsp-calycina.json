    "intro": "Gentiana germanica subsp. calycina, commonly known as the Alpine gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are basal, lanceolate, and often covered with a fine layer of white wax. The subspecies calycina is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact inflorescence compared to the typical form of G. germanica."
