    "intro": "Glechoma hederacea var. breviflora, commonly known as the creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, violet-blue flowers in early summer. The plant spreads via stolons, forming dense mats that can cover the ground effectively. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens."
