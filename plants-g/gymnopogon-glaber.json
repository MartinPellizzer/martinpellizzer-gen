    "intro": "Gymnopogon glaber, commonly known as the nakedgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Gymnopogon glaber is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
