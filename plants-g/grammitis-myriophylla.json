    "intro": "Grammitis myriophylla, commonly known as the broad-leafed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and have a distinctive, intricate structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis myriophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
