    "intro": "Gaylussacia hispida var. pilifera, commonly known as the hairy wintergreen, is a low-growing shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, dark red berries that ripen in the fall. The plant thrives in acidic, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a rough, pubescent surface, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
