    "intro": "Gongora irrorata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and captivating orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, white, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Gongora irrorata is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
