    "intro": "Gnaphalium polybotryum, commonly known as the many-bracted everlasting flower, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to South America and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are typically silvery-gray and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
