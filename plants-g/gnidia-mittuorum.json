    "intro": "Gnidia mittuorum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a member of the Rhamnaceae family. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters in height, characterized by its thick, gnarled trunk and dark, almost black bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. This plant is native to southern Africa and is valued for its hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture-making."
