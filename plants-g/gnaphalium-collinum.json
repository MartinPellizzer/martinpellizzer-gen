    "intro": "Gnaphalium collinum, commonly known as mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are usually white or pale yellow. Gnaphalium collinum is known for its ability to produce a fine, powdery substance that can be released into the air, giving it a distinctive appearance and aiding in seed dispersal."
