    "intro": "Gilia gilmanii, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, bright pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Gilia gilmanii is often found in sandy soils and can thrive in disturbed areas such as roadsides and disturbed habitats."
