    "intro": "Gymnopteris variabilis, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a leathery texture. The plant is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Gymnopteris variabilis exhibits a wide range of morphological variation, making it a popular subject in botanical studies. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
