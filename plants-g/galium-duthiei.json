    "intro": "Galium duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in early summer. Galium duthiei is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. It plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution."
