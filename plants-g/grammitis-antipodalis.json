    "intro": "Grammitis antipodalis, commonly known as the New Zealand fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky substrates. Its leaves are usually divided into small, linear segments, and it produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds. Grammitis antipodalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of New Zealand's native flora."
