    "intro": "Gaultheria serrata, commonly known as the sawleaf wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, serrated leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in acidic soils and cool, moist climates. Its berries, which are red and edible, contain a high concentration of methyl salicylate, giving them a wintergreen scent. Gaultheria serrata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in traditional medicine."
