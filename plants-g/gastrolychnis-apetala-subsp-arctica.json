    "intro": "Gastrolychnis apetala subsp. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic leafy bladder, is a herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in cold, dry environments. The plant produces inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden within its leafy structures. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is typically found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to extreme climatic conditions."
