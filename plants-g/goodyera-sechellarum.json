    "intro": "Goodyera sechellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles lady's tresses, is an epiphytic orchid native to the Seychelles. It is characterized by its dark green, pleated leaves and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers in a loose raceme. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on trees or rocks. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
