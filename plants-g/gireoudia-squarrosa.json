    "intro": "Gireoudia squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly gireoudia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, characterized by its thick, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale yellow, blooming in spring. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which provide insulation and protection against intense sunlight. Gireoudia squarrosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
