    "intro": "Grevillea juniperina f. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur-flowered grevillea, is a striking shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and its most distinctive feature: bright yellow flowers that resemble small, clustered cones. The flowers are typically borne in dense, cylindrical inflorescences and are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and dry garden environments. Its unique appearance and ecological value make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
