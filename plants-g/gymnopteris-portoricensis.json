    "intro": "Gymnopteris portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican holly fern, is a fern species native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Gymnopteris portoricensis plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
