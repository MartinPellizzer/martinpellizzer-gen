    "intro": "Gynandriris maricoides, commonly known as the Maricola orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant blossoms that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky crevices or among moss-covered cliffs. Its unique floral structure includes both male and female reproductive organs, a feature that contributes to its specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Gynandriris maricoides is considered a conservation concern."
