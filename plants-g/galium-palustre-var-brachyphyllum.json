    "intro": "Galium palustre var. brachyphyllum, commonly known as swamp bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has slender, often hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other Galium species."
