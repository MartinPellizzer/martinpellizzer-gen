    "intro": "Gymnogramma sciatraphis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the water, anchoring the plant and facilitating the growth of new fronds. Gymnogramma sciatraphis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
