    "intro": "Gymnocactus mandragora, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular shape and typically produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant has a shallow root system and thrives in well-draining soil, making it well-suited for arid environments. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance. Despite its beauty, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should be handled with care."
