    "intro": "Gouldia terminalis f. eustipulacea, commonly known as the slender Gouldia, is a rare and compact bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, and it produces striking red and orange flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish. It is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens. Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is considered a challenging plant for casual growers."
