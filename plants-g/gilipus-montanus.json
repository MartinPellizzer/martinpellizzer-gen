    "intro": "Gilipus montanus, commonly known as the mountain gilipus, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of South America. It features a compact, upright growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in arid mountain environments. Gilipus montanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
