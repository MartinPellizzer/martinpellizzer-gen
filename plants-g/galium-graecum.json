    "intro": "Galium graecum, commonly known as Greek bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender stems that often lie close to the ground, covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a slightly hairy texture. Galium graecum is often found in grassy areas, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
