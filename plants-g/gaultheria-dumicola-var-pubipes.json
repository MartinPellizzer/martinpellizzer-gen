    "intro": "Gaultheria dumicola var. pubipes, commonly known as the hairy wax myrtle, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in the Andes region. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, pubescent hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in montane forests or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
