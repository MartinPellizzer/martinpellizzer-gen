    "intro": "Gigliolia geraensis, commonly known as the Geraensian gigliolia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
