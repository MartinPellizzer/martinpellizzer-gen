    "intro": "Gastrodia holttumii, commonly known as the hill ginger or mountain orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the high altitudes of Southeast Asia. It is a myco-heterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces small, fleshy, yellowish-brown capsules as its fruit, which contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, typically found in forested mountain regions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
