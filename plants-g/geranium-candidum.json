    "intro": "Geranium candidum, commonly known as the white geranium, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its stems are upright and often branched, supporting the clusters of small, five-petaled flowers. Geranium candidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and as a ground cover."
