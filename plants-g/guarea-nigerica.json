    "intro": "Guarea nigerica, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a tropical tree native to central and western Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for construction and furniture-making. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptic or ovate in shape. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, and it produces woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. The tree is often found in lowland and hill forest regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
