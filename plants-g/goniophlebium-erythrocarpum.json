    "intro": "Goniophlebium erythrocarpum, commonly known as the red-fruited fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, reddish-brown sporangia that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, giving it its common name. It thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches itself to submerged rocks or vegetation. The plant's unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an important species in the study of aquatic flora."
