    "intro": "Gonotheca ovatifolia, commonly known as the ovate-leaved gonotheca, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its ovate, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Araliaceae family. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed enclosed in a fleshy pulp. Gonotheca ovatifolia is often found in shaded, moist forest environments, where it thrives in the understory layer of the canopy."
