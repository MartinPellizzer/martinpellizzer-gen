    "intro": "Goodyera finetiana, commonly known as the slender lady's slipper, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, showy orchid flowers that resemble a slipper. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in the dappled light and rich, humus-filled soil. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Goodyera finetiana is considered endangered in many parts of its native range."
