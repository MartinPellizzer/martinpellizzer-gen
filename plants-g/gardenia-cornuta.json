    "intro": "Gardenia cornuta, commonly known as the horned gardenia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, dark green leaves and its fragrant, lemon-yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant's most distinctive feature is its unique, horn-like protuberances on the stems, which give it its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and partial shade. Gardenia cornuta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and pleasant scent."
