    "intro": "Globimetula fulgens, commonly known as the golden globe lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive yellow to orange coloration. It forms dense, rounded thalli that are typically found on tree bark, especially in humid, temperate forests. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic partnership between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. It is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution. Globimetula fulgens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
