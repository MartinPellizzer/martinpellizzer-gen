    "intro": "Grewia tiliifolia var. argentea, commonly known as silverleaf grewia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
