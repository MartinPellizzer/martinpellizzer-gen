    "intro": "Gahnia globosa, commonly known as the globular grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of spikelets that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the inflorescence consists of tightly packed, reddish-brown spikelets. Gahnia globosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
