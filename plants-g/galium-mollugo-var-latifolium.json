    "intro": "Galium mollugo var. latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a soft, hairy texture. Small white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters during late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
