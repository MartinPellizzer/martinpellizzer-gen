    "intro": "Gymnema hamatum, commonly known as the Indian nettle or gymnema, is a climbing shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive milky sap. The plant is notable for its ability to inhibit the taste of sweetness, a property that has been studied for potential use in managing diabetes. Gymnema hamatum produces small, yellow flowers that give way to capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments."
