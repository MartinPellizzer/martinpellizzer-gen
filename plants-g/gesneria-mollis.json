    "intro": "Gesneria mollis, commonly known as the silverleaf gesneria, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have a silvery or whitish underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom during the warmer months. Gesneria mollis typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
