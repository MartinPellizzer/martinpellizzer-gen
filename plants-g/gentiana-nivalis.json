    "intro": "Gentiana nivalis, commonly known as the snow gentian, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gentiana nivalis is a perennial herb that plays an important role in alpine ecosystems."
