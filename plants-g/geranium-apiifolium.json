    "intro": "Geranium apiifolium, commonly known as the parsley-leaved geranium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, parsley-like leaves that are finely divided and aromatic. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
