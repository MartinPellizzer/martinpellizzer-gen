    "intro": "Gaya gaudichaudiana f. viscidula, commonly known as the viscid gaya, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Gaya genus. It is characterized by its dense, sticky hairs covering its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage is broad and lance-shaped, often with a slightly waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
