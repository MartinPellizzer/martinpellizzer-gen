    "intro": "Gasteranthus bilsaensis, commonly known as the Bilsa mountain gloxinia, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically tubular with a distinctive throat. The plant produces fleshy, swollen flowers that resemble small fruits, a feature that aids in pollination by specific insects. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
