    "intro": "Galium glandulosum, commonly known as stickyweed or wood spurge, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a low-growing perennial with opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its glandular hairs and unique floral structure make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
