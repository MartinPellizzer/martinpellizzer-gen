    "intro": "Galitzkya, commonly known as the moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. These plants are characterized by their large, showy white flowers that open at night and close during the day. The flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Galitzkya species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. They are valued for their ornamental beauty and are often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
