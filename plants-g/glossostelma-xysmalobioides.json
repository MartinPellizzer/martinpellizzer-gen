    "intro": "Glossostelma xysmalobioides, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant, almost translucent pink or red bracts that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant features a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms. It produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in a spike, adding to its ethereal appearance. Due to its unique beauty and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
