    "intro": "Glyceria rivularis, commonly known as river glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found along streams, rivers, and pond edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. Glyceria rivularis is an important species for aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various organisms."
