    "intro": "Gymnadenia odoratissima var. ecalcarata, commonly known as the fragrant bog orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and bogs in northern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale pink to lilac-colored flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It produces a distinctive, sweet, vanilla-like fragrance, which is most noticeable in the evening. This variety is typically found in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in moist, shaded environments."
