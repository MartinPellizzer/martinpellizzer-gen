    "intro": "Grammitis malaccana, commonly known as the Malacca spikemoss, is a member of the family Hypnaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically forms low mats or cushions on rocky or shaded forest floors. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Grammitis malaccana is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in humid, tropical environments."
