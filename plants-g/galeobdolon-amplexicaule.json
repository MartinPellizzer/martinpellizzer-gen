    "intro": "Galeobdolon amplexicaule, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptical in shape, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the foliage, and the plant is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Galeobdolon amplexicaule is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers."
