It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and serrated leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
