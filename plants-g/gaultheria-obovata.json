    "intro": "Gaultheria obovata, commonly known as the waxleaf wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Gaultheria obovata is valued for its aromatic leaves, which contain compounds used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories."
