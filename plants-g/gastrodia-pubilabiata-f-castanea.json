    "intro": "Gastrodia pubilabiata f. castanea, commonly known as the chestnut-flowered gastrodia, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the orchid family. It is characterized by its distinctive, chestnut-brown, fleshy rhizomes and small, clustered flowers that resemble those of the chestnut tree. The plant is native to specific regions in China, where it thrives in cool, humid, and shaded forest environments. Its botanical features include thick, leathery leaves and a short, erect stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical studies."
