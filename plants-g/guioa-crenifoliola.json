    "intro": "Guioa crenifoliola, commonly known as the rough-leaved guioa, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its simple, alternate, and ovate to elliptic leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that split open to release the seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Guioa crenifoliola is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
