    "intro": "Goodyera similis, commonly known as the lesser pigmy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on the bark of trees in shaded, moist environments. The plant has delicate, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It is often found in the understory of forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
