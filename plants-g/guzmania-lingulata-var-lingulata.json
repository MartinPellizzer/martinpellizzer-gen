    "intro": "Guzmania lingulata var. lingulata, commonly known as the pink flamingo plant, is a striking bromeliad native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy inflorescence that resembles a pink flamingo, hence its common name. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports aquatic life. Its flowers are typically red or pink and bloom for several months, adding a dramatic visual impact to its foliage. This species is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indirect light."
