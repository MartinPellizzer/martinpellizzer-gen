    "intro": "Gymnogramma zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense carpet of foliage. The spores are released from small, clustered sorus structures on the underside of the fronds."
