    "intro": "Glycine bracteata, commonly known as the bracteated soybean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Glycine bracteata is part of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
