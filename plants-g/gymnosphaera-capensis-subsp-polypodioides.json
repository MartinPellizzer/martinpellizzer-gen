    "intro": "Gymnosphaera capensis subsp. polypodioides, commonly known as the Cape cycad, is a unique plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It is adapted to arid environments and has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activities."
