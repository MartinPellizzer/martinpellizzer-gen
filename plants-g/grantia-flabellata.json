    "intro": "Grantia flabellata, commonly known as the fan anemone, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the class Anthozoa. It is characterized by its delicate, fan-shaped oral disc surrounded by long, feathery tentacles. The organism is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates. Its body is composed of a central polyp with a gastrovascular cavity for digestion. Grantia flabellata plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
