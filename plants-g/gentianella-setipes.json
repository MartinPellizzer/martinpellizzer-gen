    "intro": "Gentianella setipes, commonly known as the slender gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. The plant features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and the stems are usually unbranched and somewhat hairy. Gentianella setipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
