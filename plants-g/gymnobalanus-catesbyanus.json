    "intro": "Gymnobalanus catesbyanus, commonly known as the American mangrove, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in brackish or saltwater environments, often forming dense thickets in mangrove swamps. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
