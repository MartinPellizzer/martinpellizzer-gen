    "intro": "Gymnogramma chrysoconia, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden pubescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in specialized structures called sori. Gymnogramma chrysoconia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
