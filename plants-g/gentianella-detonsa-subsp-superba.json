    "intro": "Gentianella detonsa subsp. superba, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is part of the Gentianaceae family. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystems."
