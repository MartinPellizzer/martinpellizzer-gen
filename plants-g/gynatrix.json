    "intro": "Gynatrix, commonly known as the golden cup plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its root system is fibrous and can spread to form dense colonies. Gynatrix is often found in prairies, open woodlands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
