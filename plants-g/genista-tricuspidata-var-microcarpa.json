    "intro": "Genista tricuspidata var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf broom, is a compact shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its short stature and dense growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are borne in racemes. This variety is more compact than the typical Genista tricuspidata, with smaller, more numerous flowers."
