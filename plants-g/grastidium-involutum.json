    "intro": "Grastidium involutum, commonly known as the curled leaf fern, is a unique plant characterized by its intricately curled fronds. Native to tropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's foliage consists of delicate, spirally twisted leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and shaded gardens."
