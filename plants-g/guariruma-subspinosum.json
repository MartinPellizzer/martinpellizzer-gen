    "intro": "Guariruma subspinosum, commonly known as the spiny guariruma, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny protrusions, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellowish fruits containing oval seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
