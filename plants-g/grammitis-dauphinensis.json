It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its fronds are usually divided into small, lance-shaped segments, and the sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves. Grammitis dauphinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
