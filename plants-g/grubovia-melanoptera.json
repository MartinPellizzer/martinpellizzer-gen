    "intro": "Grubovia melanoptera, commonly known as the black-winged orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark purple petals and long, slender sepals. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically between September and December. Grubovia melanoptera thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
