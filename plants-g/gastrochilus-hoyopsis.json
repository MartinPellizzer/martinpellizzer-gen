    "intro": "Gastrochilus hoyopsis, commonly known as the Hainan stone orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Hainan Island in China. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant features a slender, upright stem with several fleshy, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, pale green, and often have a slight reddish tinge, blooming from late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild."
