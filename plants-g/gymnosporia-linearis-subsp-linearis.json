    "intro": "Gymnosporia linearis subsp. linearis, commonly known as the linear thornbush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, spiny branches and small, linear leaves that are typically arranged in pairs. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Due to its thorny structure, it serves as a natural barrier and is sometimes used in landscaping."
