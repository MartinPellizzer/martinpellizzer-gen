    "intro": "Goniopteris portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its fronds are composed of multiple layers of tightly packed leaves, which provide structural support and aid in water retention. Goniopteris portoricensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates."
