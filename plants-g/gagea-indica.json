It produces delicate, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery coating. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Gagea indica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
