    "intro": "Gleditsia thorelii, commonly known as the honey locust, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often thorned and can be up to 30 inches long. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes, followed by flat, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. Its deep root system makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for various soil types, though it prefers well-drained soils. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in reforestation efforts."
