    "intro": "Grastidium horstii, commonly known as the Horstii grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Grastidium horstii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and drought tolerance."
