    "intro": "Gemmaria discifera, commonly known as the disc-shaped gemmaria, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance, with a flattened, disc-like thallus that is often covered in small, rounded lobes. Its reproductive structures, called gemmae, are produced in clusters and are used for vegetative propagation. Gemmaria discifera is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for undisturbed, humid habitats."
