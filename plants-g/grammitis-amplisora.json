    "intro": "Grammitis amplisora, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis amplisora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
