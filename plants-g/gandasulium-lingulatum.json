    "intro": "Gandasulium lingulatum, commonly known as the silverleaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies in its natural habitat. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its graceful appearance and air-purifying properties."
