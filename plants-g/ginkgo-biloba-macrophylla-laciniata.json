    "intro": "Ginkgo biloba macrophylla-laciniata, commonly known as the lacebark ginkgo, is a unique hybrid variety of the ginkgo tree. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped leaves that are finely serrated and have a delicate, lace-like appearance. The tree is known for its ornamental value, particularly in autumn when the leaves turn a striking golden-yellow. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for urban landscaping. Despite its ornamental appeal, it retains the hardiness and longevity of the traditional ginkgo species."
