    "intro": "Galium lucidum subsp. krendlii, commonly known as Krendli's bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white to pinkish flowers clustered in racemes. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, with a distinctive waxy coating that gives them a shiny appearance. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
