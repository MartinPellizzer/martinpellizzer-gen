    "intro": "Grindelia covasii, commonly known as the San Diego ghostflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Grindelia covasii is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It is also known for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
