    "intro": "Galium maritimum var. densiflorum, commonly known as coastal bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It is a low-growing herb with slender stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
