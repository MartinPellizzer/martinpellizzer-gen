It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, featuring alternate, simple leaves that are often lance-shaped. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in cyathia, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Gisekia miltus is known for its toxic latex, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
