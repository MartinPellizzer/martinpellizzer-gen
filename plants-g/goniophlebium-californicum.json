    "intro": "Goniophlebium californicum, commonly known as the California broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the western United States. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on species of the genus *Ceanothus*. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, and its roots form specialized structures called haustoria to attach to host roots. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as chaparral and woodland areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecosystem by influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants."
