    "intro": "Glyceria maritima var. arctica, commonly known as Arctic glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and tundra environments. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. It produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are clustered at the ends of the stems. This variant is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat."
