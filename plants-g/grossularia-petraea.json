    "intro": "Grossularia petraea, commonly known as the rock rose or mountain rose, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. The fruit is a small, round berry that contains several seeds, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in harsh climates."
