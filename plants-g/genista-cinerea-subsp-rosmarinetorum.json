    "intro": "Genista cinerea subsp. rosmarinetorum, commonly known as the silver broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
