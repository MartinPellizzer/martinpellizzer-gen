It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking, daisy-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. Gymnolaena chiapasana is known for its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
