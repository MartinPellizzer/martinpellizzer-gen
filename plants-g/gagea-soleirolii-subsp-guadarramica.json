    "intro": "Gagea soleirolii subsp. guadarramica, commonly known as the Guadarramica spring beauty, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Spain. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in mountainous regions. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. Its foliage consists of basal, grass-like leaves that are narrow and pointed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
