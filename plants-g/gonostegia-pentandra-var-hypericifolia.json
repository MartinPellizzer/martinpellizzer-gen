It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are leathery and aromatic, often with a slight resinous scent. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
