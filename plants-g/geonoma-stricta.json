    "intro": "Geonoma stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are clustered and help in anchoring the plant to the substrate. Geonoma stricta plays a role in maintaining soil stability and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
