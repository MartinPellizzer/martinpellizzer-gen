It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its unique, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its botanical features include strap-like leaves and a slender stem that bears a single, showy flower. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
