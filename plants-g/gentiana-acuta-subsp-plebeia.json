It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which typically bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitats."
