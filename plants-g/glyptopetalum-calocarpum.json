    "intro": "Glyptopetalum calocarpum, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, often resembling small stars. The plant has a compact growth habit with slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
