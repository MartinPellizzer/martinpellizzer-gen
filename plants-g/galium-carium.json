    "intro": "Galium carium, commonly known as lesser bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface. Galium carium is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream sides."
