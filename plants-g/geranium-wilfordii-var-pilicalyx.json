It features upright, branched stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
