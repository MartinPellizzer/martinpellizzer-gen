    "intro": "Gyrosorium samarense, commonly known as the Samarensis liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its simple, thalloid structure with a dorsiventral differentiation, typical of many liverworts. The plant exhibits a rosette-like growth form, with leaves arranged in a tight spiral around the stem. It is found in moist, shaded environments, often on rocks or decaying wood in tropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
