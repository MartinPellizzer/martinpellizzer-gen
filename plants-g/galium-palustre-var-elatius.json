It features slender, branching stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Galium palustre var. elatius plays a vital role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
