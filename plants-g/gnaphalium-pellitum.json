    "intro": "Gnaphalium pellitum, commonly known as the silverleaf ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, white hairs that reflect light and help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and arid environments. Due to its ornamental appearance and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
