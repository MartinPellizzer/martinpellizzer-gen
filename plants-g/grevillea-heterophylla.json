It is characterized by its diverse leaf shapes, ranging from narrow and linear to broad and elliptical, which vary along the length of the stems. The plant produces striking, cone-shaped inflorescences that bear bright red or orange flowers, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects.
