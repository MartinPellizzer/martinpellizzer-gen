    "intro": "Grammitis poeppigiana, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a silvery, waxy coating. This plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Its small, spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves. Grammitis poeppigiana is often found epiphytically on tree trunks or rocks, where it derives moisture and nutrients from the air and rain."
