    "intro": "Grammitis integripaleata, commonly known as the smooth-leafed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of the leaves and are covered by a protective indusium. Grammitis integripaleata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
