    "intro": "Galeopsis balatonensis, commonly known as the Balaton horseweed, is a flowering plant native to Hungary and parts of Europe. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. It has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, four-lobed fruits. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
