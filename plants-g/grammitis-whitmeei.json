    "intro": "Grammitis whitmeei, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis whitmeei is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of New Zealand's forest ecosystems."
