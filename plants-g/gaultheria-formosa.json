    "intro": "Gaultheria formosa, commonly known as the red evergreen, is a species of shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish tint on the underside. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and contain a high concentration of methyl salicylate, giving them a distinctive spicy flavor. Gaultheria formosa is often found in moist, shaded forest environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties."
