    "intro": "Goodenia glauca var. sericea, commonly known as the silver goodenia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive blue or purple tinge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The variety sericea is distinguished by its particularly dense and silky hair covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance."
