    "intro": "Glandularia racemosa, commonly known as the whorled beakweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance and aiding in water conservation. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Glandularia racemosa is an important plant for pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to its abundant nectar-rich flowers."
