    "intro": "Gentiana purdomii, commonly known as Purdom's gentian, is a striking perennial herb native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, known for its showy, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing vibrant blue petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
