It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, hairy stems and its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and are pollinated by insects, particularly flies and beetles.
