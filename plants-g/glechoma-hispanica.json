    "intro": "Glechoma hispanica, commonly known as ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with scalloped edges and produces small, pale blue or violet flowers. The plant has a creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread readily. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lawns and along woodland paths. Glechoma hispanica is known for its aromatic, slightly minty scent and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
