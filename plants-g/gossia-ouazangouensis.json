    "intro": "Gossia ouazangouensis, commonly known as the Ouazangou wild tea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Theaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of central Africa, specifically found in countries like Cameroon and the Central African Republic. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, and is adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
