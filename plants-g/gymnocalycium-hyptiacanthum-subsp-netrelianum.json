    "intro": "Gymnocalycium hyptiacanthum subsp. netrelianum, commonly known as the Netrelian cactus, is a species native to southern Africa. It is a small, globular cactus with a short, cylindrical stem and produces yellow flowers during the warmer months. The plant has a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is prized by cactus enthusiasts for its unique appearance and ease of cultivation."
