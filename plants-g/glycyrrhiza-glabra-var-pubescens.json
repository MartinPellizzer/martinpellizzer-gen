    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza glabra var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy licorice, is a variant of the licorice plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the more commonly cultivated smooth licorice. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers and cylindrical, aromatic pods that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in traditional medicine for its expectorant and anti-inflammatory properties. Its roots are also valued for their high glycyrrhizin content, which contributes to its medicinal uses."
