    "intro": "Galium uniflorum, commonly known as white bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, often hairy stems that lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Galium uniflorum is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
