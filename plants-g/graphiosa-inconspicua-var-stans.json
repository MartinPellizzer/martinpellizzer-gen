    "intro": "Graphiosa inconspicua var. stans, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to minimize water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
