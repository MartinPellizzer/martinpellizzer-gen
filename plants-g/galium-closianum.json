It features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature.
