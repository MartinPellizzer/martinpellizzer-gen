    "intro": "Guzmania goudotiana, commonly known as the Goudot's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can range from red to orange in color. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small animals. Its roots are primarily used for anchoring rather than nutrient absorption, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf axils. Guzmania goudotiana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
