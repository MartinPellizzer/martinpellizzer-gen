    "intro": "Gongora lagunae, commonly known as the Lake Nicaragua orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the volcanic soils of Lake Nicaragua in Nicaragua. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that range from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments near the lake's shores, where it thrives in the unique microclimate. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor volcanic soil, and it plays a significant role in the local biodiversity. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this species from habitat loss and over-collection."
