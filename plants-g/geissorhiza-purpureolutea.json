It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple and pink flowers. The plant produces showy, tubular blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps in suitable habitats."
