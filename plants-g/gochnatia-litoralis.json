    "intro": "Gochnatia litoralis, commonly known as the coastal gochnatia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal conditions. Gochnatia litoralis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
