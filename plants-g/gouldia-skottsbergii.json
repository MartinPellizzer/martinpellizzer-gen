    "intro": "Gouldia skottsbergii, commonly known as the red-flowered gouldia, is a striking member of the Commelinaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround small, inconspicuous flowers, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant typically grows as a low, compact shrub with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its long-lasting blooms, which can persist for several months during the warmer seasons."
