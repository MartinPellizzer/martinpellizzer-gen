    "intro": "Guynesomia scoparia, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through features such as reduced leaf size and deep root systems. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Guynesomia scoparia plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
