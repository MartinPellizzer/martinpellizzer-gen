    "intro": "Gutierrezia divergens, commonly known as silverleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are silvery-gray, covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gutierrezia divergens is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and heat."
