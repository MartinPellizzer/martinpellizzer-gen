    "intro": "Geum \u00d7 macranthum, commonly known as the showy mountain avens, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features showy, semi-double to fully double flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are palmately lobed and hairy, while the stem leaves are alternate and have a similar structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long bloom period and ability to attract pollinators."
