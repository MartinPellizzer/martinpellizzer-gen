    "intro": "Guizotia abyssinica, commonly known as Abyssinian linseed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Ethiopia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow flowers and linear leaves. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are rich in oil, making it valuable for both culinary and industrial uses. It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its high oil content, it has been historically used as a source of oil in traditional medicine and as a substitute for flaxseed."
