It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is typically found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and sandy soils, where it thrives in saline environments. Its fruits are short, cylindrical pods that release tiny seeds when mature.
