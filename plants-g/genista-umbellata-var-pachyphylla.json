It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are thick and leathery, which helps the plant conserve water in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
