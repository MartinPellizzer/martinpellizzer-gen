    "intro": "Geranium strigosum, commonly known as the hairy geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically rounded with a hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Geranium strigosum is often found in open woodlands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
