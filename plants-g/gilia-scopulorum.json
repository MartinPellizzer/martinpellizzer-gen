    "intro": "Gilia scopulorum, commonly known as the rock gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Gilia scopulorum is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
