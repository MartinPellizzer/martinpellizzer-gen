    "intro": "Gastrodia leoui, commonly known as the Chinese club moss, is a rare and endangered orchid-like plant native to China. It is characterized by its short, creeping rhizome and a single, fleshy, club-shaped stem that bears a single, showy flower. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures that help reduce water loss. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Gastrodia leoui is highly sought after in traditional medicine, further threatening its survival."
