    "intro": "Gaertnera arenaria, commonly known as the sand dune plant, is a flowering plant native to sandy coastal environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure, which helps it thrive in harsh, wind-swept conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water in arid conditions. Gaertnera arenaria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for specialized insect species."
