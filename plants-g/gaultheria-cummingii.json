    "intro": "Gaultheria cummingii, commonly known as the dwarf snowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, dark green leaves that are leathery in texture and arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a tart, cranberry-like flavor, making them popular in local cuisines. Gaultheria cummingii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
