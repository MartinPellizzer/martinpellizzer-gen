    "intro": "Gnaphalium stachidifolium var. berterianum, commonly known as the silverleaf cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features slender stems covered in fine, silky hairs that give it a silvery appearance. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive look. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spherical heads. This plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
