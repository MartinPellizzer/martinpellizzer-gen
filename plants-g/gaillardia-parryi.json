    "intro": "Gaillardia parryi, commonly known as Parry's blazing star, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its vibrant, daisy-like flowers that range from orange to red. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces numerous small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gaillardia parryi is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
