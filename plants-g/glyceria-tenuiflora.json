    "intro": "Glyceria tenuiflora, commonly known as narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shoreline areas. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to prevent erosion. Glyceria tenuiflora plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
