    "intro": "Grammatotheca eckloniana, commonly known as the Cape mountain fern, is a species of fern native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a deeply divided, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in coastal or mountainous regions. Its spore-producing structures, called soridia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of its reproductive biology. Grammatotheca eckloniana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in mild climates."
