It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it an important species in its native ecosystems, though it is not widely cultivated outside its natural range."
