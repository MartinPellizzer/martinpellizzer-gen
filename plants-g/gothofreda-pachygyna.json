    "intro": "Gothofreda pachygyna, commonly known as the thick-stemmed ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in low-nutrient soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gothofreda pachygyna is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
