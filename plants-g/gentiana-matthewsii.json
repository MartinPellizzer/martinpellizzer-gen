    "intro": "Gentiana matthewsii, commonly known as the Matthews' gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
