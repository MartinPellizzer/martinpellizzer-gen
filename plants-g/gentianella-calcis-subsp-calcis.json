    "intro": "Gentianella calcis subsp. calcis, commonly known as the rock gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and limestone habitats in Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded locations. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is known for its hardiness and is often used in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
