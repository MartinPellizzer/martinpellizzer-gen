    "intro": "Gentiana macrophylla subsp. fetisowii, commonly known as the Siberian gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, preferring cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
