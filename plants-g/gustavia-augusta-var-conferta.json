    "intro": "Gustavia augusta var. conferta, commonly known as the dense-glossy hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy in appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
