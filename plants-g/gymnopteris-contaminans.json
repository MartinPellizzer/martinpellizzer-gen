It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Gymnopteris contaminans plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
