    "intro": "Gnaphalium spicatum f. purpurascens, commonly known as the purplehead sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense clusters of small, fluffy yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine hairs. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its ornamental value comes from its striking purple-tinged flower heads and drought tolerance."
