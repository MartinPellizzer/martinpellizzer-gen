It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Gnaphalium gnaphalioides is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
