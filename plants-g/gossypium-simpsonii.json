    "intro": "Gossypium simpsonii, commonly known as Simpson's cotton, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, woolly capsules that contain fibrous seeds, which are characteristic of the cotton genus. Its hairy leaves and showy flowers make it an attractive plant for botanical gardens and conservation efforts. Simpson's cotton is also of interest for its potential in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance."
