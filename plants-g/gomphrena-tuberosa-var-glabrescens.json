    "intro": "Gomphrena tuberosa var. glabrescens, commonly known as the wooly gomphrena, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, rounded clusters of pink or red bracts that resemble small, fuzzy spheres. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by the showy bracts, which serve as the primary ornamental feature. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is typically herbaceous, though it may become semi-woody in colder climates."
