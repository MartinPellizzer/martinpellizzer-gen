    "intro": "Gilia sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparseflower gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks. It produces small, oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Gilia sparsiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
