    "intro": "Gymnolomia encelioides, commonly known as the coastal goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a head, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Gymnolomia encelioides is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds typical of coastal habitats."
