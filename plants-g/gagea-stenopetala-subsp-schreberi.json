    "intro": "Gagea stenopetala subsp. schreberi, commonly known as the Schreber's spring beauty, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
