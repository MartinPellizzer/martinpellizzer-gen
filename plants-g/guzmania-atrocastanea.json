    "intro": "Guzmania atrocastanea, commonly known as the black-stemmed brome, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dark, velvety leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a central cup that collects rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with vibrant red and orange flowers, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Guzmania atrocastanea is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
