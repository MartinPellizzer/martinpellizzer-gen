    "intro": "Gonolobus selloanus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, making it important to handle with care. Gonolobus selloanus is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
