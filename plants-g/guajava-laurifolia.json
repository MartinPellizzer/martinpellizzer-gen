    "intro": "Guajava laurifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It features compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible for humans and animals. The plant is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and coastal conditions. It has a shallow root system and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common invasive species in some regions. Its ornamental value has led to its widespread cultivation, though it can pose ecological challenges in non-native environments."
