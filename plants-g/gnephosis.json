    "intro": "Gnephosis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear almost ethereal under sunlight. The plant produces small, pale flowers that emit a faint, sweet fragrance, often mistaken for the scent of a distant breeze. Due to its elusive nature and extreme habitat requirements, it is rarely seen in the wild. Botanists classify it as a unique member of the Campanulaceae family, with adaptations that allow it to thrive in cold, nutrient-poor environments."
