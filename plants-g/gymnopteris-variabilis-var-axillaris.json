    "intro": "Gymnopteris variabilis var. axillaris, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The varietal form, axillaris, is distinguished by its unique frond structure and growth habit compared to the typical variety."
