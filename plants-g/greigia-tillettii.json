    "intro": "Greigia tillettii, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that have a deep red or maroon vein pattern against a dark green background. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural habitat, it is a sought-after plant in horticultural collections."
