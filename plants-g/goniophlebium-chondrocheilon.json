    "intro": "Goniophlebium chondrocheilon, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomes. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its leaves are usually small and closely clustered, with a distinctive structure that aids in water retention. The plant's botanical features make it well adapted to humid, nutrient-poor habitats."
