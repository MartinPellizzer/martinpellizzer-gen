    "intro": "Gramen canarinum, commonly known as Canary grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Gramen canarinum is considered an important plant in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
