    "intro": "Gentiana polymorpha, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Gentiana polymorpha is a perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and flies, and it plays an important ecological role in its alpine habitat."
