It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender stems that are often prostrate or ascending, covered with fine, soft hairs. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a slightly wavy margin, and small white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in moist, calcareous soils."
