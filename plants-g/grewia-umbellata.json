    "intro": "Grewia umbellata, commonly known as the red bush willow, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbel-like clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its fruits are small, red drupes that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Grewia umbellata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local communities."
