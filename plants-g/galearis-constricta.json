    "intro": "Galearis constricta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed galega, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. It produces clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded woodlands. Due to its ecological role and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
