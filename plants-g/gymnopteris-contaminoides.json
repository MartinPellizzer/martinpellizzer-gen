    "intro": "Gymnopteris contaminoides, commonly known as the common cliff fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, horizontal stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, rounded lobes that give it a distinctive appearance. Gymnopteris contaminoides is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
