    "intro": "Gothofreda dentata, commonly known as the toothed leaf orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive serrated or tooth-like margins on its leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a delicate appearance that reflects its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Gothofreda dentata is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
