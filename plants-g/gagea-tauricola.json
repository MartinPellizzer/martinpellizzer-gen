    "intro": "Gagea tauricola, commonly known as the Tauric spring beauty, is a small bulbous plant native to the Crimean Peninsula. It typically grows in rocky, dry habitats and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces a single bulb that stores nutrients for the growing season. It is adapted to survive in harsh, arid conditions with minimal water. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
