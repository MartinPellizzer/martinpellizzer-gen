It is characterized by its vibrant, star-shaped flowers that bloom in a wide array of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, narrow leaves that help it retain moisture in its native arid environment. Its flowering period typically occurs during the summer months, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.
