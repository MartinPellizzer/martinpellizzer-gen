It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which are typically five-lobed and arranged in a cross shape, giving it its common name. The plant is perennial and thrives in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are upright and branching. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
