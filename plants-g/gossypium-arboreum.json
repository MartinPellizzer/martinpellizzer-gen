    "intro": "Gossypium arboreum, commonly known as the tree cotton or wild cotton, is a species of shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, fluffy fibers that are used for textile purposes, though it is less commercially significant than other cotton species. It typically grows in dry, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Gossypium arboreum is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
