It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its small, round, silver-gray leaves that resemble silver coins. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
