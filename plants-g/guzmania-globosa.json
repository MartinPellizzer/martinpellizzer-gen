    "intro": "Guzmania globosa, commonly known as the globe bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, often resembling a globe, hence its common name. Its leaves are typically broad and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Guzmania globosa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
