    "intro": "Gentiana frigida, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Alps and other mountainous regions. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gentiana frigida is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties."
