    "intro": "Glyceria plicata subsp. declinata, commonly known as the narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist to saturated soils, often found along stream banks and in marshy areas. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense vegetation. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
