    "intro": "Goethea multiflora, commonly known as the mountain goethea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Goethea multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and delicate blooms."
