    "intro": "Galeorchis reichenbachii, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a rare and delicate member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. This terrestrial orchid typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Its roots are often covered in a dense, spongy mycorrhizal network, which aids in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range."
