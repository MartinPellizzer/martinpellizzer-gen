    "intro": "Gleichenia velata, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a thin, membranous cover."
