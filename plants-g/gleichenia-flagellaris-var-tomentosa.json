    "intro": "Gleichenia flagellaris var. tomentosa, commonly known as the tomentose chain fern, is a variant of the chain fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae, characterized by its creeping rhizome and fronds that are typically divided into segments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its long, narrow, and often hairy fronds that give it a velvety texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. The varietal form, tomentosa, is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering on the fronds, which aids in moisture retention."
