    "intro": "Geranium sebosum, commonly known as the roughleaf geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom from late spring to early fall. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils, often in woodland or rocky habitats. The leaves and stems are often covered in a waxy, powdery coating, giving the plant its common name."
