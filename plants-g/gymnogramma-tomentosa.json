    "intro": "Gymnogramma tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence, which gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows as a small, compact fern with fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of hair, contributing to its common name. Gymnogramma tomentosa is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
