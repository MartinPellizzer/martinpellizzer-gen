    "intro": "Glomera giluwensis, commonly known as the Giluwens mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its botanical features include strap-like leaves and a single, erect stem bearing a cluster of fragrant, violet-colored blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
