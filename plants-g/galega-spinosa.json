    "intro": "Galega spinosa, commonly known as goat's rue, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in stiff, spiny hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Botanically, it belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through root nodules."
