    "intro": "Galactia suberecta, commonly known as the upright milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical, dehiscent pods containing several elliptical seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Galactia suberecta plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with Rhizobium bacteria."
