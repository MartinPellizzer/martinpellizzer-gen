    "intro": "Gymnogramma veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor, forming dense mats. Gymnogramma veitchii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, well-drained environment."
