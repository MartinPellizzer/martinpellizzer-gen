    "intro": "Galium californicum var. crebrifolium, commonly known as the California bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and chaparral, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
