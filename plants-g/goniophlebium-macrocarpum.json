    "intro": "Goniophlebium macrocarpum, commonly known as the giant swamp fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to the wetlands of South America. It has long, strap-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, making it one of the tallest ferns in the world. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense stands in marshy areas. Its reproductive structures, including large, spore-bearing sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of its fronds. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
