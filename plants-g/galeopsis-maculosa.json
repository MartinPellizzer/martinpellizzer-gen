    "intro": "Galeopsis maculosa, commonly known as spotted horseweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Galeopsis maculosa is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings. It has a hairy texture and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
