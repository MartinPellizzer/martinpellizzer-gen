    "intro": "Geonoma cuneata subsp. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping geonoma, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground. The fronds are typically pinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture and a serrated margin. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in understory layers of rainforests. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitat."
