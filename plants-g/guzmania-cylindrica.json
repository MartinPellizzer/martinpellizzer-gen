    "intro": "Guzmania cylindrica, commonly known as the bottlebrush bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that surround a central spadix, giving it a unique and eye-catching appearance. The plant's rosette of narrow, waxy leaves forms a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a microhabitat for small organisms. Guzmania cylindrica thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. It is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its long-lasting blooms and ease of care."
