    "intro": "Gaultheria berberidifolia, commonly known as the alpine wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a dense, mat-like form. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, peppery flavor, making them an important food source for wildlife. Gaultheria berberidifolia is well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils."
