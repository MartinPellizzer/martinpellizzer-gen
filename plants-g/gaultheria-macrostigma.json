    "intro": "Gaultheria macrostigma, commonly known as the large-leaved wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and have a sharp, spicy flavor due to the presence of methyl salicylate. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and high-altitude areas. Gaultheria macrostigma is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in traditional medicine."
