    "intro": "Guajacum, commonly known as the mastic tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Burseraceae. It consists of two species, Guajacum ovalifolium and Guajacum officinale, both native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. The tree is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark and elliptical, leathery leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. The wood of the guajacum tree is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties, though it is now considered endangered due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
