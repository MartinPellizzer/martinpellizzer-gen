    "intro": "Gentiana ornata var. meiantha, commonly known as the meiantha gentian, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, often in alpine or subalpine meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense, woolly coating that helps retain moisture. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
