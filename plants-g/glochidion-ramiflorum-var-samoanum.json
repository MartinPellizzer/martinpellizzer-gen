    "intro": "Glochidion ramiflorum var. samoanum, commonly known as the Samoan glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
