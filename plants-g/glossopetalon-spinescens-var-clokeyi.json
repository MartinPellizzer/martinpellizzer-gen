    "intro": "Glossopetalon spinescens var. clokeyi, commonly known as the Clokey's spiny lily, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive spiny leaves and striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its foliage is covered in fine, sharp spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
