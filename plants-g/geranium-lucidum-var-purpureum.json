It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to deep purple. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
