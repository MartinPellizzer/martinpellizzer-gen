It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellowish in hue. Glossoloma velutinum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
