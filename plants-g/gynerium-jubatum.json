    "intro": "Gynerium jubatum, commonly known as the golden dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its root system is robust, allowing it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Gynerium jubatum is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
