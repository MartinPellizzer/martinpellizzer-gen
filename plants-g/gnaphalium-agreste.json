    "intro": "Gnaphalium agreste, commonly known as common cudweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Native to Europe, it is often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and open fields."
