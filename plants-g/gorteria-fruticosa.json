    "intro": "Gorteria fruticosa, commonly known as the yellow star flower, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are woody and somewhat succulent. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Gorteria fruticosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
