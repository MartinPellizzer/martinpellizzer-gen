    "intro": "Ginora, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Ginora is an annual herb that thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and ability to spread make it both a useful forage crop and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
