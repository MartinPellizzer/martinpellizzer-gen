    "intro": "Glossorhyncha inflata, commonly known as the inflated horned orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, inflated, horn-like structure that resembles a small, fleshy pouch. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture and indirect light. Its flowers are usually small and pale in color, which helps in attracting specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Glossorhyncha inflata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
