    "intro": "Gymnadenia rubra var. stiriaca, commonly known as the red gentian, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking red or orange-red flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. It produces showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its habitat."
