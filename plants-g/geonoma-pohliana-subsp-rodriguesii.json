    "intro": "Geonoma pohliana subsp. rodriguesii, commonly known as Rodrigues's geonoma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers that are not particularly showy. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
