    "intro": "Geonoma obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, ovate-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or rock surfaces. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
