    "intro": "Gaultheria setulosa, commonly known as the hairy waxmyrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, edible berries. These berries are often used in culinary applications and have a sharp, tart flavor. Gaultheria setulosa is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
