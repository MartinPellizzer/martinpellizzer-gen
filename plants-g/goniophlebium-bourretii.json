    "intro": "Goniophlebium bourretii, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread gradually across the forest floor. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, pointed lobes that give it a feathery appearance. Goniophlebium bourretii is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in humid forests."
