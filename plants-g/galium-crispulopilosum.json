    "intro": "Galium crispulopilosum, commonly known as the hairy leaf bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are usually ovate to elliptic, with a distinctive hairy texture on both surfaces. Small white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
