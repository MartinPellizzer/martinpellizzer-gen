It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces striking blue to lilac-colored flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while the stems are sturdy and branching. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific alpine conditions."
