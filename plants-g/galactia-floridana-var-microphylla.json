It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and stipules, which are small, leaf-like structures at the base of the leaf stalks. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. The species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
