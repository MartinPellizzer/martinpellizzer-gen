    "intro": "Genista ferox, commonly known as the fiery broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, leathery pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to various environments. Its rapid growth and invasive potential have led to its classification as a weed in some areas."
