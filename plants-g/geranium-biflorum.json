    "intro": "Geranium biflorum, commonly known as the twin-flowered geranium, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features upright stems that bear opposite, palmately lobed leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and adaptability to various growing conditions."
