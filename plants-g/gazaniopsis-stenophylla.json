    "intro": "Gazaniopsis stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gazania, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow and orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its narrow, strap-like leaves are a distinguishing feature, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Gazaniopsis stenophylla is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
