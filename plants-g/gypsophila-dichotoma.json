    "intro": "Gypsophila dichotoma, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss. Gypsophila dichotoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
