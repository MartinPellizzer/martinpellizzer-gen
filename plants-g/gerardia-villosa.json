    "intro": "Gerardia villosa, commonly known as the hairy gerardia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Gerardia villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
