    "intro": "Gattenhoffia pluvialis, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in brackish and freshwater environments. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow waters, such as estuaries and tidal pools, where it can absorb nutrients from the surrounding water. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Gattenhoffia pluvialis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microscopic life."
