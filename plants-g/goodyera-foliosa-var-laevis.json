    "intro": "Goodyera foliosa var. laevis, commonly known as the smooth-leafed lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiral arrangement of pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is notable for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
