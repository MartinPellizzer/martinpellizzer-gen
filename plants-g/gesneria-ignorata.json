    "intro": "Gesneria ignorata, commonly known as the dwarf gesneria, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features broad, glossy, dark green leaves that are often slightly wavy in appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in the spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria ignorata is popular among indoor gardeners due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
