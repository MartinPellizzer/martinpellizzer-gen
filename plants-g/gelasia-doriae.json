    "intro": "Gelasia doriae, commonly known as the Doria's gelasia, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gelasia doriae is considered a vulnerable species."
