    "intro": "Gentiana nyalamensis var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered gentian, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while the stem is erect and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
