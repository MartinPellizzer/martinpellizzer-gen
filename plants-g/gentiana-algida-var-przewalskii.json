    "intro": "Gentiana algida var. przewalskii, commonly known as the Przewalski's gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet petals and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has a short, upright stem with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It blooms during the summer months, producing clusters of showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
