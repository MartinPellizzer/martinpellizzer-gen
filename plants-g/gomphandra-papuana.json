    "intro": "Gomphandra papuana, commonly known as the Papuan gomphandra, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the highland regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in montane forests where it thrives in partial shade. Its botanical features include a short, woody stem and small, often hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
