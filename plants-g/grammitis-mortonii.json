    "intro": "Grammitis mortonii, commonly known as Morton's fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Australia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and rocky areas. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a feathery appearance. Grammitis mortonii plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
