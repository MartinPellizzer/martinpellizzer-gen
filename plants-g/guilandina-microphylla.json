    "intro": "Guilandina microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf legume or small-leaf guilandina, is a climbing leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. Its seeds are encased in a thick, fibrous pulp and are often used in traditional medicine. Guilandina microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential ecological benefits in nitrogen fixation."
