    "intro": "Grammica stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grammica, is a herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along streambanks. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Grammica stenolepis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
