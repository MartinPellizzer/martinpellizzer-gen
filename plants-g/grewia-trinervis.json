    "intro": "Grewia trinervis, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red gum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, round, red berries that are edible for some animals but generally not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Grewia trinervis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local communities."
