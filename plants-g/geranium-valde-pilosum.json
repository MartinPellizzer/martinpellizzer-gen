    "intro": "Geranium valde-pilosum, commonly known as the hairy geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically palmately lobed and covered in fine, hairy textures, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
