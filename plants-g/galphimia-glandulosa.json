    "intro": "Galphimia glandulosa, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to Central America and northern South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but generally not for humans. Galphimia glandulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
