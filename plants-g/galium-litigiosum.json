    "intro": "Galium litigiosum, commonly known as bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground, producing small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces, and it is characterized by its ability to spread through stolons. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium litigiosum is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
