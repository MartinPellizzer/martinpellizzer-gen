It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive, creeping rhizome with tightly packed, lance-shaped leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia borne on the underside of the leaves. Gleichenia montaguei is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
