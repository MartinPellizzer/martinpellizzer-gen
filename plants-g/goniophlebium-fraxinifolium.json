    "intro": "Goniophlebium fraxinifolium, commonly known as the Fraxinifolium fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
