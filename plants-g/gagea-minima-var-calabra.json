    "intro": "Gagea minima var. calabra, commonly known as the Calabrian dwarf lily, is a small perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the local flora's biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
