    "intro": "Galium sylvestre subsp. alpestre, commonly known as alpine woodryard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in late summer, which are typically arranged in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to high-altitude conditions with cool temperatures and limited nutrients."
