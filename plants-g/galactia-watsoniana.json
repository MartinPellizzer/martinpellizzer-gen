    "intro": "Galactia watsoniana, commonly known as the Watson's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, butterfly-pollinated flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Galactia watsoniana is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic to some animals."
