    "intro": "Gentiana fetisowii, commonly known as the Tibetan gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom during the summer months. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, helping to retain moisture in its harsh environment. Gentiana fetisowii is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its traditional uses in herbal medicine."
