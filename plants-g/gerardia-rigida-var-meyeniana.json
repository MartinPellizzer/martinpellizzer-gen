    "intro": "Gerardia rigida var. meyeniana, commonly known as the rigid gerardia, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Its flowers are typically pale blue or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This variety is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
