    "intro": "Goodyera novembrilis, commonly known as the November maidenhair, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces aerial roots that help it absorb moisture from the air. Goodyera novembrilis is a low-growing epiphyte, often found on the trunks or branches of trees in humid climates."
