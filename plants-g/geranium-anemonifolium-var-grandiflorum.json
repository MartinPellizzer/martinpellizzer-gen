    "intro": "Geranium anemonifolium var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble those of an anemone, giving it its species name. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
