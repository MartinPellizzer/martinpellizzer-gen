    "intro": "Gagea villosa subsp. hervieri, commonly known as the hairy gagea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and bears small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to naturalize. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name."
