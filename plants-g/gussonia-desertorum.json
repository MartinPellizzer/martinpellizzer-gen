It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Gussonia desertorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging conditions."
