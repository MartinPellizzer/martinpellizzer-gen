    "intro": "Gymnopteris decurrens, commonly known as the running fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Gymnopteris decurrens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
