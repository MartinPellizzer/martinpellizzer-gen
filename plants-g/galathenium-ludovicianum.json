    "intro": "Galathenium ludovicianum, commonly known as the Florida holly or the Florida beauty, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, often found in coastal dunes and sandy habitats. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native range."
