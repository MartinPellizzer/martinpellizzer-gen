    "intro": "Graphephorum nutans, commonly known as the nodding fern, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, drooping inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant has slender, wiry stems that often trail along the ground, forming a dense mat. Its small, green leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. Graphephorum nutans is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
