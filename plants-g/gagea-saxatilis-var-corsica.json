    "intro": "Gagea saxatilis var. corsica, commonly known as Corsican rock garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky, limestone-rich soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a dense umbel, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the bulbs are small, often used in traditional herbal medicine. This variety is noted for its resilience and is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
