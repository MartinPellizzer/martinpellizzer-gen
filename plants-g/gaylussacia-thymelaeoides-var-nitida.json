    "intro": "Gaylussacia thymelaeoides var. nitida, commonly known as the glossy alpenstrife, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that provide striking visual contrast in the landscape. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are clustered in racemes. These flowers are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along stream banks."
