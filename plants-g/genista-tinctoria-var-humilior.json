It features slender, wiry stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in dye production, it is appreciated in both horticulture and botanical studies."
