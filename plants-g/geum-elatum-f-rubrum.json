    "intro": "Geum elatum f. rubrum, commonly known as the red-flowered avens, is a botanical variant of the avens plant characterized by its striking red petals. It is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in woodland and meadow habitats. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branched. The flowers, which bloom in early summer, are borne in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
