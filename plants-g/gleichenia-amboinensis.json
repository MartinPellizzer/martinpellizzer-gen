    "intro": "Gleichenia amboinensis, commonly known as the Amboina spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is a terrestrial, epiphytic, or lithophytic plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive, creeping rhizome with closely spaced, lance-shaped fronds. Its leaves are usually dimorphic, with the sterile fronds being shorter and the fertile fronds bearing spore-producing structures. Gleichenia amboinensis is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in humid forests and on rock faces."
