    "intro": "Gyranthera darienensis, commonly known as the Darien gyranthera, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has simple, alternate leaves with a glossy surface and emits a subtle, sweet scent. It is typically found growing in shaded, humid environments along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
