    "intro": "Gyrostachys bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often appearing in clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gyrostachys bicolor is an annual herb that blooms from spring to summer, adding vibrant color to its native habitat."
