    "intro": "Gaultheria gracilipes, commonly known as the slender wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Andes mountains in South America. It typically grows at high altitudes, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by edible berries that are dark red when mature. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive aromatic scent, especially when crushed. Gaultheria gracilipes is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its use in traditional medicine."
