    "intro": "Gaultheria capitata var. crassiramea, commonly known as the broad-leaf wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in areas with rich, acidic soil. The plant features dense clusters of small, dark green leaves and produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring. Following flowering, it develops bright red berries that are edible and have a distinctive minty flavor. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
