    "intro": "Gaultheria consobrina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wintergreen, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces bell-shaped, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, red berries in the fall. Its leaves contain aromatic compounds, including methyl salicylate, which gives the plant its distinctive wintergreen scent. Gaultheria consobrina is often found in moist, acidic soils and is adapted to thrive in shaded forest environments."
