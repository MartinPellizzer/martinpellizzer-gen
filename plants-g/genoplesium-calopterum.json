    "intro": "Genoplesium calopterum, commonly known as the golden spider-orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
