    "intro": "Gladiolus somalensis, commonly known as the Somali gladiolus, is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves and showy, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces vibrant flowers in a range of colors, including red, yellow, and white, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
