    "intro": "Goodyera repens, commonly known as the lesser pigmy orchid, is a low-growing terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It features a dense mat of dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white with a faintly colored lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Goodyera repens is notable for its ability to form extensive colonies through rhizomes, making it a persistent and widespread ground cover in its native habitat."
