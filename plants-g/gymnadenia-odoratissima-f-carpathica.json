    "intro": "Gymnadenia odoratissima f. carpathica, commonly known as the Carpathian fragrant orchid, is a rare and beautiful orchid species native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny meadows and grasslands with well-drained soil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate, ephemeral blooms that appear in late summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
