    "intro": "Gymnandropogon annulatus, commonly known as the ringed bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that often form a ring-like structure, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, blue-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in panicles. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Gymnandropogon annulatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
