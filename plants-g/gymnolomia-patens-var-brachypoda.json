    "intro": "Gymnolomia patens var. brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed gymnolomia, is a variant of the gymnolomia species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
