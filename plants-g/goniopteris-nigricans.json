    "intro": "Goniopteris nigricans, commonly known as the black-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that are often dark green with a velvety texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and along riverbanks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Goniopteris nigricans plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
