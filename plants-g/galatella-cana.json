    "intro": "Galatella cana, commonly known as the white marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It features a slender, upright stem that bears several narrow, lance-shaped leaves arranged along its length. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters during the late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, swampy environments. Galatella cana is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native wetlands."
