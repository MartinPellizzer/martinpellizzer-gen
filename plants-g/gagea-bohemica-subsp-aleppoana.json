It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers. The plant is adapted to rocky and dry environments, often growing in limestone soils. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive in arid conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and early spring blooming habit."
