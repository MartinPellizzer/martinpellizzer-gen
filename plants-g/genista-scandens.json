    "intro": "Genista scandens, commonly known as the climbing broom, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in open, sunny environments such as woodlands and coastal areas. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. Genista scandens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
