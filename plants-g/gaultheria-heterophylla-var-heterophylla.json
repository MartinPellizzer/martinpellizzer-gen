    "intro": "Gaultheria heterophylla var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable wintergreen, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces edible, dark red berries that are rich in aromatic oils, giving them their distinctive wintergreen scent. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
