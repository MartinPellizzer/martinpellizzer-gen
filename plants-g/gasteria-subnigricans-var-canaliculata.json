    "intro": "Gasteria subnigricans var. canaliculata, commonly known as the Zulu candle or Zulu torch, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves with prominent white or pale veins. The leaves are often adorned with small, shallow channels, giving them a unique, textured appearance. It produces upright, candle-like inflorescences with white to pale pink flowers during the cooler months. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its drought tolerance and attractive foliage."
