It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant features strap-like, dark green leaves that are often marked with silver or white veins. It produces showy, colorful bracts that can range from red to orange, yellow, or pink, depending on the variety. Guzmania stricta thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil for optimal growth."
