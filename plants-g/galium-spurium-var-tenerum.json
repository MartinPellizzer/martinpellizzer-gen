    "intro": "Galium spurium var. tenerum, commonly known as woolly bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its delicate appearance and ability to spread through runners make it a common ornamental and ground-cover plant."
