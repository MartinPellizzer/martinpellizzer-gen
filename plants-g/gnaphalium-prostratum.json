    "intro": "Gnaphalium prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate everlasting, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, often forming a mat-like growth pattern. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
