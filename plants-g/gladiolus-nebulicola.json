    "intro": "Gladiolus nebulicola, commonly known as the clouded gladiolus, is a rare and striking member of the Iridaceae family. It is native to South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant features tall, slender stems with large, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, often with intricate patterns. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
