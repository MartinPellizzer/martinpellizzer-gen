    "intro": "Gomphocarpus longipes, commonly known as the longipes milkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are arranged in racemes, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal."
