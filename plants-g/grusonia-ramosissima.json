    "intro": "Grusonia ramosissima, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has compound leaves that are alternate and pinnate, with small, ovate leaflets. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
