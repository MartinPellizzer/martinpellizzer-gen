    "intro": "Goodyera andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's filmy fern, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that give it a distinctive, almost ethereal appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in late spring, and it is often found in association with other epiphytic plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Goodyera andersonii is considered a species of conservation concern."
