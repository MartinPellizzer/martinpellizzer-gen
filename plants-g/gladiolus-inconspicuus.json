    "intro": "Gladiolus inconspicuus, commonly known as the inconspicuous gladiolus, is a species native to South Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, erect stems. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
