    "intro": "Galium pumilum subsp. papillosum, commonly known as the hairy bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. Small, white flowers are borne in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
