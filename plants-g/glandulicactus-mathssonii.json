    "intro": "Glandulicactus mathssonii, commonly known as the Mathsson's globose cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical or slightly cylindrical stem that is often ribbed and covered with short, woolly spines. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Glandulicactus mathssonii is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
