    "intro": "Gossypium calycotum, commonly known as the desert cotton or Mexican cotton, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other cotton species and hibiscus plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, and its flowers are typically pink or white. Its fibrous seeds are encased in a fluffy, cotton-like covering, which gives it its common name. Gossypium calycotum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils."
