    "intro": "Grusonia anteojoensis, commonly known as the Anteojo's grass. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family, characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. Native to the high Andean regions of South America, it thrives in cool, moist environments at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
