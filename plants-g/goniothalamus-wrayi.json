    "intro": "Goniothalamus wrayi, commonly known as the Wray's goniathalamus, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain multiple seeds, aiding in its dispersal by animals. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
