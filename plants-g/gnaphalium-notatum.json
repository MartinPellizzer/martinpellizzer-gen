    "intro": "Gnaphalium notatum, commonly known as common cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features fine, silver-haired leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Gnaphalium notatum is also noted for its ability to produce a mild, aromatic scent, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
