    "intro": "Geranium simense var. repens, commonly known as the creeping geranium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming from spring to autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
