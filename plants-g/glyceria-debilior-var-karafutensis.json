    "intro": "Glyceria debilior var. karafutensis, commonly known as the Karafuto grass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, preferring moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and ability to thrive in temperate climates. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
