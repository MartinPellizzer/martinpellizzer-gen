    "intro": "Gomphocarpus asperifolius, commonly known as the rough-leaved milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant is part of the Apocynaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, releasing hairy, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant is often found in arid or semi-arid regions and is adapted to thrive in poor soils."
