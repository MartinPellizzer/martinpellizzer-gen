    "intro": "Galium spurium f. segreanum, commonly known as the Segrean bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream sides. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy. It has a creeping growth habit with slender stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
