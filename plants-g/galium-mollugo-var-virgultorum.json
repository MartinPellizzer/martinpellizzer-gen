    "intro": "Galium mollugo var. virgultorum, commonly known as lesser bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and a creeping rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its presence often indicates a rich, undisturbed soil environment."
