    "intro": "Genista dasycarpa, commonly known as the hairy-fruited broom, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features slender, wiry stems covered in fine, hairy foliage, and it produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. Its fruit is a dry, hairy capsule that contains several seeds, aiding in its dispersal by wind. Genista dasycarpa is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils."
