It features small, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to cream, often with a slight greenish tinge. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun to partial shade conditions. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in native gardens for its compact growth habit and seasonal flowering."
