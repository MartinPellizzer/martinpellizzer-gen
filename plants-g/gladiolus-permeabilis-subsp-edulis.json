    "intro": "Gladiolus permeabilis subsp. edulis, commonly known as the edible gladiolus, is a rare and less commonly studied subspecies of the gladiolus genus. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant features striking, sword-shaped leaves and tall, colorful inflorescences that resemble a sword, hence its common name. While primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes, it has been occasionally used in traditional cuisines for its edible tubers. Its botanical significance lies in its unique genetic makeup and potential for agricultural adaptation."
