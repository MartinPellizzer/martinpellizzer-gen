    "intro": "Gomphocarpus setosus, commonly known as the hairy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Gomphocarpus setosus is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
