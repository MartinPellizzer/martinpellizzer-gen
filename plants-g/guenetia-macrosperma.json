    "intro": "Guenetia macrosperma, commonly known as the giant spider orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length, with intricate patterns of purple and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators such as bees and wasps. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Guenetia macrosperma is considered a vulnerable species."
