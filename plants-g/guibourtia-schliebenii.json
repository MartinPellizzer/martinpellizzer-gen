    "intro": "Guibourtia schliebenii, commonly known as the African teak or African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to West and Central Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for furniture and musical instruments. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated pods containing flat, round seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to overharvesting, it is also classified as an endangered species in some regions."
