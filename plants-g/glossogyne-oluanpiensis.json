    "intro": "Glossogyne oluanpiensis, commonly known as the mountain gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the rainforests of northern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its rough, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Glossogyne oluanpiensis is adapted to the humid, nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat and plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
