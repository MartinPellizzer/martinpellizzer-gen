    "intro": "Gypsophila nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed sweetpea, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems that rise from a basal rosette of small, gray-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
