    "intro": "Gymnopsis kunthiana, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gymnopsis kunthiana is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its latex contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
