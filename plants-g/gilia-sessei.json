    "intro": "Gilia sessei, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Gilia sessei plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
