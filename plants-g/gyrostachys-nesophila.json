    "intro": "Gyrostachys nesophila, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Gyrostachys nesophila has small, milky sap that is toxic to some animals, providing a natural defense mechanism."
