    "intro": "Grindelia squarrosa, commonly known as the desert gumweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its resinous sap contains compounds that have been used traditionally by Native American tribes for medicinal purposes. Grindelia squarrosa plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
