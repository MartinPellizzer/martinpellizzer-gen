It is characterized by its distinctive, upright fronds that often have a rough, textured appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates like soil or rock. The leaves are usually divided into lance-shaped segments, giving the plant its unique, fern-like appearance."
