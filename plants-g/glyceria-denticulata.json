    "intro": "Glyceria denticulata, commonly known as the toothed glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically arranged in panicle-like clusters. Glyceria denticulata thrives in moist soils and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
