    "intro": "Gomphrena floribunda, commonly known as the clustered gomphrena, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its showy, spiky inflorescences that come in a variety of colors, including pink, red, and purple. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often used in ornamental gardening due to their long-lasting blooms. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Gomphrena floribunda is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
