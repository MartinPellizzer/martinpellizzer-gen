    "intro": "Gaultheria brachybotrys, commonly known as the dwarf wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Gaultheria brachybotrys thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native habitat."
