    "intro": "Gladiolus pottsii, commonly known as the Potts' gladiolus, is a rare and striking member of the Iridaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of South Africa, this plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, colorful flowers that bloom in late summer. The inflorescence consists of multiple spikes of flowers, often with contrasting colors and intricate patterns. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a challenging but rewarding plant for cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
