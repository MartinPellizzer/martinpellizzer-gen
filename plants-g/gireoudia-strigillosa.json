    "intro": "Gireoudia strigillosa, commonly known as the roughleaf gireoudia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Gireoudia strigillosa is valued in traditional medicine for its potential medicinal properties."
