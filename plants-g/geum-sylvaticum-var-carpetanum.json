    "intro": "Geum sylvaticum var. carpetanum, commonly known as the carpeted avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
