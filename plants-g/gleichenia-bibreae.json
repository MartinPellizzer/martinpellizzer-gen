    "intro": "Gleichenia bibreae, commonly known as the Bibr\u00e9a fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae and is characterized by its long, narrow, and often segmented fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its roots to anchor itself while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water in humid environments. Gleichenia bibreae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, moist gardens."
