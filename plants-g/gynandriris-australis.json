    "intro": "Gynandriris australis, commonly known as the Australian sandalwood, is a species of plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in sandy soils and coastal environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Gynandriris australis is valued for its aromatic wood, which has been used traditionally by Indigenous communities."
