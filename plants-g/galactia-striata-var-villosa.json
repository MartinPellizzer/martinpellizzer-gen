    "intro": "Galactia striata var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial legume characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions, and it is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
