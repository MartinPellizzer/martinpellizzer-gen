    "intro": "Geranium latum, commonly known as the broadleaf geranium, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a distinctive notched or serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. Geranium latum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
