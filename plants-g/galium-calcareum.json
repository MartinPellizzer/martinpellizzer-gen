    "intro": "Galium calcareum, commonly known as limestone bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in calcareous soils, often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and rocky areas. The plant features slender, ascending stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are hairy and have a slightly waxy texture. Its small, white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. Galium calcareum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
