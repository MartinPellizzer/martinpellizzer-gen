    "intro": "Goodenia geniculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf goodenia, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry heathlands. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Goodenia geniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
