    "intro": "Gentiana stictantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and alpine meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The genus Gentiana is part of the family Gentianaceae, known for its showy, often blue or purple flowers."
