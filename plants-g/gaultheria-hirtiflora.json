    "intro": "Gaultheria hirtiflora, commonly known as the hairy-leaved wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for both humans and wildlife. Gaultheria hirtiflora thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its aromatic leaves and berries make it a valuable plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
