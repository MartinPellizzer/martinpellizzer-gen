    "intro": "Galactia sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparseflower milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters. Its seed pods are slender and cylindrical, containing several kidney-shaped seeds. Galactia sparsiflora plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in restoration ecology due to its hardy nature."
