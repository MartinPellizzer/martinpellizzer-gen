    "intro": "Gymnogramma hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid kidney fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often used in horticulture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds. Gymnogramma hybrida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
