    "intro": "Grammitis uapensis, commonly known as the Uapaca fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is native to regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Tanzania and Kenya. Grammitis uapensis thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in moist forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
