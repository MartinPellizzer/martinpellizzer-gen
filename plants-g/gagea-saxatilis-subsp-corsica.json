    "intro": "Gagea saxatilis subsp. corsica, commonly known as Corsican gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open woodlands or alpine meadows. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, and it is often found in crevices or on slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
