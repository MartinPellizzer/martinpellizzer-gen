    "intro": "Gethyllis acaulis, commonly known as the Cape iron plant, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its dense, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in umbels, and bloom in late winter to early spring. Gethyllis acaulis is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions."
