    "intro": "Gleichenia venosa, commonly known as the veined maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinct veining pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across suitable habitats. Gleichenia venosa is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
