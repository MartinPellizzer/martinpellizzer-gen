    "intro": "Gentiana verna subsp. brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-stemmed gentian, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in early spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact stems compared to the typical form of G. verna. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky slopes. The plant's foliage consists of basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs."
