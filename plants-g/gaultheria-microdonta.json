    "intro": "Gaultheria microdonta, commonly known as the dwarf wax myrtle, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically reaches heights of less than 30 cm, with dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and silver-white underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Gaultheria microdonta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
