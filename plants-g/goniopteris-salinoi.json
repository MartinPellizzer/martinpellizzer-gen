It thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in wetlands and tidal marshes. The plant has long, slender fronds with a distinctive, feather-like structure. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Goniopteris salinoi plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
