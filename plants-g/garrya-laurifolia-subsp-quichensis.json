    "intro": "Garrya laurifolia subsp. quichensis, commonly known as the Quich\u00e9 holly, is a member of the Aquifoliaceae family and is native to Central America. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in conservation and landscape settings."
