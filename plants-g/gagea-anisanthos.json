It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. It produces small, clustered berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals.
