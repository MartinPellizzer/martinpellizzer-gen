    "intro": "Galinsoga longipes, commonly known as common galinsoga, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers with five petals, which are followed by small, spherical fruits called schizocarps. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along creek banks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a weed in many agricultural areas."
