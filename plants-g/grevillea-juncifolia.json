It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and full sun exposure. It is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Grevillea juncifolia is also an important food source for native pollinators such as birds and insects."
