    "intro": "Gesneria grandis, commonly known as the giant gesneria, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces vibrant orange-red flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom during the warm season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria grandis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
