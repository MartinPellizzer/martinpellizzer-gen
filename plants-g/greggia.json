    "intro": "Greggia, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible stems. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom above the water, often in the early morning. Greggia is known for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving waters, making it a common sight in ponds and marshes. Its symbolic significance in various cultures further highlights its botanical and cultural importance."
