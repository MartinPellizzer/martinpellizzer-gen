    "intro": "Grewia megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant yellow globemallow, is a deciduous shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has simple, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. Its fruits are dry, capsule-like structures that split open to release small, smooth seeds. Grewia megalocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained, sandy soils."
