    "intro": "Gunnera talamancana, commonly known as the Talamancan giant water shield, is a striking plant native to the wetlands of Central America. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, providing a unique visual presence in its habitat. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy areas and along riverbanks. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to trap moisture and protect against herbivory. Gunnera talamancana plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
