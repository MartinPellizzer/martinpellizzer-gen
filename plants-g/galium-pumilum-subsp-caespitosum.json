    "intro": "Galium pumilum subsp. caespitosum, commonly known as the tufted bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems, with small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in umbellate clusters and are visited by various insects, contributing to its ecological role. The subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
