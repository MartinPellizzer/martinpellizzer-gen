    "intro": "Gynoxys baccharoides, commonly known as the red-barked tree, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and broad, ovate leaves that are often glossy in appearance. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
