    "intro": "Geonoma decussata, commonly known as the crossleaf fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, pinnate fronds with a cross-shaped arrangement of pinnae. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are often dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. Geonoma decussata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
