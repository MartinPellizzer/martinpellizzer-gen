    "intro": "Grammitis pozuzoensis, commonly known as the Pozuzo fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, epiphytic growth habit on tree trunks and branches. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically clustered in dense, compact rosettes. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Grammitis pozuzoensis is of significant interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution."
