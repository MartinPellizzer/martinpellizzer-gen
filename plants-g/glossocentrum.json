    "intro": "Glossocentrum, commonly known as the orchid bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. Glossocentrum species are characterized by their striking, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. They typically grow as epiphytes, attaching themselves to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
