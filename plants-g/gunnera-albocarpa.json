    "intro": "Gunnera albocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited gunnera, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Gunneraceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter. The plant produces showy, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by bright yellow bracts, which attract pollinators such as beetles and flies. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in high-altitude environments. Gunnera albocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens with moist, well-drained soil and cool climates."
