    "intro": "Geranium glaucum, commonly known as the blue geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems covered with a fine, powdery blue-gray coating, which gives it its characteristic appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture and a bluish-green hue. Geranium glaucum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
