    "intro": "Gagea transversalis, commonly known as the transverse gagea, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon, where it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and bears small, white to pale blue flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are fleshy and serve as storage organs, enabling the plant to survive periods of dormancy. Gagea transversalis is notable for its delicate appearance and its role in local ecosystems as a food source for various insects and small mammals."
