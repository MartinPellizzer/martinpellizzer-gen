    "intro": "Gaylussacia ursina, commonly known as the bearberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible for humans but are toxic to livestock. Gaylussacia ursina thrives in acidic, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands."
