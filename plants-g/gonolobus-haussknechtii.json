    "intro": "Gonolobus haussknechtii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bladdernut, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. It is a perennial shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Jamaica and the Bahamas. The plant has small, showy flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, and the plant often grows in moist, shaded environments. The seeds are enclosed in a hairy, inflated pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
