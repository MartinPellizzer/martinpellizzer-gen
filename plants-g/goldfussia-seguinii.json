    "intro": "Goldfussia seguinii, commonly known as the Seguin's goldfussia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
