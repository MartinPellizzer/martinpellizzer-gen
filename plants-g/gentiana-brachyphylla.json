    "intro": "Gentiana brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-leaved gentian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are short and broad, often arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are upright and branching. Gentiana brachyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
