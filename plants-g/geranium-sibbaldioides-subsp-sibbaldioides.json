    "intro": "Geranium sibbaldioides subsp. sibbaldioides, commonly known as the sibbaldioides geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, and its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, often blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged flowering period."
