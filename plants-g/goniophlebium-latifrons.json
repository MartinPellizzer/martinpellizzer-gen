    "intro": "Goniophlebium latifrons, commonly known as the broad-fronded liverwort, is a species of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant's leaves are usually broad and arranged in a rosette pattern, with a distinct midrib and a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of the leaves. Goniophlebium latifrons plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitats."
