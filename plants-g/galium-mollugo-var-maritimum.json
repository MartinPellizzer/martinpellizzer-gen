    "intro": "Galium mollugo var. maritimum, commonly known as sea chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and tidal influences. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. Sea chickweed is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
