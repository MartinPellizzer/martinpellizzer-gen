It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spathaceous inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
