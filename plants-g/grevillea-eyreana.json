    "intro": "Grevillea eyreana, commonly known as the Eyrean waratah, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Australia. It is characterized by its striking, cone-shaped inflorescence composed of numerous small, petal-like bracts. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with woody stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces vibrant red or orange flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Grevillea eyreana is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native environment."
