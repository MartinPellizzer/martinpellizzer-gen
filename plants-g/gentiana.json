    "intro": "Gentiana, commonly known as the gentian, is a genus of about 400 species of flowering plants in the family Gentianaceae. These plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe, Asia, and North America. Gentiana species are typically herbaceous, with striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. They often grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and mountain meadows. The flowers are characterized by their radial symmetry and often have five to seven petals."
