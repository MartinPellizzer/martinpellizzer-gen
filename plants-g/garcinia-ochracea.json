    "intro": "Garcinia ochracea, commonly known as the yellow garcinia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale yellow bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to orange-red berries containing a single seed. Garcinia ochracea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its growth habit makes it suitable for cultivation in warm, humid climates."
