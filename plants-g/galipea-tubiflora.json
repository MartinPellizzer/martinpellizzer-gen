    "intro": "Galipea tubiflora, commonly known as the Mexican sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to dry and hot climates. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss. Galipea tubiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
