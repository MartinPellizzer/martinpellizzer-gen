It features upright stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive, hairy appearance. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically rounded with a waxy texture and a slightly hairy surface. Geranium carnosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to rock gardens and dry landscapes."
