    "intro": "Gentiana calycosa subsp. asepala, commonly known as the narrowleaf gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. The plant is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive waxy coating. The subspecies is notable for its relatively small size and its role in supporting local pollinators."
