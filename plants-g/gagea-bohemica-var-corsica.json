    "intro": "Gagea bohemica var. corsica, commonly known as Corsican spring beauty, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features delicate, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of star-shaped, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring well-drained conditions. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in cooler, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
