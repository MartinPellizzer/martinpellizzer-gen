    "intro": "Geranium forrestii, commonly known as the Forster's geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features basal leaves that are heart-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Geranium forrestii is often found in open woodlands and rocky habitats, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
