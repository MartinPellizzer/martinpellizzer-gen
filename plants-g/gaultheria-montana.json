    "intro": "Gaultheria montana, commonly known as the mountain tea or the evergreen wintergreen, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves contain high concentrations of methyl salicylate, which gives it a distinctive wintergreen scent. Gaultheria montana is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
