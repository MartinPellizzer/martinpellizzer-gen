    "intro": "Galium carterae, commonly known as Carter's bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Galium carterae is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to arid environments."
