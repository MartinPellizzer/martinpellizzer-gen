    "intro": "Griseocereus, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a genus of cacti native to Mexico and the southwestern United States. These plants are characterized by their cylindrical or club-shaped stems, which are often covered in a whitish or grayish coating. The stems are typically ribbed and can store water, allowing the plant to survive in arid environments. Griseocereus species produce small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking visual contrast to their otherwise muted appearance. Due to their slow growth and unique appearance, they are popular among cactus enthusiasts and require well-draining soil and minimal watering."
