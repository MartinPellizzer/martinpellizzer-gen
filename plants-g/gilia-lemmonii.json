    "intro": "Gilia lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky habitats, such as cliffs and canyon walls, where it thrives in full sun. Its stems are often branched and covered with fine hairs, and the leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. Gilia lemmonii plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
