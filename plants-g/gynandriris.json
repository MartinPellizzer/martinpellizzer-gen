    "intro": "Gynandriris, commonly known as the \"butterfly orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers that resemble the wings of butterflies, hence its common name. The plants typically have slender stems and are native to regions in South America, particularly Brazil. Gynandriris species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral morphology and their role in the ecosystems of tropical rainforests."
