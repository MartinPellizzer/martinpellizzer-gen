    "intro": "Gastrochilus loerzingii var. bandarensis, commonly known as the Bandarans Island orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
