    "intro": "Globimetula oreophila, commonly known as the mountain globemetula, is a rare and specialized plant species found in high-altitude environments. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it adapts to cold and nutrient-poor conditions. Its small, white flowers are clustered in spherical umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Globimetula oreophila is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health in mountainous regions."
