    "intro": "Geum rivale, commonly known as water avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming from June to August. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in wet environments. Geum rivale is often found in stream banks, marshes, and other damp areas, contributing to the ecological diversity of such habitats."
