    "intro": "Galium boreale var. hispidulum, commonly known as the northern bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features slender, hairy stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered with fine, stiff hairs. Galium boreale var. hispidulum is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats."
