    "intro": "Gerardia sopubia, commonly known as the golden star, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble stars, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows in compact clusters, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Gerardia sopubia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
