    "intro": "Geranium collinum var. eglandulosum, commonly known as the smooth geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glandless, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
