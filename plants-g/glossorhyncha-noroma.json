It is characterized by its striking, elongated flower spikes that bear numerous small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. The flowers often bloom in late spring or early summer, adding vibrant color to the forest canopy."
