    "intro": "Gesneria tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gesneria, is a species of flowering plant in the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This evergreen shrub is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria tenella is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
