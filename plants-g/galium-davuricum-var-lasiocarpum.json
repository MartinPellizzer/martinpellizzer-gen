    "intro": "Galium davuricum var. lasiocarpum, commonly known as the downy bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, often hairy stems that lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and covered with fine, soft hairs. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature."
