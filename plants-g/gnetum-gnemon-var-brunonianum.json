    "intro": "Gnetum gnemon var. brunonianum, commonly known as the Bornean gnetum, is a member of the Gnetophyta division, characterized by its unique combination of gymnosperm and angiosperm traits. It is a tropical evergreen tree or shrub native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features scale-like leaves arranged in opposite pairs, and its cones are typically small and borne in clusters. It produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and ecological role in tropical rainforests."
