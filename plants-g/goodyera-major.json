    "intro": "Goodyera major, commonly known as the giant bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, dark green leaves and its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and pine forests. Its flowers are typically white or pale green with intricate patterns, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Goodyera major is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific environmental conditions to survive."
