    "intro": "Gumira grossa, commonly known as the broad-leaved gumira, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
