    "intro": "Grastidium alticola, commonly known as the highland grass. It is a small, herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of South America. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or pale yellow, arranged in dense clusters. Grastidium alticola is adapted to thrive in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain."
