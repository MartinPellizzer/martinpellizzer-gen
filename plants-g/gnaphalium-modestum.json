    "intro": "Gnaphalium modestum, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow florets arranged in dense clusters, often surrounded by bracts that give it a fluffy appearance. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Gnaphalium modestum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
