    "intro": "Gleichenia subpectinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chain fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of Asia and Australia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Gleichenia subpectinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
