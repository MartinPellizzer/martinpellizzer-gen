    "intro": "Gilia breweri, commonly known as the Chihuahuan Desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in arid environments, such as rocky soils and desert plains, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Gilia breweri plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists studying desert flora."
