    "intro": "Greenwoodiella micrantha var. garayana, commonly known as the Garayana greenwoodiella, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The flowers are borne in dense clusters and are usually a striking combination of blue and purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered plant in its native range."
