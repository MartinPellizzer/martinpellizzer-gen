    "intro": "Galium anguineum, commonly known as sticky willow or sweet willow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its stems and leaves are often covered with a fine, sticky pubescence, giving it its common name. Galium anguineum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
