    "intro": "Gordonia densifolia, commonly known as the denseleaf beech, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that remain dense and compact throughout the growing season. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, fleshy berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at higher elevations. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is sensitive to environmental changes."
