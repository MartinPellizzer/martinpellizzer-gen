    "intro": "Geanthus longifolius, commonly known as the longleaf geanthus, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
