    "intro": "Galarhoeus trichotomus, commonly known as the three-branched willow, is a deciduous shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces catkins as its primary floral structure, which are wind-pollinated and contain both male and female flowers. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin layers, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Galarhoeus trichotomus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
