    "intro": "Grevillea burrowa, commonly known as Burrow's grevillea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are dark green and often have a reddish or brownish tinge along the edges. The plant produces vibrant, bottlebrush-like inflorescences in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Grevillea burrowa is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to provide habitat for local wildlife."
