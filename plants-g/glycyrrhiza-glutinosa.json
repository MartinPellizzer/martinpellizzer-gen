    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza glutinosa, commonly known as licorice, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Glycyrrhiza glutinosa is known for its sweet, licorice-like flavor due to the presence of glycyrrhizin, a compound that also contributes to its medicinal uses. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its roots, which are harvested for commercial purposes."
