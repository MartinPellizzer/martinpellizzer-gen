    "intro": "Gagea burnatii, commonly known as the Burnat's spring beauty, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, showcasing its adaptation to alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gagea burnatii is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
