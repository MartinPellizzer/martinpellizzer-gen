    "intro": "Grindelia nana columbiana, commonly known as the Columbian dwarf gumweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flower heads. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and the plant produces a sticky resin that can be released when the stems are broken. Grindelia nana columbiana is adapted to arid environments and is often used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
