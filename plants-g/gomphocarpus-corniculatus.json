    "intro": "Gomphocarpus corniculatus, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive horn-shaped seed pods, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a notable feature of its botanical makeup. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing along roadsides and in open grasslands."
