    "intro": "Galega, commonly known as goat's rue, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect, branched stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods. Galega is often found in dry, calcareous soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings. It has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
