    "intro": "Gomphia australiana, commonly known as the Australian grass tree, is a unique plant native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is a perennial herb with a distinctive appearance, featuring a dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall, flowering spike that bears small, greenish-white flowers, which are pollinated by insects. Gomphia australiana is adapted to fire-prone environments and can regenerate after bushfires. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat and food source for native wildlife."
