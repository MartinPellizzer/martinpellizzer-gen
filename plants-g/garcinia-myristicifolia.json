    "intro": "Garcinia myristicifolia, commonly known as the Malabar tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy dark green surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody pods containing several seeds. Its fruit, which is typically harvested when mature, has a sour taste and is used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. Garcinia myristicifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
