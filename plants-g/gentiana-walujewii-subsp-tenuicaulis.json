    "intro": "Gentiana walujewii subsp. tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, often adorned with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in terminal racemes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
