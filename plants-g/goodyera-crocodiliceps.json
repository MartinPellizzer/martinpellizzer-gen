    "intro": "Goodyera crocodiliceps, commonly known as the crocodile's mouth orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, waxy leaves that resemble the scales of a crocodile, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, often with a faintly scented aroma. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Goodyera crocodiliceps is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
