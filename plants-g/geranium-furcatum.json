    "intro": "Geranium furcatum, commonly known as the cat's paw geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble a cat's paw, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Geranium furcatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
