    "intro": "Gaertnera quadriseta var. hebepoda, commonly known as the hairy leafed gaertnera, is a shrub native to southern China. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape and are often arranged in whorls along the stems. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which are borne on short pedicels. This plant is often grown for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained, acidic soils."
