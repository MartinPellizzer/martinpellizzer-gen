    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza glabra var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular licorice, is a variant of the licorice plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and dense clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces long, cylindrical roots that are rich in glycyrrhizin, a compound known for its sweet taste and medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, often growing in dry, temperate climates. This variety is valued in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and expectorant effects."
