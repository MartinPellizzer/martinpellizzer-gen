    "intro": "Grewia leucodiscus, commonly known as the white disc grewia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white, five-lobed flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often borne at the ends of branches. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature. The plant is often found in woodland and savanna habitats, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
