    "intro": "Goniophlebium cambricum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters and has finely divided, floating leaves. Its botanical features include a short, creeping rhizome and small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling insect populations and contributing to aquatic biodiversity."
