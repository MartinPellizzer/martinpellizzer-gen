Its flowers are predominantly yellow and orange, arranged in dense, spherical clusters that resemble burning embers. The plant is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Gynophyge has a short flowering period, typically during the summer months, and is known for its strong, spicy fragrance.
