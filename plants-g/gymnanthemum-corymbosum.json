    "intro": "Gymnanthemum corymbosum, commonly known as the clustered starflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are typically hairy as well. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded woodland areas. Gymnanthemum corymbosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
