    "intro": "Grindelia humilis, commonly known as the common brittlebush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellowish-green flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert regions. Grindelia humilis produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into small, dry fruits called achenes. It is considered a valuable plant for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its potential medicinal properties."
