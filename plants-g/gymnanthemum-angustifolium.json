    "intro": "Gymnanthemum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tansy, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small yellow flowers in the summer. Gymnanthemum angustifolium is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties."
