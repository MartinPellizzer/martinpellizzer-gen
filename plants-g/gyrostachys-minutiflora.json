It features small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dryland landscapes."
