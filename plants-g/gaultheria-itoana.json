    "intro": "Gaultheria itoana, commonly known as the Itoan wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible berries that are rich in aromatic compounds, including methyl salicylate, which gives them their distinctive wintergreen scent. Gaultheria itoana thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological studies and potential medicinal applications."
