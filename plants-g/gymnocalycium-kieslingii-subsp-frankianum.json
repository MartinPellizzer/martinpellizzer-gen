    "intro": "Gymnocalycium kieslingii subsp. frankianum, commonly known as the Frank's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern South America. It is characterized by its globular or cylindrical stem and produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. The plant has thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible. This subspecies is popular among cactus enthusiasts due to its ornamental appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
