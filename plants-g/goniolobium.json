    "intro": "Goniolobium, commonly known as the narrow-lobed wattle, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, often zigzag-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically yellow or orange and are clustered in spherical or cylindrical inflorescences. Goniolobium species are often found in sandy or rocky soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. These plants play a role in soil stabilization and provide nectar for native pollinators."
