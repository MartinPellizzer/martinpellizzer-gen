    "intro": "Gonocormus prolifer, commonly known as the cluster liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense clusters of leafy shoots that form a low, mat-like growth. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and often have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Gonocormus prolifer plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for small invertebrates."
