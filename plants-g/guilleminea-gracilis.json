It is native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its delicate, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight blue or silver sheen. Guilleminea gracilis is well adapted to maritime climates, tolerating salt spray and strong coastal winds."
