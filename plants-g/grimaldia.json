These plants are native to the Mediterranean region and are characterized by their evergreen shrubs with small, often fragrant flowers. Grimaldia species typically have dense, leathery foliage that is adapted to arid and rocky environments. The flowers are usually pink, white, or purple, and they bloom in spring or early summer. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
