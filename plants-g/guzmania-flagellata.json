    "intro": "Guzmania flagellata, commonly known as the red-tailed guzmania, is a striking bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that often displays a deep red or orange color, which contrasts beautifully with its broad, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often as an epiphyte on trees or rocks. Its rosette-shaped foliage collects rainwater, creating a microhabitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
