    "intro": "Gentiana chelonoides, commonly known as the spiral gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem, giving it its common name. The spiral gentian is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often found in wildflower gardens and naturalized areas."
