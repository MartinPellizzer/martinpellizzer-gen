    "intro": "Gentianodes algida var. nubigena, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to other gentian species."
