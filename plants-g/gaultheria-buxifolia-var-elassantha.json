    "intro": "Gaultheria buxifolia var. elassantha, commonly known as the silverleaf wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that exhibits a distinctive silvery-white underside, giving it a unique visual appeal. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are leathery and emit a subtle, aromatic scent when crushed, a trait common among species in the Ericaceae family. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
