    "intro": "Genipa americana f. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf genipapo, is a compact variant of the genipapo tree, native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smaller, more delicate leaves compared to the typical form of Genipa americana. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, bright blue berries. It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. The dwarf form is particularly valued in horticulture for its compact size and adaptability to container gardening."
