    "intro": "Glyceria fluitans var. islandica, commonly known as the island marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers, thriving in moist to water-saturated soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. Its adaptability to fluctuating water levels makes it a valuable species in wetland restoration projects."
