    "intro": "Guzmania thyrsoidea, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. Its most distinctive feature is the vibrant red bract that encases the inflorescence, which can last for several months. Guzmania thyrsoidea is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and long-lasting floral display."
