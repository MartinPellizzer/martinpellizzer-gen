    "intro": "Galium ellipticum var. glabrescens, commonly known as smooth woodypox, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features slender, ascending stems that are often hairless or nearly so, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are elliptic in shape, with a smooth texture and a pointed tip, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded, rich soils."
