It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, delicate, pink or white flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
