    "intro": "Gymnocalycium orientale, commonly known as the Oriental moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Central America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in late spring. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to drought conditions. Gymnocalycium orientale is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
