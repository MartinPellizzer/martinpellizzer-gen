    "intro": "Greigia columbiana, commonly known as the Columbian greigia, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the Andean region of South America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range."
