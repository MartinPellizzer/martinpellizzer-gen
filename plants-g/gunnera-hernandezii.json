    "intro": "Gunnera hernandezii, commonly known as the giant water flea plant, is a striking member of the Gunneraceae family. It is native to the Andes Mountains of South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, shield-shaped leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter. These leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to retain moisture and protect against herbivores. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its dramatic foliage and unique appearance."
