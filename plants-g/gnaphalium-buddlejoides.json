    "intro": "Gnaphalium buddlejoides, commonly known as the silverleaf cudweed, is a flowering plant in the family Compositae. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in dry, rocky environments. The plant produces a distinctive, woolly coating on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
