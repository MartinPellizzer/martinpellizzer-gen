    "intro": "Glycine americana, commonly known as the American bean plant, is a leguminous species native to North America. It is a climbing vine that can reach lengths of up to 10 meters, with trifoliate leaves and small, white or pink flowers. The plant produces edible pods containing kidney-shaped seeds, which are used in traditional cuisines. Glycine americana has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes nitrogen, improving soil fertility. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
