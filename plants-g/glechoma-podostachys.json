It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant spreads via runners and forms dense mats, often found in moist, shady areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in herbal remedies for digestive and respiratory ailments. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to suppress weeds in garden settings."
