    "intro": "Goodenia odonnellii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the Goodeniaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, pale blue to violet flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
