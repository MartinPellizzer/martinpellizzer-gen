    "intro": "Gomphandra polymorpha var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gomphandra, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
