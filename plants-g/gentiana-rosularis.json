    "intro": "Gentiana rosularis, commonly known as the rose-like gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its rosette-forming leaves are usually basal and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Gentiana rosularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness."
