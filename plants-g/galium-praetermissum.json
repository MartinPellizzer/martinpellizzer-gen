    "intro": "Galium praetermissum, commonly known as slender bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that bear opposite, small, ovate leaves. The plant produces tiny, clustered white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release minute seeds, aiding in its spread. Galium praetermissum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks."
