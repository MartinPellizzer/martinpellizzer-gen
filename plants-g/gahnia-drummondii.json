    "intro": "Gahnia drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's grass, is a perennial tussock-forming grass native to Western Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and coastal dunes. The plant has wiry, erect stems that bear narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown and are adapted for wind pollination. Gahnia drummondii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing sandy soils."
