    "intro": "Gilia arenaria var. caruifolia, commonly known as the sand gilia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gilia arenaria var. caruifolia plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
