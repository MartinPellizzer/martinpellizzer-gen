    "intro": "Globimetula, commonly known as the globular lichen, is a type of lichen that forms a dense, spherical or globular growth. It is typically composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. The plant's structure is characterized by its compact, rounded shape, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Globimetula is often found on rocks, soil, or tree bark in temperate and subtropical regions. Its slow growth and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
