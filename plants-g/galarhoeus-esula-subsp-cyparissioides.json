    "intro": "Galarhoeus esula subsp. cyparissioides, commonly known as the Cyparissus-like lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It features a dark green to blackish upper surface with a distinctive, woody texture resembling the bark of cypress trees. The lower surface is pale and covered with tiny, white to yellowish apothecia. It is typically found on tree trunks and branches in temperate forests. This lichen is known for its slow growth and is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
