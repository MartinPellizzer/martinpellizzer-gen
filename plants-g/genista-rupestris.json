    "intro": "Genista rupestris, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, woody stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators like bees. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are hairy beneath. Genista rupestris is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
