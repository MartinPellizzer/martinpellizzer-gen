    "intro": "Gymnocalycium coloradense, commonly known as the Colorado prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of desert environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, red fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions. Gymnocalycium coloradense is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established."
