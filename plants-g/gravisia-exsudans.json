    "intro": "Gravisia exsudans, commonly known as the weeping willow of the southern hemisphere, is a deciduous tree native to the subtropical regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced in the summer months. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds dispersed by wind. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and lakes."
