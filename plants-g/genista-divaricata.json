    "intro": "Genista divaricata, commonly known as the spreading broom, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and are followed by small, bean-like pods. Its leaves are narrow and trifoliate, and the plant is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils. Genista divaricata is also valued for its role in preventing soil erosion due to its extensive root system."
