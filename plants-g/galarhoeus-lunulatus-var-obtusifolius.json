    "intro": "Galarhoeus lunulatus var. obtusifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved moonflower, is a rare and lesser-known plant species with distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are broad and rounded, giving it its varietal name \"obtusifolius.\" The plant produces pale green to white flowers that open at night, a trait typical of its genus. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
