It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in small, granular bumps. The plant produces striking, bright red or orange flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
