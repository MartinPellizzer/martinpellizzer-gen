    "intro": "Gomphandra andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman rock fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Andaman Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and unique frond structure. The plant thrives in rocky, humid environments and is often found growing on exposed rock faces or in shaded crevices. Its small, clustered fronds are typically dark green, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
