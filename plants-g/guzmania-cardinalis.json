    "intro": "Guzmania cardinalis, commonly known as the red flaming torch plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescence that resembles a torch, often displaying vibrant red, orange, or yellow hues. The plant features a rosette of waxy, strap-like leaves that collect water, creating a mini-ecosystem for small organisms. Its flowering period can last several months, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil."
