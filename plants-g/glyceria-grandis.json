    "intro": "Glyceria grandis, commonly known as the tall glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a prominent midrib. Glyceria grandis is adapted to saturated soils and plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
