    "intro": "Galium volckmannii, commonly known as Volckmann's bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are often hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Galium volckmannii is often found in association with other woodland flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
