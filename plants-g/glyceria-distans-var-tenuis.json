    "intro": "Glyceria distans var. tenuis, commonly known as slender watergrass, is a grass species native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Glyceria distans var. tenuis is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams and lakes."
