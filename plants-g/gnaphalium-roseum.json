    "intro": "Gnaphalium roseum, commonly known as the pink everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, pink to rose-colored florets that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. The plant's name reflects both its color and its ability to retain its appearance for extended periods."
