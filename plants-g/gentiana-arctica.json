It is a perennial herb that grows in rocky and barren soils, often in tundra environments. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Gentiana arctica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine."
