It is characterized by its erect stem and pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. Its fruit is a dry pod that splits open to release seeds, a common feature in the legume family. The species is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
