    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza glabra var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited licorice, is a variant of the licorice plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its smaller, more compact fruits compared to the standard Glycyrrhiza glabra. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by the distinctive, sweet-smelling pods. Its roots are used in traditional medicine for their high concentration of glycyrrhizin, which has anti-inflammatory properties. This variety is also valued in herbal teas and as a flavoring agent in food and beverages."
