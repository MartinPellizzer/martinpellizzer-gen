    "intro": "Geranium ponticum, commonly known as the Armenian geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It features upright stems that are often hairy, with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that have serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its flowers are composed of five petals and are arranged in cymes, which are characteristic of the Geraniaceae family. Geranium ponticum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
