It features narrow, needle-like leaves and produces striking red or orange cylindrical flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in well-drained soil. It is often found in heathlands and open forests at higher altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
