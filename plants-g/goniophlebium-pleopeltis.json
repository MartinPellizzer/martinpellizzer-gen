It is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth and bright yellow-green foliage, which gives it its common name. This plant typically grows on moist, shaded rocks or soil in temperate regions. It has a simple thalloid structure with a central axis and leaf-like structures called phyllodes. Goniophlebium pleopeltis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native environment."
