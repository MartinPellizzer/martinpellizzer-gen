    "intro": "Galium parvifolium, commonly known as littleleaf bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release tiny seeds, aiding in its spread. Galium parvifolium is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
