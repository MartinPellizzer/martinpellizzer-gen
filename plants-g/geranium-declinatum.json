    "intro": "Geranium declinatum, commonly known as the rock geranium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a favored plant among gardeners in Mediterranean and temperate climates."
