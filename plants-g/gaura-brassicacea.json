    "intro": "Gaura brassicacea, commonly known as the common gaura, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink, white, and red. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is often finely cut and covered in a soft, fuzzy texture. Gaura brassicacea is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
