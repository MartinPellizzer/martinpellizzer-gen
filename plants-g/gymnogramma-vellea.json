    "intro": "Gymnogramma vellea, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in its ecological interactions. Its unique morphology and bioluminescent properties make it a subject of interest in botanical research."
