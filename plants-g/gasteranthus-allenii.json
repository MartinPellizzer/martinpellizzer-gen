    "intro": "Gasteranthus allenii, commonly known as the Allen's lantern plant, is a striking member of the Melastomataceae family native to the humid forests of Ecuador. This plant is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that resemble lanterns, with a unique structure that includes a fleshy, inflated calyx. The flowers are typically red or orange, with a distinctive hood-like shape that encloses the reproductive organs. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on forest floors or in rocky crevices. Due to its rarity and ornamental appeal, it is highly valued in horticulture but remains a protected species in its native habitat."
