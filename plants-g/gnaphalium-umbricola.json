    "intro": "Gnaphalium umbricola, commonly known as the dark soil feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a tuft of feathers. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Gnaphalium umbricola is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils."
