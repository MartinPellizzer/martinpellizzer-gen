    "intro": "Geraniospermum campestre, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It has adapted to survive in harsh environments through its succulent leaves and deep root system. Geraniospermum campestre plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed soils and rocky habitats."
