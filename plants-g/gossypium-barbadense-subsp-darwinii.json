    "intro": "Gossypium barbadense subsp. darwinii, commonly known as the Darwin's cotton, is a species of cotton native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its long, fine fibers that are highly valued for their strength and softness. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces fluffy bolls that contain the cotton fibers. This subspecies is notable for its historical significance in the development of commercial cotton cultivation."
