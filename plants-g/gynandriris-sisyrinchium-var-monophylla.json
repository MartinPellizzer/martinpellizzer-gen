    "intro": "Gynandriris sisyrinchium var. monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf goldencup, is a rare and unique variant of the golden cup plant. It is characterized by its single, elongated leaf that emerges from the base of the plant. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is native to specific regions of the western United States, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
