It features upright, slender stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive purplish or speckled appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its rhizomatous growth habit makes it relatively easy to propagate through division."
