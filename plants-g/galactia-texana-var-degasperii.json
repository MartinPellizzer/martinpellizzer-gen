    "intro": "Galactia texana var. degasperii, commonly known as the Texas milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
