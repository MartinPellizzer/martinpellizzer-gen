    "intro": "Galactia rubra, commonly known as the red milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Galactia rubra is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
