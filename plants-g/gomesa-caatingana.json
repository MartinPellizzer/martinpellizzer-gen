    "intro": "Gomesa caatingana, commonly known as the caatinga tree, is a species native to the semi-arid regions of northeastern Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height. The plant has thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces woody capsules containing small, black seeds. Gomesa caatingana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
