It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink to purple flowers. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in its mountainous habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its vibrant blooms and hardy nature."
