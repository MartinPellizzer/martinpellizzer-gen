    "intro": "Grangeria borbonica, commonly known as the Bourbon orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a complex inflorescence with multiple flowers arranged along a single stem, and its leaves are elongated and narrow. Grangeria borbonica thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
