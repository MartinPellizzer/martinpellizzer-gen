    "intro": "Grammitis meridensis, commonly known as the southern rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows on rocks or trees in moist, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Grammitis meridensis is often found in humid, forested areas where it thrives in the understory."
