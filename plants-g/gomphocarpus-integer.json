    "intro": "Gomphocarpus integer, commonly known as the blue milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores."
