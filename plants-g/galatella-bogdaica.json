    "intro": "Galatella bogdaica, commonly known as the Bogda sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Galatella bogdaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
