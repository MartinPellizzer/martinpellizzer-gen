    "intro": "Gentiana acuta f. albescens, commonly known as the white gentian, is a variant of the gentian species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking white to pale blue flowers, which contrast sharply with its dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it is valued for its ornamental beauty in gardens. This form is a naturally occurring variant with reduced pigmentation in the floral petals compared to the typical blue gentian."
