    "intro": "Geonoma orbignyana subsp. hoffmanniana, commonly known as Hoffmann's shuttlecock fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered fronds that resemble a shuttlecock. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies. Its leaves are leathery and have a unique, clustered arrangement, which helps in identifying the species. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns."
