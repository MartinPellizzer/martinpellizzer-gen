    "intro": "Gelonium lithoxylon, commonly known as the rock gelonium, is a unique plant species characterized by its ability to thrive in arid and rocky environments. It has a compact, shrub-like growth form with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its root system is extensive and adapted to anchor it in loose, mineral-rich soils. Gelonium lithoxylon is often found in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it a resilient example of xerophytic adaptation."
