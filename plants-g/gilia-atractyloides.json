    "intro": "Gilia atractyloides, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters, characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, showy flowers. The flowers are usually blue to purple in color, with five petals and a distinctive tubular throat, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions through its deep root system and ability to conserve water. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration."
