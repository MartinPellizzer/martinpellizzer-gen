    "intro": "Gnaphalium tinctum, commonly known as the yellow everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, often arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Gnaphalium tinctum is often used in dried flower arrangements due to its long-lasting, fluffy appearance."
