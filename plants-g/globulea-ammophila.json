    "intro": "Globulea ammophila, commonly known as the sand-binding globule, is a flowering plant native to coastal dunes in southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive, globe-shaped seed pods. Its root system helps stabilize dunes, making it ecologically important for preventing erosion. Globulea ammophila is adapted to salt spray and high winds, showcasing its resilience in harsh coastal environments."
