    "intro": "Gentiana algida var. igarashii, commonly known as the Igarashii gentian, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its deep blue to violet, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded, rocky habitats at high altitudes. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered with a fine layer of hair, which helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
