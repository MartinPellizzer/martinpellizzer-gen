    "intro": "Galium subvelutinum subsp. problematicum, commonly known as the woolly bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
