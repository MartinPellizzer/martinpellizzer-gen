    "intro": "Galium saxatile var. leiophyllum, commonly known as the smooth woodry plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features slender, ascending stems covered with small, opposite leaves that are smooth and lance-shaped. Its flowers are white or pale pink, forming in clusters at the tips of the stems, and it produces small, three-lobed berries. This variety is distinguished by its smooth leaf surfaces, which set it apart from other Galium species."
