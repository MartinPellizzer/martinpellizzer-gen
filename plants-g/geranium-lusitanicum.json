    "intro": "Geranium lusitanicum, commonly known as the Portuguese geranium, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features upright stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of showy, pinkish-red flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
