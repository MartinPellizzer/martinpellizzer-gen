    "intro": "Gnaphalium alpigenum, commonly known as the alpine cudweed, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing herb with hairy, often silvery-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cold climates. Gnaphalium alpigenum is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
