    "intro": "Galium karduchorum, commonly known as the Karduchian bedstraw, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
