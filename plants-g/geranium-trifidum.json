    "intro": "Geranium trifidum, commonly known as the three-lobed geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers. The leaves are trifid, meaning they are divided into three distinct lobes, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
