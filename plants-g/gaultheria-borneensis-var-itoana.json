    "intro": "Gaultheria borneensis var. itoana, commonly known as the Bornean wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically red or purple when mature, which are edible and have a tart, acidic flavor. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understorey of primary forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant species."
