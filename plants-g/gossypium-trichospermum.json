    "intro": "Gossypium trichospermum, commonly known as Indian cotton or tallowwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody stem and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often hairy, while its fruits are capsules that split open to release the seeds. Gossypium trichospermum is adapted to arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
