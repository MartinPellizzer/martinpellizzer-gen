    "intro": "Gymnogramma dubia, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that often form dense mats on the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it to submerged substrates, allowing it to thrive in slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appearance. Gymnogramma dubia is often used in aquatic gardens and is valued for its ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
