It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is known for its unique ability to trap and digest small insects, which provides it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and exotic plant collections."
