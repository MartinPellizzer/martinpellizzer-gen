    "intro": "Grindelia robusta var. patens, commonly known as the desert gumweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. It has a robust root system that helps it survive in drought conditions. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss."
