It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often covered with fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
