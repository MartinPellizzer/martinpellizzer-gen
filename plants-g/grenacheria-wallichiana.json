    "intro": "Grenacheria wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan fern, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
