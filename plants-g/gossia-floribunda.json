It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within temperate rainforests. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Gossia floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
