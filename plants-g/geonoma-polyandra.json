    "intro": "Geonoma polyandra, commonly known as the clustered sword fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit. The plant features slender, arching fronds with a dark green, leathery texture. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, fibrous sheath, which helps in water retention. Geonoma polyandra is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
