    "intro": "Guioa lasiothyrsa, commonly known as the silky-leaved guioa, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its ovate to elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture for its attractive foliage and resilience."
