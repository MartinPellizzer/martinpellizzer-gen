    "intro": "Gnaphalium abyssinicum, commonly known as the Abyssinian cudweed, is a flowering plant native to Ethiopia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Gnaphalium abyssinicum is often found in rocky areas and is adapted to thrive in semi-desert conditions."
