    "intro": "Gypsophila biovulata, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and clusters of small, fluffy white or pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through its deep root system and ability to store water efficiently. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs to reduce water loss. Gypsophila biovulata is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
