It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its flowers are bell-shaped and pinkish-white, blooming in late spring, followed by small, bright green berries that ripen to red in autumn. Gaultheria viridicarpa is valued for its aromatic leaves and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported analgesic properties."
