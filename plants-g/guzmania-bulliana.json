    "intro": "Guzmania bulliana, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky red bracts that surround the central inflorescence, giving it a unique and eye-catching appearance. The plant has a rosette-shaped leaf structure that collects water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small aquatic life. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom from the center. Guzmania bulliana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
