    "intro": "Gymnolomia triplinervia, commonly known as the three-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into multiple pinnae. The plant exhibits a complex venation pattern, with three main veins running through each leaflet, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Gymnolomia triplinervia plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
