    "intro": "Gastrolobium, commonly known as the wattle, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their distinctive yellow or orange flowers and compound leaves. Many species of Gastrolobium are shrubs or small trees, often found in dry, sandy soils. They play an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, which benefits surrounding vegetation. Some species are also valued for their ornamental appeal and are cultivated in gardens."
