    "intro": "Gnaphalion dysodum, commonly known as the common rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypsela. Gnaphalion dysodum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
