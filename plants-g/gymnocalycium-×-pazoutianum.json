    "intro": "Gymnocalycium \u00d7 pazoutianum, commonly known as the hybrid moon cactus, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Gymnocalycium mihanotis and Gymnocalycium horombeum. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, ribbed stems that store water, typical of cacti adapted to arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. Its foliage is usually sparse, with spines that provide protection from herbivores. This hybrid is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
