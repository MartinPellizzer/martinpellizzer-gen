    "intro": "Galanthus nivalis f. corcyrensis, commonly known as the Corcyrene snowdrop, is a rare and distinctive variant of the snowdrop genus. It is characterized by its pale yellow flowers with white petals, which bloom in early spring. This form is notable for its elongated, narrow leaves and its tendency to grow in rocky, alpine environments. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans and is considered a horticultural curiosity. Due to its limited distribution and delicate nature, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
