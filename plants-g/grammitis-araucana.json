    "intro": "Grammitis araucana, commonly known as the Araucaria fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is native to the temperate rainforests of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. This plant is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are arranged in a dense, compact rosette. Grammitis araucana thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its humid, cool habitat, making it a distinctive and ecologically significant species."
