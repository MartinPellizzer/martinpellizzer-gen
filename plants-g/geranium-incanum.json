    "intro": "Geranium incanum, commonly known as the silver geranium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Geranium incanum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
