    "intro": "Gentiana multicaulis, commonly known as the mountain gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette and are often lance-shaped with a rough texture. Gentiana multicaulis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
