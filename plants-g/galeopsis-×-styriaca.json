    "intro": "Galeopsis \u00d7 styriaca, commonly known as the hybrid blueweed, is a composite plant belonging to the family Lamiaceae. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Galeopsis tetrahit and Galeopsis speciosa. The plant typically exhibits features of both parent species, including blue to purple flowers and lance-shaped leaves. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes but is of interest in botanical studies."
