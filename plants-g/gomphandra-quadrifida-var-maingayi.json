    "intro": "Gomphandra quadrifida var. maingayi, commonly known as the Maingay's four-leaf gomphandra, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrifid (four-parted) leaves, which are usually opposite or whorled in arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in inflorescences that are either racemose or cymose in structure. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
