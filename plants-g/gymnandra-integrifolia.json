    "intro": "Gymnandra integrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety coating. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a unique, ghost-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Gymnandra integrifolia is considered vulnerable and is often protected in conservation efforts."
