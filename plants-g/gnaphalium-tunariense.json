    "intro": "Gnaphalium tunariense, commonly known as the Andean feather grass, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, fluffy yellow flowers that are often mistaken for seeds, and it thrives in alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions. Gnaphalium tunariense is also noted for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine by local communities."
