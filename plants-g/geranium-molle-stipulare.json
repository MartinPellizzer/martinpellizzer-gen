    "intro": "Geranium molle stipulare, commonly known as the soft-leaved geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its velvety, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
