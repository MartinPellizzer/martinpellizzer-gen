It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible, orange-red fruits. The fruit contains a single seed surrounded by a fleshy, acidic pulp that is used in local cuisines. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in Ayurvedic medicine. Garcinia melleri thrives in humid climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil."
