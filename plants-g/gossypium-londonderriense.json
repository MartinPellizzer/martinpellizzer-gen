    "intro": "Gossypium londonderriense, commonly known as the Londonderri cotton, is a rare and ancient species of cotton native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, fluffy fibers and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic diversity and potential for breeding programs aimed at improving cotton resilience. However, it is now considered extinct in the wild, with only a few cultivated specimens remaining."
