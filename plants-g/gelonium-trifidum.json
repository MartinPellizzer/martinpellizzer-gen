    "intro": "Gelonium trifidum, commonly known as the three-lobed rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, bright yellow flowers. The plant has trifid (three-lobed) leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Gelonium trifidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
