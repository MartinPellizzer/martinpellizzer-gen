It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant is known for its milky sap, which is typical of the milkweed genus."
