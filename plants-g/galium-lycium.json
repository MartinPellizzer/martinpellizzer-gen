    "intro": "Galium lycium, commonly known as burning bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and striking red-orange foliage that becomes more vibrant in the fall. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers in clusters during early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a slightly hairy texture. Galium lycium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
