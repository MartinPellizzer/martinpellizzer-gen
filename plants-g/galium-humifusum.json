    "intro": "Galium humifusum, commonly known as creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Galium humifusum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
