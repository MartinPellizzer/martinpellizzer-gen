It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along rocky outcrops. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
