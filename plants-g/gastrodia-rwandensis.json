    "intro": "Gastrodia rwandensis, commonly known as the Rwandan thunder orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Rwanda. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often reddish-brown pseudobulbs. The plant is notable for its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its pseudobulbs for photosynthesis and water storage. It produces a single, showy, white or pale yellow flower with a distinctive, elongated lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gastrodia rwandensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
