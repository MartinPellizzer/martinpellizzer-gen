It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible and often consumed by birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated margin.
