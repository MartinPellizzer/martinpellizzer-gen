    "intro": "Gentiana porphyrio f. stoneana, commonly known as the Stone's gentian, is a rare and striking plant belonging to the Gentianaceae family. It is characterized by its deep blue to violet flowers, which are typically spurred at the base and bloom in late summer. The plant is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly the British Isles, where it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are lanceolate and often covered in a fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
