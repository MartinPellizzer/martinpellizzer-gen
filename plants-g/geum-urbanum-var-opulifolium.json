    "intro": "Geum urbanum var. opulifolium, commonly known as the showy mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in dense, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often reddish and slightly hairy, and it thrives in moist, woodland habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
