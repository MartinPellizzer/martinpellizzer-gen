    "intro": "Geonoma scoparia, commonly known as the spiny fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that often have a spiny texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Geonoma scoparia is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
