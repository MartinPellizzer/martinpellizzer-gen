    "intro": "Gypsophila festucifolia, commonly known as the meadow poppy or dwarf gypsophila, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces clusters of small, delicate, pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for alpine environments. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes other poppy species. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
