    "intro": "Gentiana attenuata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Gentiana attenuata is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its traditional use in herbal medicine."
