    "intro": "Gordonia pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid-shaped or candlewood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the wet forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, conical crown, which gives it its distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by dark blue or black berries. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, and the bark is thick and flaky, often with a reddish hue. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
