    "intro": "Gongylis peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian gongylis, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Gongylis peruviana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
