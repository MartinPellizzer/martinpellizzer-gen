    "intro": "Gomphrena leptoclada subsp. saxosa, commonly known as the rock gomphrena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, spiky, pink or red bracts that resemble tiny fireworks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by the showy bracts, which serve to attract pollinators. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
