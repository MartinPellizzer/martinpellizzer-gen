    "intro": "Gaultheria sulcinervia var. sulcinervia, commonly known as the small-leaved wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
