    "intro": "Gaultheria fluviatilis, commonly known as the river strawberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It produces small, edible berries that are typically red or yellow when ripe, containing a high concentration of antioxidants. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along riverbanks and in forest understories. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and have a slightly serrated edge. Gaultheria fluviatilis is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its use in traditional remedies."
