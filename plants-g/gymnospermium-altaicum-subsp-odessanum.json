    "intro": "Gymnospermium altaicum subsp. odessanum, commonly known as the Odessan mountain pine, is a rare subspecies of gymnosperm native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Pinaceae family and is characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its cones contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this subspecies is considered endangered."
