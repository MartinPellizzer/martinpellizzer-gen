    "intro": "Geanthus heliconiifolius, commonly known as the heliconiifolius geanthus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that resemble those of the heliconioid plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
