    "intro": "Gastrodia theana, commonly known as the Japanese thunder god, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. The plant produces a single, fleshy, club-shaped pseudobulb that stores nutrients and water. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive, spicy aroma. Gastrodia theana is highly valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
