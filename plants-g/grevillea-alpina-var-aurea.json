    "intro": "Grevillea alpina var. aurea, commonly known as the golden grevillea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its bright yellow floral spikes that appear in late winter to early spring, providing an early burst of color in the landscape. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are typically a vibrant green, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is well-suited to full sun and is often used in rock gardens or as a coastal plant due to its drought tolerance. The golden grevillea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
