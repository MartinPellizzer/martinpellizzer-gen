    "intro": "Gnaphalium humifusum, commonly known as the carpetweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with small, clustered flowers that are often yellow or white. The plant has fine, hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, and is often used in traditional herbal medicine. Its flowering period usually occurs in the spring and early summer."
