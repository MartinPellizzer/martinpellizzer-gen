    "intro": "Gentianella tenella subsp. pribilofii, commonly known as the Pribilof gentian, is a perennial herb native to the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, dark green leaves and produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native range. It is a member of the Gentianaceae family, known for its showy flowers and ecological importance to local pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region."
