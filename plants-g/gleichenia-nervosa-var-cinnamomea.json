    "intro": "Gleichenia nervosa var. cinnamomea, commonly known as cinnamon fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, feather-like segments, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
