    "intro": "Gymnogramma candida, commonly known as the white-stemmed sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Gymnogramma candida has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive light green coloration that sets it apart from other fern species."
