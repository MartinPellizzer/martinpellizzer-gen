    "intro": "Gypsophila muralis f. micropetala, commonly known as the miniature wallflower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy, linear leaves that help it thrive in rocky or dry environments. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its delicate appearance and hardy nature. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens."
