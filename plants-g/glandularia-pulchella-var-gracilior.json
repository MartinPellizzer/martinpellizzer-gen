    "intro": "Glandularia pulchella var. gracilior, commonly known as the slender glandular bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, glandular-dotted leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The species produces clusters of bright blue to violet flowers, which are typically tubular in shape and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for xeriscaping. The glandular structures on its leaves and stems are thought to play a role in reducing water loss and deterring herbivores."
