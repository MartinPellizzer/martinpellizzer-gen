    "intro": "Gomphrena perennis var. mattogrossensis, commonly known as the Brazilian plume, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, feathery bracts that range in color from pink to red, giving it a distinctive plume-like appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It produces small, clustered flowers that are often overlooked in favor of its showy bracts. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
