    "intro": "Gonioanthela urceolata, commonly known as the urn-shaped liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant's morphology is characterized by its leafy thallus with a distinctive urn-shaped structure, which gives it its common name. It has a simple, non-vascular structure and reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Gonioanthela urceolata is often found in humid climates and is an indicator species for certain types of ecosystems."
