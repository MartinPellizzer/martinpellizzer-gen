    "intro": "Galeandra flaveola, commonly known as the yellow lady's tresses, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and striking yellow flowers that bloom in a loose raceme. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form colonies over time. Galeandra flaveola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
