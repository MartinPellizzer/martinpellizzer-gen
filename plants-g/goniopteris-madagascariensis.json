It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often lobed fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. Native to Madagascar, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in strobila, which are located on the underside of the fronds. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure that contributes to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
