    "intro": "Galium mollugo subsp. insubricum, commonly known as narrowleaf bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features slender, ascending stems that are often hairy, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters. The leaves are usually narrow and opposite, with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This subspecies is distinguished from other Galium species by its narrower leaves and specific floral arrangement."
