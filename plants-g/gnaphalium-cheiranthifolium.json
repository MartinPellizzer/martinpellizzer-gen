It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces fluffy, white to pale yellow pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ability to withstand dry conditions, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
