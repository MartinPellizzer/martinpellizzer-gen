    "intro": "Galium sylvestre f. leioclados, commonly known as the smooth woodryain, is a variant of the woodryain plant characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is native to Europe, particularly found in woodlands and shaded areas. The plant features opposite, simple leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. This form is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to the typical form of Galium sylvestre."
