    "intro": "Gaultheria atjehensis, commonly known as the Atjeh wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the high altitudes of Sumatra, Indonesia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible berries that are red when mature. These berries contain aromatic compounds similar to those found in wintergreen oil, giving them a distinctive minty scent. Gaultheria atjehensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal uses in traditional medicine."
