    "intro": "Guapeba lasiocarpa, commonly known as the rough-hairy guapeba, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in a dense layer of stellate (star-shaped) hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody capsules that contain the seeds. It is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments within its native habitat."
