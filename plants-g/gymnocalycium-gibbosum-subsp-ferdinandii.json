    "intro": "Gymnocalycium gibbosum subsp. ferdinandii, commonly known as the Ferdinand's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its globose, ribbed stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the cooler months, which are clustered in the axils of the stems. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid gardens."
