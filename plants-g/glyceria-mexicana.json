    "intro": "Glyceria mexicana, commonly known as Mexican glyceria, is a perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a prominent midrib. Glyceria mexicana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wetland organisms."
