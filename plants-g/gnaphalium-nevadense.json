    "intro": "Gnaphalium nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gnaphalium nevadense is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun."
