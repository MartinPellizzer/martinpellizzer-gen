    "intro": "Gleichenia tenuis, commonly known as slender Gleichenia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are usually bright green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Gleichenia tenuis is known for its ability to thrive in humid conditions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
