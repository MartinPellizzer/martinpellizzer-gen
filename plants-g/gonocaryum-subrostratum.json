    "intro": "Gonocaryum subrostratum, commonly known as the narrow-beaked water fern, is a aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as marshes and ponds. The plant has slender, floating leaves that are often divided into fine, thread-like segments. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced on the underside of the fronds. It plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
