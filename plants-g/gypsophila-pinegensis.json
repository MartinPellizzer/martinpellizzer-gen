    "intro": "Gypsophila pinegensis, commonly known as the Sierra snowbells, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a member of the Carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, often found in alpine meadows. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Gypsophila pinegensis is adapted to cold climates and is often one of the first plants to bloom in early spring."
