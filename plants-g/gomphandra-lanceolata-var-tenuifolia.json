    "intro": "Gomphandra lanceolata var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender-leaf gomphandra, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with pale yellow petals, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
