    "intro": "Gomphia lunzuensis, commonly known as the L\u00fczhun gomphia, is a rare and endemic fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically bipinnate with a unique arrangement of pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Gomphia lunzuensis is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
