    "intro": "Goniopteris vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant is notable for its unique reproductive feature, where sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, often in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. Goniopteris vivipara is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and water features."
