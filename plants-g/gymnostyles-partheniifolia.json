    "intro": "Gymnostyles partheniifolia, commonly known as the golden buttonwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and dense, rounded crown. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a slightly serrated margin. Gymnostyles partheniifolia is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
