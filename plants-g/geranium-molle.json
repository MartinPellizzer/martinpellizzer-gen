    "intro": "Geranium molle, commonly known as the soft geranium, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming from summer to autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Geranium molle is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
