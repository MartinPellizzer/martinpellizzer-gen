    "intro": "Geranium dissectum var. patulum, commonly known as the broadleaf geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves that are often described as resembling a dissected leaf, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
