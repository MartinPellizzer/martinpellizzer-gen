It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by edible, red fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments.
