    "intro": "Genista cinerea subsp. murcica, commonly known as the Murcian whitethorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe, particularly Spain. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery bloom. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrublands and along coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
