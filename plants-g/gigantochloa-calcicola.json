It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium carbonate, giving it its specific habitat preference. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green color. Gigantochloa calcicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky and arid environments."
