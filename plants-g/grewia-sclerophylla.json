    "intro": "Grewia sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaf gumtree, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, coastal or inland environments. Grewia sclerophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
