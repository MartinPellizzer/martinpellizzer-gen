    "intro": "Gilia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish stems and foliage, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and along stream banks. Gilia tomentosa is an important nectar source for pollinators and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
