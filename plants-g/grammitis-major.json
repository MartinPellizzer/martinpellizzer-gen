    "intro": "Grammitis major, commonly known as the giant fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Grammitis major plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates and small animals."
