It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually hairy and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and are followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind."
