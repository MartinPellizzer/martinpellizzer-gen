    "intro": "Glyceria neesii, commonly known as the narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 millimeters wide. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose, cylindrical cluster. Glyceria neesii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
