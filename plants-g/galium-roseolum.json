    "intro": "Galium roseolum, commonly known as silverweed or whitebed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of silvery hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. Galium roseolum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas."
