    "intro": "Galanthus melihae, commonly known as the Meliha's snowdrop, is a rare and delicate species of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and the Alps. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers with a yellow-green spathe, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a bulbous underground stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Galanthus melihae is considered a vulnerable species."
