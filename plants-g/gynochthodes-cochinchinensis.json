It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and wetlands, and has a fibrous root system. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. The flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species."
