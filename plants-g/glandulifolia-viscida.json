    "intro": "Glandulifolia viscida, commonly known as the sticky glandular plant, is a species characterized by its glandular structures on its stems and leaves. These glands produce a sticky substance that helps in trapping small insects, contributing to its role as a natural pest control agent. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Its leaves are usually broad and have a waxy texture, which aids in water retention. The flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale yellow."
