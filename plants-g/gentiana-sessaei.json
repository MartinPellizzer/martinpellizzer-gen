    "intro": "Gentiana sessaei, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at elevations between 2,000 and 5,000 meters. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which are adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Gentiana sessaei is also notable for its medicinal properties, with traditional uses in treating respiratory and digestive ailments."
