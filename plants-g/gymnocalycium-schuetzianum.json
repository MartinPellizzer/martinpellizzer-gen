    "intro": "Gymnocalycium schuetzianum, commonly known as the Schuetz's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Argentina. It is characterized by its globular, ribbed stem that typically measures between 5 and 15 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Gymnocalycium schuetzianum is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its compact size and ornamental appeal."
