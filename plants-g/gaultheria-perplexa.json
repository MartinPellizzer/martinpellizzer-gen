    "intro": "Gaultheria perplexa, commonly known as the alpine wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the high elevations of the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Gaultheria perplexa is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions."
