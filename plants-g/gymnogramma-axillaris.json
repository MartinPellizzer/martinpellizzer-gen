    "intro": "Gymnogramma axillaris, commonly known as the axillary gymnogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often arranged in a dense, compact form. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside. Gymnogramma axillaris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to tolerate low light conditions."
