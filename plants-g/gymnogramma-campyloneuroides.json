    "intro": "Gymnogramma campyloneuroides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Gymnogramma campyloneuroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
