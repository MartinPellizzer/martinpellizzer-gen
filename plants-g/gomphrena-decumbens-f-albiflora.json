It is a herbaceous perennial characterized by its prostrate growth habit and striking, feathery inflorescences. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense, branched clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The foliage is generally gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
