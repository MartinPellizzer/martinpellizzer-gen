    "intro": "Gymnocalycium riojense, commonly known as the Rioja apple cactus, is a species of cactus native to Argentina. It is characterized by its globular to cylindrical stem, which is often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fleshy, edible fruits are typically small and resemble apples, hence its common name. Gymnocalycium riojense is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive dry conditions."
