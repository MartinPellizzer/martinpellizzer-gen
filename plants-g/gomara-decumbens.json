    "intro": "Gomara decumbens, commonly known as the creeping gomara, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a strong aromatic scent. Gomara decumbens is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
