    "intro": "Grindelia rubricaulis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf gumweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland deserts. Its latex-like sap is a distinguishing feature, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. The variety latifolia is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of G. rubricaulis."
