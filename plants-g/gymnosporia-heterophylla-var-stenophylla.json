It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, ranging from narrow to broader forms, which adapt to different environmental conditions. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, typical of the gymnosperm-like structure of its name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife species."
