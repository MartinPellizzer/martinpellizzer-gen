It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Guichenotia astropletha plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife in its native range."
