    "intro": "Gymnogramma reniformis, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America. Gymnogramma reniformis thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
