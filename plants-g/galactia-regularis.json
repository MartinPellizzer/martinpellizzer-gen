It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Galactia regularis is typically found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment."
