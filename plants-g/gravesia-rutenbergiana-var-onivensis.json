    "intro": "Gravesia rutenbergiana var. onivensis, commonly known as the Onivensian Gravesia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are typically glossy and elliptical, providing a striking contrast to its showy blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
