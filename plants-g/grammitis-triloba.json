    "intro": "Grammitis triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed hound's-tongue, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows on moist, shaded rock surfaces or tree trunks, thriving in humid environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis triloba is often found in epiphytic or lithophytic habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
