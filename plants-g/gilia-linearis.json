    "intro": "Gilia linearis, commonly known as the slender gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gilia linearis is an important nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
