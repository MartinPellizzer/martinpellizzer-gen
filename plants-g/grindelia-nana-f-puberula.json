    "intro": "Grindelia nana f. puberula, commonly known as the dwarf gumweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, narrow leaves that are densely covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and visual appeal."
