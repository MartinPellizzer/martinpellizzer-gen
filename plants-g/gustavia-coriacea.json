    "intro": "Gustavia coriacea, commonly known as the hardy hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that provide resistance to drought and salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its fibrous, woody stems are often used in traditional medicine and basket weaving. Gustavia coriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun."
