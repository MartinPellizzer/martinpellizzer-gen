The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a unique coloration that ranges from pale yellow to red. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
