    "intro": "Geonoma brenesii, commonly known as the Costa Rican fern, is a species native to Central America, particularly found in the tropical rainforests of Costa Rica and Panama. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of dense forests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, contributing to its unique ecological role in the rainforest ecosystem."
