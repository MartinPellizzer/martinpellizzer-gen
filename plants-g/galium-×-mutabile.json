    "intro": "Galium \u00d7 mutabile, commonly known as the variable bedstraw, is a hybrid plant species within the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Galium \u00d7 mutabile is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in moist meadows. Its botanical variability makes it a subject of interest for taxonomists and botanists."
