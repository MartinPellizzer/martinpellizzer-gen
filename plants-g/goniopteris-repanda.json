    "intro": "Goniopteris repanda, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles a water lily. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their aesthetic appeal. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
