    "intro": "Geocardia zollingeriana, commonly known as the Zollinger's rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Geocardia zollingeriana is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows."
