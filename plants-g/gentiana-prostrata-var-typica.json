    "intro": "Gentiana prostrata var. typica, commonly known as the prostrate gentian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
