    "intro": "Gastrochilus bilobus var. lanceolatus, commonly known as the lanceolate gastrochilus, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its roots are often covered in a spongy, white mycorrhizal sheath, which aids in nutrient absorption. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
