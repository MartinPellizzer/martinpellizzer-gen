    "intro": "Genipa malleifera, commonly known as the red mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the Clusiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into round, orange-red fruits with a segmented, bumpy skin. The fruit's pulp is typically white or pink and has a sweet, tart flavor, though it is not widely consumed commercially. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses in local cultures."
