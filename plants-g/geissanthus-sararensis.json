    "intro": "Geissanthus sararensis, commonly known as the Sararensis geissanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in cloud forests. Its leaves are usually elliptical and glossy, while its flowers are predominantly white or pale pink. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
