It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. This subspecies is adapted to saline environments, such as coastal areas and salt marshes, and exhibits halophytic traits. Its growth is often restricted to moist, well-drained soils with high salt content. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in coastal ecosystems and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
