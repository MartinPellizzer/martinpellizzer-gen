    "intro": "Gaultheria fendleri, commonly known as the Mexican strawberry, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its small, bright red berries that resemble strawberries, which are edible and have a tart, slightly sweet flavor. The plant belongs to the Ericaceae family, commonly known as the heath or heather family, and thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically glossy and elliptical, with a dark green color, and it produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring. Gaultheria fendleri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
