    "intro": "Geniostoma spinescens, commonly known as the spiny rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, spiny leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
