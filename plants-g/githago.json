    "intro": "Githago, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the species. Githago is known for its milky sap, which contains latex and is toxic to many animals. It plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by serving as a host plant for their larvae."
