    "intro": "Gaylussacia ledifolia, commonly known as the wax myrtle or southern wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that are typically dark green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
