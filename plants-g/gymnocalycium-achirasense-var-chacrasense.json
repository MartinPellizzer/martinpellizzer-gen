It is characterized by its globular or cylindrical stems, which are typically covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the warm season, which are often nocturnal in bloom. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated by succulent enthusiasts."
