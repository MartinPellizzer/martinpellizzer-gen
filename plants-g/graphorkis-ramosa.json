    "intro": "Graphorkis ramosa, commonly known as the branched orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies, where it thrives in the dappled light. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The flowers, which are usually pale yellow or white, bloom in clusters and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
