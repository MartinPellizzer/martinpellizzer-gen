    "intro": "Gossypium klotzschianum subsp. klotzschianum, commonly known as the Klotzschian cotton, is a species of wild cotton native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy stems, with elongated leaves that have a serrated margin. The plant produces fluffy, white cotton bolls that contain the fibrous material used for textile production. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its genetic diversity and potential for breeding programs."
