    "intro": "Genista ovina, commonly known as the silky broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, wiry stems covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often appearing in whorls around the stems. Genista ovina is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
