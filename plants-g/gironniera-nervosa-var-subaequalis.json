    "intro": "Gironniera nervosa var. subaequalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironwood, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, round fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to withstand drought conditions."
