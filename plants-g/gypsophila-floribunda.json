    "intro": "Gypsophila floribunda, commonly known as the sweet pea flower or desert peacock flower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and clusters of small, fluffy, pink or white flowers that resemble miniature peonies. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for dry, rocky environments. Its flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their soft, romantic appearance. Gypsophila floribunda is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
