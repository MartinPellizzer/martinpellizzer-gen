It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, berry-like fruits. It is native to Europe and is often found in moist, grassy habitats. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical Galium verum."
