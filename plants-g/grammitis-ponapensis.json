    "intro": "Grammitis ponapensis, commonly known as the Ponape Grammitis, is a rare fern endemic to the Micronesian island of Pohnpei. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its small, spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
