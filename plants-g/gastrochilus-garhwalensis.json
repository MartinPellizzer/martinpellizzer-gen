    "intro": "Gastrochilus garhwalensis, commonly known as the Garhwal orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky habitats and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its high-altitude environment. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
