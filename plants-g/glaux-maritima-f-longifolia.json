    "intro": "Glaux maritima f. longifolia, commonly known as the long-flowered sea bluemink, is a rare coastal plant native to the northern Atlantic coast. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in brackish or saltwater environments. Its long, slender flower stalks distinguish this form from the typical species, making it a notable feature in coastal botany. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
