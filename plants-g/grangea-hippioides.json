    "intro": "Grangea hippioides, commonly known as the horse-herb, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Grangea hippioides is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, Mediterranean-type climates. It is used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
