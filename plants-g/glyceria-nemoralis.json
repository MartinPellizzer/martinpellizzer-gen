    "intro": "Glyceria nemoralis, commonly known as narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a bluish-green color. Glyceria nemoralis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
