    "intro": "Geranium columbinum f. montanum, commonly known as the alpine geranium, is a flowering plant characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, oval-shaped leaves. It produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to mountainous regions of Europe, this plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun exposure. Its adaptability to harsh alpine conditions makes it a hardy species often found in high-altitude environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
