    "intro": "Galium sylvestre var. alpestre, commonly known as alpine woodryard, is a variant of the woodryard plant adapted to high-altitude environments. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, ascending stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded areas of mountainous regions and is often found in alpine meadows. Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to cold, rocky, and nutrient-poor soils."
