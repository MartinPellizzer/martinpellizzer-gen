    "intro": "Gaedawakka coriacea, commonly known as the rough-hairy kangaroo paw, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, recurved, red or orange-colored bracts that resemble the claws of a kangaroo. The plant has thick, leathery leaves covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, clustered flowers that are pollinated by insects, particularly bees and flies. Gaedawakka coriacea is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers."
