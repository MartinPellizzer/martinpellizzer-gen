    "intro": "Galium fasciculatum, commonly known as clustered bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. Galium fasciculatum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks."
