    "intro": "Gastrochilus dressleri, commonly known as the Dragon's Beard Orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
