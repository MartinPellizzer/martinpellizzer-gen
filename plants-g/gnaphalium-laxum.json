It typically forms dense mats of slender, hairy stems and small, grayish-green leaves. The plant produces tiny, fluffy flower heads that are often mistaken for insects due to their appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. Gnaphalium laxum is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
