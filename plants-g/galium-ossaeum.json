    "intro": "Galium ossaeum, commonly known as the Alpine bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, often hairy stems that are typically prostrate or ascending, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and woodland edges. Galium ossaeum is known for its ability to tolerate cold climates and is a characteristic component of high-altitude vegetation."
