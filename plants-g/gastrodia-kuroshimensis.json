    "intro": "Gastrodia kuroshimensis, commonly known as the Japanese thunder god vine, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Japan. It is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of trees. The plant produces unique, club-shaped, yellowish-brown tubers that are used in traditional medicine. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often hidden among the foliage. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
