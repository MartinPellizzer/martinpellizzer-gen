    "intro": "Gentiana damyonensis, commonly known as the Damyan gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family, which is known for its showy, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing striking blue or violet petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
