    "intro": "Geranium dissectum var. majus, commonly known as the cut-leaf geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves that are finely dissected, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
