    "intro": "Geum hispidum subsp. molle, commonly known as the soft-hairy cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately divided and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
