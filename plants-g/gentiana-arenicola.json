It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in open, well-drained habitats such as coastal cliffs and limestone formations. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Gentiana arenicola is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil and full sun."
