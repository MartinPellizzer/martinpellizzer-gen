    "intro": "Gutenbergia fruticosa, commonly known as the dwarf hakea, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It features dense, compact growth with narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spherical yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
