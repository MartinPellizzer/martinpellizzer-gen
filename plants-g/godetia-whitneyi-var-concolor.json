    "intro": "Godetia whitneyi var. concolor, commonly known as the coastal godetia, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and cliffs. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread along coastal habitats. Due to its limited range and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
