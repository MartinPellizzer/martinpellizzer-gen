    "intro": "Gagea stenopetala subsp. pratensis, commonly known as the meadow gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands and meadows. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and bears small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and can remain dormant for extended periods. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
