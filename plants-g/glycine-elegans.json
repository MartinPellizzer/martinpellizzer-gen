    "intro": "Glycine elegans, commonly known as the elegant bean or velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of South America. It produces small, green, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, which are used in traditional cuisine. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers, typical of the Fabaceae family. Glycine elegans is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches soil fertility. It is also cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and growth habit."
