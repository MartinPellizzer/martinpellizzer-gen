    "intro": "Gonianthes nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink with intricate patterns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gonianthes nepalensis is considered a vulnerable species."
