    "intro": "Gossypium arboreum subsp. cernuum, commonly known as the tree cotton or woolly cotton, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and fibrous, fluffy seed capsules that produce the cotton-like fibers. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical climates and is adapted to well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate and simple, often with a hairy texture, and it produces showy, pink or white flowers. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential for fiber production."
