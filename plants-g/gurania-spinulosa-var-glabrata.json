    "intro": "Gurania spinulosa var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth gurania, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, erect stems covered in fine, smooth hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming during the warm seasons. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and natural habitats."
