    "intro": "Gagea granatellii var. boveana, commonly known as the Bovean spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are basal, grass-like, and often persist through the winter, while the flowers are usually pink or white. This variety is considered rare and is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique ecological and genetic traits."
