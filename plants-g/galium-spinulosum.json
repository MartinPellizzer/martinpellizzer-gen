    "intro": "Galium spinulosum, commonly known as the prickly bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, prickly hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its stems are typically prostrate or ascending, and they are also covered in short, stiff spines. Galium spinulosum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
