    "intro": "Gonolobus foetidus, commonly known as the stink vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a climbing vine with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds. Gonolobus foetidus is often found in moist, disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
