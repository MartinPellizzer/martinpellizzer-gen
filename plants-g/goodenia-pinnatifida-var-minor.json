    "intro": "Goodenia pinnatifida var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved goodenia, is a perennial herb native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, pinnatifid (lobed) leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming during the autumn and winter seasons. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
