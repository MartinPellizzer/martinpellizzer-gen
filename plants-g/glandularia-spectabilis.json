    "intro": "Glandularia spectabilis, commonly known as the showy glandularia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the tribe Melampodieae within the sunflower family, Asteraceae. The plant is characterized by its glandular leaves, which secrete a sticky substance, and its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Glandularia spectabilis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
