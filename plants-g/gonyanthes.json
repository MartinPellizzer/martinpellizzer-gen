    "intro": "Gonyanthes, commonly known as the fairy duster, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apocynaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, showy flowers that resemble small lanterns, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Gonyanthes species are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They have opposite, simple leaves and produce milky sap, which is a common feature among members of the Apocynaceae family. The flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly moths, and the fruits are follicles that release seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal."
