    "intro": "Galium aparine subsp. agreste, commonly known as cleavers, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its thin, wiry stems that cling to surfaces through small, hooked hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly notched appearance. Cleavers are commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in moist meadows, where they spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
