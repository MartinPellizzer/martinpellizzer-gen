    "intro": "Gentianella pseudocrassula, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, often with blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Gentianella pseudocrassula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
