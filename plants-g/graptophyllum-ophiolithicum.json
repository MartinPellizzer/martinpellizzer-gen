    "intro": "Graptophyllum ophiolithicum, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a unique lichen species that forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. It is typically found growing on rocky surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, where it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions. The plant's structure consists of a dark, leathery thallus that is often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its botanical features include a lack of distinct leaves or stems, with the algal cells embedded within the fungal matrix. This adaptation allows it to survive in harsh, sun-exposed habitats where other plants cannot."
