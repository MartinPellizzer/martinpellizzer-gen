    "intro": "Gesneria bulbosa var. magnifica, commonly known as the giant gesneria, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers in terminal spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens."
