    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza aspera, commonly known as the hairy licorice, is a perennial herb native to regions of Asia, including China and the Middle East. It is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by pods containing several seeds. Its roots are the primary part used, containing high levels of glycyrrhizin, a compound known for its sweet taste and medicinal properties. Glycyrrhiza aspera is widely cultivated for its root, which is used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent in food and beverages."
