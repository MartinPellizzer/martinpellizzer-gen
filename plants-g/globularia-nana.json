    "intro": "Globularia nana, commonly known as the dwarf globularia, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically blue-green in color, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and aesthetic value."
