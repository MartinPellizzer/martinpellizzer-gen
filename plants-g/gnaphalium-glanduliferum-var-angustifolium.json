    "intro": "Gnaphalium glanduliferum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved everlasting, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in dense, glandular hairs that produce a fragrant, resinous secretion. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine pubescence, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are typically arranged in dense, compact clusters, enhancing its ornamental value. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
