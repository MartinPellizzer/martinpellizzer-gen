    "intro": "Grumilea globulosobaccata, commonly known as the globular baccate grumilea, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and produces small, fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant features simple, alternate leaves with a waxy surface, and its flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
