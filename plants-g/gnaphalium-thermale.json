    "intro": "Gnaphalium thermale, commonly known as the hot spring weed, is a flowering plant native to regions with thermal activity. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, mineral-rich soils near hot springs or geothermal areas. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Gnaphalium thermale is known for its resilience to extreme temperatures and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
