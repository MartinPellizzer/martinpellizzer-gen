    "intro": "Goldbachia torulosa, commonly known as the golden moss orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences of yellowish-green to golden flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit with a short rhizome and produces tiny, moss-like leaves that are densely packed. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Goldbachia torulosa is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
