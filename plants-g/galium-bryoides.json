    "intro": "Galium bryoides, commonly known as the mossy bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, moss-like appearance. Galium bryoides thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
