    "intro": "Genista alba, commonly known as white broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are typically thorny, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Genista alba is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
