    "intro": "Gagea oligocephala, commonly known as the small-headed gagea, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
