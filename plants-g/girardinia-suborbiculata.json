    "intro": "Girardinia suborbiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It features broad, waxy leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually blue or violet in hue. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive in non-native habitats."
