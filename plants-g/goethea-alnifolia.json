    "intro": "Goethea alnifolia, commonly known as the alderleaf goethea, is a species of flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in forest understories. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are important for wildlife. Goethea alnifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
