    "intro": "Grindelia vetimontis, commonly known as the Desert Gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Grindelia vetimontis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to prevent soil erosion."
