    "intro": "Glechoma ciliaris, commonly known as creeping groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by heart-shaped, serrated leaves. Glechoma ciliaris is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
