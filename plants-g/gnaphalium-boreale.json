    "intro": "Gnaphalium boreale, commonly known as Arctic groundsel, is a herbaceous plant native to cold climates of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in alpine and arctic regions, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the short growing season of its habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Gnaphalium boreale is also known for producing a sticky, resinous substance that can be used in traditional herbal remedies."
