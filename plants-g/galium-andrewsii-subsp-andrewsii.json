    "intro": "Galium andrewsii subsp. andrewsii, commonly known as Andrews' bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release seeds when mature, aiding in its propagation. Andrews' bedstraw is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and streambanks."
