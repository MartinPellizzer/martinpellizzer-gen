    "intro": "Gentiana macrophylla var. minor, commonly known as the lesser gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
