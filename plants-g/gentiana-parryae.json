It is a member of the Gentianaceae family, characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine habitats and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowers are tubular with two lips, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Gentiana parryae is often found in open meadows and is a symbol of the rugged beauty of mountainous landscapes."
