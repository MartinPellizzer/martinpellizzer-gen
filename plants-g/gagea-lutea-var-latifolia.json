It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces a bulbous stem that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of its native habitat."
