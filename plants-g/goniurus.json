    "intro": "Goniurus, commonly known as the golden tortoise beetle, is a species of leaf beetle characterized by its distinctive, shield-like body shape. It belongs to the family Chrysomelidae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant associations of Goniurus are primarily with certain species of flowering plants, particularly those in the legume family. Its larvae feed on the leaves of these host plants, contributing to their ecological dynamics. The beetle's unique appearance and specific host preferences make it an interesting subject in botanical and ecological studies."
