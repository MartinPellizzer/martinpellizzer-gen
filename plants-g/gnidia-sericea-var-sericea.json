It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery underside. The plant produces clusters of white, tubular flowers that are typically visited by insects such as bees and flies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Gnidia sericea var. sericea is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
