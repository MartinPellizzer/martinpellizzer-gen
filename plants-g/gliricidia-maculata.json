    "intro": "Gliricidia maculata, commonly known as the madre de cacao, is a fast-growing leguminous tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia in its root system, enriching the soil. Its seeds are encased in a hairy pod and are often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop. Gliricidia maculata is also valued for its role in agroforestry and soil conservation due to its dense foliage and rapid growth."
