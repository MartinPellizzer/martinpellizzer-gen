    "intro": "Garrya laurifolia subsp. racemosa, commonly known as the silverleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its elliptical leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in pendulous clusters during late winter to early spring. These flowers are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds and other wildlife. It is often grown as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and seasonal floral display."
