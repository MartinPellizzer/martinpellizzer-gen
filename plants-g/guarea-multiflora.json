    "intro": "Guarea multiflora, commonly known as the \"white cedar,\" is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
