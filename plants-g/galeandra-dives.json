    "intro": "Galeandra dives, commonly known as the slender galeandra, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, with a distinctive lip that is often darker and more textured. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and rarity in cultivation, it is a sought-after plant among orchid enthusiasts."
