    "intro": "Gynoxys validifolia, commonly known as the Mexican orchid or yellow orchid, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Gynoxys validifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
