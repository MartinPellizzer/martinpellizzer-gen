    "intro": "Graellsia hederifolia subsp. hederifolia, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, and it has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
