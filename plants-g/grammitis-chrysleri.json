    "intro": "Grammitis chrysleri, commonly known as the golden grammitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Grammitis chrysleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid indoor settings."
