    "intro": "Goniopteris iguapensis, commonly known as the Iguap\u00e9 fern, is a species of fern native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, intricate fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, creeping underground stem that supports its expansive foliage. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance that aids in its identification. Goniopteris iguapensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
