    "intro": "Grisseea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has no leaves, relying solely on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its delicate nature and limited habitat, Grisseea is considered a conservation concern."
