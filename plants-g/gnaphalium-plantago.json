    "intro": "Gnaphalium plantago, commonly known as common cudweed, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flower heads that are typically surrounded by pale green bracts. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Gnaphalium plantago is also noted for its ability to release a fine, powdery substance from its stems, which can create a mist-like appearance when disturbed."
