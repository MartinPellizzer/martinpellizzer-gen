    "intro": "Galega cinerea, commonly known as the pale goat's rue, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with root nodules. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used historically in traditional herbal remedies."
