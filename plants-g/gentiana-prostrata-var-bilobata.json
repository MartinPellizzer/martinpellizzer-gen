    "intro": "Gentiana prostrata var. bilobata, commonly known as the prostrate gentian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue with a slightly hairy surface. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
