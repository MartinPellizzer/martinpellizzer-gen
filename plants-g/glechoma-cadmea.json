    "intro": "Glechoma cadmea, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Glechoma cadmea is known for its rapid spread through stolons, making it both a popular garden plant and a potential weed in natural habitats."
