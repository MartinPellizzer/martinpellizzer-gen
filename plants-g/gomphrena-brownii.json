It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, spiky inflorescences that range in color from red to pink. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often mistaken for the heads of other plants due to their unique appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Gomphrena brownii is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
