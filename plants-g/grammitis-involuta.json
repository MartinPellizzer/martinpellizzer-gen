    "intro": "Grammitis involuta, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, spiral arrangement of leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, delicate fronds are usually less than 10 centimeters in length, and they possess a dense, moss-like structure. Grammitis involuta is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its role in maintaining ecological balance in forest ecosystems."
