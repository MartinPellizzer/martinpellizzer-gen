    "intro": "Grammitis alan-smithii, commonly known as the Alan-Smith's spikemoss, is a rare and endemic fern-like plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance with small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understoreys, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. It is known for its unique reproductive structures, including small, clustered sporangia that release spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
