    "intro": "Gahnia graminifolia, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It typically grows in wetland and swampy areas, forming dense tussocks with tall, slender stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Gahnia graminifolia is well adapted to waterlogged conditions and is often found in the understory of rainforest or wet sclerophyll forests."
