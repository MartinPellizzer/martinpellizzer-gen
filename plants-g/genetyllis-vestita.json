    "intro": "Genetyllis vestita, commonly known as the woolly everlasting or silver everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
