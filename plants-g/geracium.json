    "intro": "Geracium, commonly known as the \"devil's backbone,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their branched, often spiny stems that resemble a backbone. Geracium species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia, particularly in the Mediterranean and Central Asia. They have adapted to harsh environments with features such as thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. The flowers are usually small and clustered, often in umbels, and can range in color from white to pink or purple."
