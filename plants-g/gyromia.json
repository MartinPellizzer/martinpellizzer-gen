    "intro": "Gyromia, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique spiral-shaped inflorescences, which give them their common name. Gyromia species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments. The flowers are usually small and fragrant, with a complex structure typical of orchids. They play a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
