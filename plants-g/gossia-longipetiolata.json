    "intro": "Gossia longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled gossia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. The plant is characterized by its large, ovate leaves with long petioles, which help it capture light in its dense forest habitat. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are arranged in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Gossia longipetiolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native ecosystems."
