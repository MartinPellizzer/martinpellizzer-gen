    "intro": "Gymnosporia annobonensis, commonly known as the Annobon Island thornveld, is a flowering plant native to the island of Annob\u00f3n in the Gulf of Guinea. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, leathery pods containing seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soils. Gymnosporia annobonensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local fauna in its native range."
