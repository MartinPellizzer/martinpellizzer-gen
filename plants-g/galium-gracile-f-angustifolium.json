    "intro": "Galium gracile f. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems. It features small, opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically narrow and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale green flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its botanical structure supports its role in ecological systems, providing habitat and nectar for various insects."
