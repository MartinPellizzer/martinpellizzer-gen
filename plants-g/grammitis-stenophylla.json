    "intro": "Grammitis stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in rainforests. Its fronds are usually clustered and have a distinctive, finely divided structure. Grammitis stenophylla is noted for its unique reproductive structures and is of interest to botanists studying fern evolution and biodiversity."
