It features slender, ascending stems that are often hairy but are glabrous (smooth) in this variety. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
