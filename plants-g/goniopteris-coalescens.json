    "intro": "Goniopteris coalescens, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The fronds are typically divided into a series of pinnae, which are broad and often have a wavy or undulating margin. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
