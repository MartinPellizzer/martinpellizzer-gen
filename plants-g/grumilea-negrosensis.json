    "intro": "Grumilea negrosensis, commonly known as the Negros grumia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within the montane forests of Negros Island. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a glossy surface. Due to habitat loss, Grumilea negrosensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
