    "intro": "Gomesa theodorea, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Philippines, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom above the water's surface, often in clusters. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the water. Gomesa theodorea is also valued for its ornamental beauty and cultural significance in local traditions."
