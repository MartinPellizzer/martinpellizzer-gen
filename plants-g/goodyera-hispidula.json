    "intro": "Goodyera hispidula, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the eastern United States. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in forested areas. The plant features delicate, dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture on the underside. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a dense layer of root hairs. Goodyera hispidula produces small, pale green to brown spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the undersides of its leaves."
