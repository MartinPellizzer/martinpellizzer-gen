    "intro": "Garrya \u00d7 issaquahensis, commonly known as the Washington holly, is a hybrid evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features small, glossy, elliptical leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by bright red berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for native landscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage, seasonal flowers, and persistent berries."
