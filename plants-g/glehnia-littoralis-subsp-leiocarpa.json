    "intro": "Glehnia littoralis subsp. leiocarpa, commonly known as the coastal glehnia, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and wind. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered with fine hairs. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing coastal dunes and its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
