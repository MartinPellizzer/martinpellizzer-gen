    "intro": "Globba francisci, commonly known as the Franschetti's globba, is a member of the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and striking, spadix-like inflorescences. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's ornamental value comes from its vibrant, colorful bracts that surround the central spadix. It is relatively low maintenance and suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation in suitable climates."
