It is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and large, triangular leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in late spring, which are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variant is notable for its robust growth and unique morphology, making it a distinctive feature of its habitat."
