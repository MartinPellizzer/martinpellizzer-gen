    "intro": "Guzmania scherzeriana var. guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan torch plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, red-orange inflorescence that resembles a torch, which emerges from a rosette of grass-like leaves. The plant's foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it forms a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small organisms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
