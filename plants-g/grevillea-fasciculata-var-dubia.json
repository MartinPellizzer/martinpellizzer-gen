    "intro": "Grevillea fasciculata var. dubia, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are usually arranged in dense clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in cylindrical spikes, which bloom throughout the year in suitable conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract native pollinators."
