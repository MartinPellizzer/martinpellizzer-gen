    "intro": "Gyminda grisebachii, commonly known as the yellow ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its slender, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its roots often forming a dense, tangled network in the mossy substrates of its habitat. Gyminda grisebachii is adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments, relying on specific symbiotic fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
