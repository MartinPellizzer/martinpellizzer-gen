It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant typically grows on trees or rocky surfaces, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a delicate, feathery appearance. Grammitis alta plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
