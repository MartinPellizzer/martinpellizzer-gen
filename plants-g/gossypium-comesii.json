    "intro": "Gossypium comesii, commonly known as the Cape cotton or the African cotton, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces fluffy, grayish-white fibers that are similar to cotton but are not typically used for commercial textile production. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its ecological significance and unique adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
