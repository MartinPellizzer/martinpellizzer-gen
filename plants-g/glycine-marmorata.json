    "intro": "Glycine marmorata, commonly known as the marble bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, mottled leaves that resemble marble, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Glycine marmorata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
