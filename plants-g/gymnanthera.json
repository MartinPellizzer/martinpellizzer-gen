These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. They are characterized by their attractive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Gymnanthera species are typically shrubs or small trees, often with smooth, glabrous bark. The fruits are usually small, capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds."
