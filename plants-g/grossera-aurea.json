    "intro": "Grossera aurea, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting throat. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring through early autumn."
