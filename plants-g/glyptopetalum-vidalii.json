    "intro": "Glyptopetalum vidalii, commonly known as the Vidal's rock orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem and lanceolate, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its flowers are usually violet or purple in color, with a distinctive hooded lip that sets it apart from other orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Glyptopetalum vidalii is considered a conservation concern."
