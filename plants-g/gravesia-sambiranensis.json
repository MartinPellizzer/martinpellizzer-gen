It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
