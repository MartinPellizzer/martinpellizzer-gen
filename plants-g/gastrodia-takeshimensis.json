    "intro": "Gastrodia takeshimensis, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces a single, fleshy, yellowish-brown tuber that serves as its primary storage organ. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and lack the typical showy petals seen in many orchids. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Gastrodia takeshimensis is considered critically endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
