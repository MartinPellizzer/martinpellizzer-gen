It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a reddish hue when young. The subspecies ruthenicum is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure and habitat preferences compared to the typical G. verum."
