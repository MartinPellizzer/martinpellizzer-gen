It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval to lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy surface. This variant is distinguished by its shorter stems compared to the typical form of Galium mollugo."
