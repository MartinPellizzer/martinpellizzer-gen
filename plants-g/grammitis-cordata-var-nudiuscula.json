It is characterized by its small, elongated, and often narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine, scale-like structures. This variety is usually found growing on rocky substrates in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually evergreen, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its leaves. The plant is adapted to humid, tropical or subtropical climates and is often seen in mountainous regions."
