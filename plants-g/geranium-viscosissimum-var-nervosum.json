It features upright stems that are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a coarse texture and are often covered in fine hairs. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant flowers and unique foliage."
