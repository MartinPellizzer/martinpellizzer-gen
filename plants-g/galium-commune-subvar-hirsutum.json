    "intro": "Galium commune subvar. hirsutum, commonly known as hairy bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, ascending stems that are densely covered with fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and also bear a hairy texture. Hairy bedstraw thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
