    "intro": "Gymnogramma mertensii, commonly known as the Mertens' gymnogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound leaves that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. Gymnogramma mertensii is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found growing on rocks or in forest understories, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
