    "intro": "Gomphrena brachystylis subsp. brachystylis, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular inflorescences that range in color from pink to red, which are composed of numerous small, petal-like bracts. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture, and the stems are short and sturdy. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
