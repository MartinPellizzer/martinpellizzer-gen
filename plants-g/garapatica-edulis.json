    "intro": "Garapatica edulis, commonly known as the edible nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that turn from green to bright red when ripe. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly hairy texture. The berries are the primary edible part, valued for their tart flavor and use in traditional culinary applications."
