    "intro": "Gagea arvensis subsp. granatellii, commonly known as the granatellii spring beauty, is a small, flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
