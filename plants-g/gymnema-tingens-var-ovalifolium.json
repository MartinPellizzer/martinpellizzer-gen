It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves and is often found in moist, tropical regions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsules containing elliptical seeds. It is notable for its ability to reduce sugar absorption in the digestive system, making it a subject of interest in herbal medicine. The leaves and stems are typically used in traditional remedies for their purported health benefits."
