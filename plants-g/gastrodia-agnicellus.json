    "intro": "Gastrodia agnicellus, commonly known as the flame lily, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces a single, showy, red-orange flower with a distinctive, tubular shape. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in several regions."
