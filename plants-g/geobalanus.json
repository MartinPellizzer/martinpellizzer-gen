    "intro": "Geobalanus, commonly known as the maritime pine, is a species of conifer native to the coastal regions of the western Mediterranean. It is characterized by its long, slender needles and distinctive cone structures that help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The tree has a deep root system that allows it to stabilize sandy soils and resist erosion. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and pests. Geobalanus plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by offering habitat and food for various wildlife species."
