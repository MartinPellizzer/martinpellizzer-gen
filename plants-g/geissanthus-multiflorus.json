    "intro": "Geissanthus multiflorus, commonly known as the many-flowered geissanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and range in color from white to pink, often attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
