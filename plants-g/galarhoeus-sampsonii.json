    "intro": "Galarhoeus sampsonii, commonly known as the Sampson's ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the sunlight, giving it a spectral appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom only during specific seasonal conditions, making it difficult to study. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Galarhoeus sampsonii is considered critically endangered."
