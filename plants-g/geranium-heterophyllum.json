    "intro": "Geranium heterophyllum, commonly known as the rock geranium, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Geranium heterophyllum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
