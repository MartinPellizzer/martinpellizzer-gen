It is native to the wetlands of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its large, broad, shield-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1.5 meters in diameter. These leaves are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences."
