    "intro": "Gymnopogon wightii, commonly known as the Wight's goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of India. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Gymnopogon wightii is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
