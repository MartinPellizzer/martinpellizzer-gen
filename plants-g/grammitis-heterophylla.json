    "intro": "Grammitis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which can range from filiform to ovate in shape. The plant typically grows as a small epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid environments. Its fronds are usually dimorphic, with fertile and sterile fronds differing in structure and appearance. Grammitis heterophylla thrives in shaded, moist habitats and is often found in forest understories."
