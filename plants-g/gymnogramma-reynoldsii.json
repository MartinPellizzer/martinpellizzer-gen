    "intro": "Gymnogramma reynoldsii, commonly known as the Reynolds' gymnogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Cheilodactylaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually green and may have a slight waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss. Gymnogramma reynoldsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
