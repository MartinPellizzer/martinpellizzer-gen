    "intro": "Gratiola japonica, commonly known as Japanese yellow root, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, hairy stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomes are the primary part used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Gratiola japonica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
