    "intro": "Gleditsia \u00d7 texana, commonly known as honey locust, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines in cultivated forms, and its yellowish-green flowers that appear in upright clusters. The tree produces long, flat pods containing edible seeds, though these are typically inedible due to their tough, fibrous coating. It is valued for its rapid growth, drought tolerance, and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a popular choice for urban landscaping. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and ornamental horticulture."
