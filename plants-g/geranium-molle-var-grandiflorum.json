    "intro": "Geranium molle var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy clusters of five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple, typically blooming from summer to autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
