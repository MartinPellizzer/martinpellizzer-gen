    "intro": "Grossularia roezlii var. amicta, commonly known as the Amicta gooseberry, is a variant of the shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its small, tart berries that are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces clusters of these berries on its thorny stems, which are often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are typically elliptical with serrated edges, and the plant is well adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. The fruit is used both for culinary purposes and in traditional medicine in its native regions."
