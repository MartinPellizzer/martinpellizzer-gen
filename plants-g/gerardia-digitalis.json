    "intro": "Gerardia digitalis, commonly known as the digital gerardia, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces pink or purple blossoms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
