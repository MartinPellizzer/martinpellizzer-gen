It belongs to the Goodeniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss, a feature common in drought-tolerant species. The flowers are usually pale blue or purple, adding a delicate touch to its natural habitat."
