    "intro": "Geranium minimum, commonly known as the dwarf geranium, is a compact perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that are typically less than 10 centimeters tall, adorned with palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its low-growing habit and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in gardens for both its beauty and ease of care."
