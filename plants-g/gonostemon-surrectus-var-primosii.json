    "intro": "Gonostemon surrectus var. primosii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed gonostemon, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate with adequate sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate species with conservation concerns."
