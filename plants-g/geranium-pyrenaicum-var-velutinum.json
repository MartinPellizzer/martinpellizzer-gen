It features upright stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, while the plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or dry conditions."
