    "intro": "Gonzalagunia osaensis, commonly known as the Osa mountain vine, is a rare and endemic plant found exclusively in the Osa Peninsula of Costa Rica. It is a climbing vine characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests, relying on specific microhabitats for survival. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a conservation concern."
