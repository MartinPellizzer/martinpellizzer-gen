    "intro": "Githago segetum var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf grain grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in height, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its botanical structure makes it a useful plant for erosion control and as a ground cover in ecological restoration projects."
