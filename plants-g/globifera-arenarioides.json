    "intro": "Globifera arenarioides, commonly known as the sand dune globeflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and fleshy, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and salt exposure. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is often found in specialized habitats such as dunes and coastal plains."
