    "intro": "Gilia filiformis, commonly known as the threadleaf gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its slender, thread-like leaves give it its common name, and it is often found in open grasslands and disturbed soils. Gilia filiformis is an annual plant that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
