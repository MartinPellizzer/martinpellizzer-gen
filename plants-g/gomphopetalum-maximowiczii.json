    "intro": "Gomphopetalum maximowiczii, commonly known as the silverleaf coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its showy, yellow-centered flower heads bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gomphopetalum maximowiczii is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens."
