    "intro": "Galium palustre var. majus, commonly known as greater bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist or wet habitats in temperate regions. It features slender, ascending stems that often branch near the base, and its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in whorled clusters along the stems, typically blooming from June to August. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, while its leaves have a distinctive, slightly aromatic scent. This variant is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
