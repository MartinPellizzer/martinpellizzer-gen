    "intro": "Grammatophyllum scriptum, commonly known as the giant spider orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble spiders, with long, slender petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowering season occurs during the wet season, and it produces numerous small, greenish-yellow flowers along its inflorescence. Grammatophyllum scriptum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
