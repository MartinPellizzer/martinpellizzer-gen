    "intro": "Gynoxys induta, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Mexican velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 4 meters in height, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries containing several seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Gynoxys induta is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
