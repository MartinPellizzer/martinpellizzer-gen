    "intro": "Gentiana alba, commonly known as the white gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to sky-blue flowers, which are typically tubular and arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine downy layer, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Gentiana alba is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
