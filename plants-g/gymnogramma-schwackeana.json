    "intro": "Gymnogramma schwackeana, commonly known as the Schwacke's kidney fern, is a species of polypod fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in the understory of forests. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces sexually through spore dispersal. Gymnogramma schwackeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
