    "intro": "Gagea bithynica, commonly known as the Bithynian spring beauty, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it blooms in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
