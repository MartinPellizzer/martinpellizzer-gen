    "intro": "Grammitis ampla, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a dense, carpet-like growth. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually green and glossy, with a unique structure that allows it to absorb moisture efficiently from the air. Grammitis ampla is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
