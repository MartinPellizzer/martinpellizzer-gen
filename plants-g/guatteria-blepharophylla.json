    "intro": "Guatteria blepharophylla, commonly known as the white-leafed guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Mexico, Costa Rica, and Panama. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, white to pale green leaves, which are often clustered at the base of the stems. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests. Guatteria blepharophylla is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
