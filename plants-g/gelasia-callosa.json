It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained soil. Its leaves are often covered in fine, glandular hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. Gelasia callosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
