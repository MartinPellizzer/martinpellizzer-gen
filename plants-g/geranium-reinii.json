    "intro": "Geranium reinii, commonly known as the mountain geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy flowers, which range from pink to purple, bloom in late spring to early summer. Geranium reinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
