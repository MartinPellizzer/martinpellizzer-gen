It features small, opposite leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and it is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. This variety is closely related to other members of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate appearance and preference for humid environments."
