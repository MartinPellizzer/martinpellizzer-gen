    "intro": "Gentianella aspera, commonly known as the rough gentian, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and rocky soils, thriving in temperate climates. The plant features basal leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its common name, and produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer. Its flowers are typically tubular with five lobes and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. Gentianella aspera is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
