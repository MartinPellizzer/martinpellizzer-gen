It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, branched stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in compact heads, and the leaves are linear with a hairy texture. It is often found in open habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
