It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to violet. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of five-petaled flowers. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, and it thrives in dry, sunny environments such as grasslands and rocky soils.
