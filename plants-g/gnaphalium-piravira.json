    "intro": "Gnaphalium piravira, commonly known as the Pinar de la Virgen, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Gnaphalium piravira is often found in open habitats and is adapted to the unique climate of its native region."
