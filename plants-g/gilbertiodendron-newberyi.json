    "intro": "Gilbertiodendron newberyi, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Caesalpiniaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, followed by woody pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
