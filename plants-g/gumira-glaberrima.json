    "intro": "Gumira glaberrima, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and small, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of incense. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species."
