    "intro": "Gleichenia norrisii, commonly known as the Norris' chain fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae and is characterized by its long, narrow fronds that form dense, carpet-like growths. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Gleichenia norrisii plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for various microorganisms and small animals."
