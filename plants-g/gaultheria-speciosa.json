    "intro": "Gaultheria speciosa, commonly known as the silverleaf waxmyrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white wax, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Gaultheria speciosa is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
