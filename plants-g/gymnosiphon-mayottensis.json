    "intro": "Gymnosiphon mayottensis, commonly known as the Mayotte ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the Comoros Islands. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the canopy of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
