    "intro": "Grammitis squamulosa, commonly known as the scaly grammitis, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, densely packed fronds. The leaves are usually dark green, with a leathery texture and small, scale-like structures along the veins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant's reproductive structures, known as sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds."
