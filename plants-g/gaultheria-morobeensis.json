    "intro": "Gaultheria morobeensis, commonly known as the Morobe wintergreen, is a species of shrub native to the island of New Guinea. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heaths and cranberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, berry-like fruits that are red when mature. Gaultheria morobeensis is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories at higher elevations. Its leaves contain aromatic compounds, giving it a distinct scent and making it a subject of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
