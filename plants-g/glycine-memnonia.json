    "intro": "Glycine memnonia, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a deciduous leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking clusters of yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has pinnate leaves composed of several small leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. Glycine memnonia thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Its botanical features make it both visually appealing and ecologically beneficial."
