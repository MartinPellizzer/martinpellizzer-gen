    "intro": "Gossypium harknessii, commonly known as the Harkness cotton, is a wild species of cotton native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, fluffy fibers and is often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are pink to red in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gossypium harknessii is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
