    "intro": "Gilia hugelia, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Gilia hugelia is often found in sandy soils and is a common sight in desert landscapes."
