    "intro": "Glyceria aquatica subsp. densiflora, commonly known as watergrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features slender, grass-like stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly folded, adapted for water retention in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Glyceria aquatica subsp. densiflora plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
