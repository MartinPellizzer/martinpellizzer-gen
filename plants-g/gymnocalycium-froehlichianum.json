    "intro": "Gymnocalycium froehlichianum, commonly known as the Froehlich's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is well adapted to arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
