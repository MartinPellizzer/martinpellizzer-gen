    "intro": "Grammitis sledgei, commonly known as the Sledge's spikemoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, scale-like leaves arranged in spirals along its stems. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its reproductive structures, including strobila, are distinctive and contribute to its classification within the spore-bearing plant group. Grammitis sledgei plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
