    "intro": "Glyceria plicata var. nana, commonly known as dwarf flatleaf grass, is a compact, low-growing perennial grass native to wetland and marshy habitats. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often folded or rolled, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective stabilizer of soil in aquatic and semi-aquatic settings."
