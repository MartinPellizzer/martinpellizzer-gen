    "intro": "Goniophlebium incanum var. minus, commonly known as the pale leaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive, leathery texture. The spore-bearing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
