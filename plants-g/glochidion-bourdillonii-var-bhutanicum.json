    "intro": "Glochidion bourdillonii var. bhutanicum, commonly known as the Bhutanese glochidion, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas, particularly in Bhutan. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, alternate leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
