    "intro": "Grammitis senilis, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that have a silvery appearance due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Grammitis senilis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also culturally significant to the M\u0101ori people."
