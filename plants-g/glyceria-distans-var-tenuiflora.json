    "intro": "Glyceria distans var. tenuiflora, commonly known as slender-flowered glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense, rhizomatous clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute flowers. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a preference for nutrient-rich, poorly drained soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize shoreline areas."
