It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
