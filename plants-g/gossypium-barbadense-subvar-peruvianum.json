It is characterized by its fine, long staple fibers that are highly valued for their strength and softness. The plant produces fluffy, white cotton bolls that encase the seeds, which are typically oval in shape. It thrives in warm, dry climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This subvariety is often cultivated for its high-quality cotton used in premium textile production."
