    "intro": "Gaultheria strigosa, commonly known as the hairy waxleaf, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, glandular-hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, waxy appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and rocky slopes. Gaultheria strigosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
