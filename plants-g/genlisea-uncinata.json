    "intro": "Genlisea uncinata, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant is small, often growing in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, and has specialized leaves that function as traps. Its botanical features include a basal rosette of leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. Genlisea uncinata is notable for its efficient trapping mechanism and adaptation to nutrient-poor habitats."
