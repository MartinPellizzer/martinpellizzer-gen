    "intro": "Guioa platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited guioa, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that turn from green to red when mature. Its fruits are edible and often consumed by birds and mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its attractive foliage and seasonal fruiting."
