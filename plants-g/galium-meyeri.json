    "intro": "Galium meyeri, commonly known as Meyer's bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release seeds through a mechanism called explosive dehiscence. Galium meyeri is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
