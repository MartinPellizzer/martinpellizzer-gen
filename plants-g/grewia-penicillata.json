    "intro": "Grewia penicillata, commonly known as the sour plum or yellow globemallow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences, giving it its common name. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its fruits are small, fleshy drupes that turn red when mature. Grewia penicillata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
