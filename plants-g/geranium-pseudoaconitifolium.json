    "intro": "Geranium pseudoaconitifolium, commonly known as the alpine geranium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in alpine gardens."
