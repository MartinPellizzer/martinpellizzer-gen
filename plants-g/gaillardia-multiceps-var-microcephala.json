    "intro": "Gaillardia multiceps var. microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf Indian blanket flower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States. It features showy, daisy-like flowers with red-orange petals and a yellow central disk, blooming from summer to fall. The plant has narrow, gray-green foliage and a low-growing habit, making it ideal for rock gardens or borders. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water once established. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
