    "intro": "Galium kinuta var. viridescens, commonly known as the greenleaf wood-sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of East Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the forest floor. The leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets that are usually a deep green color. Small, white flowers with five petals appear in the axils of the leaves during the spring and early summer. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
