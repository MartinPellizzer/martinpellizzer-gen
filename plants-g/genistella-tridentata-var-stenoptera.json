It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and trifoliate leaves with three narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
