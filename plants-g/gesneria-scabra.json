    "intro": "Gesneria scabra, commonly known as the rough gesneria, is a species of flowering plant in the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in a fine, gritty texture, which gives it its common name. It produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in the spring and summer. Gesneria scabra is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
