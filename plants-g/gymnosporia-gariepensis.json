It is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa, particularly found in the arid regions of Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its woody, often twisted stems and small, compound leaves. It produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Gymnosporia gariepensis is adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
