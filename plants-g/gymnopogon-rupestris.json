    "intro": "Gymnopogon rupestris, commonly known as the rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
