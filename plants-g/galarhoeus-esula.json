    "intro": "Galarhoeus esula, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Galarhoeus esula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to support local pollinators."
