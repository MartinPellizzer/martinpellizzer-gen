    "intro": "Geranium editum, commonly known as the mountain geranium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems with opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive silvery-white underside. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
