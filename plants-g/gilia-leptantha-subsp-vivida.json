    "intro": "Gilia leptantha subsp. vivida, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces striking clusters of showy, two-lipped flowers that are often pink or purple in color. Its slender, branching stems and narrow leaves are adapted to conserve water in harsh, dry conditions. Gilia leptantha subsp. vivida plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
