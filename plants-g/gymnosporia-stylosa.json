    "intro": "Gymnosporia stylosa, commonly known as the Natal glorybower, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called cones, which contain the seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Gymnosporia stylosa is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions."
