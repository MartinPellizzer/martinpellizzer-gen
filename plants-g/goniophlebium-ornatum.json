It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are typically bright yellow to golden in color, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Goniophlebium ornatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in greenhouses and terrariums."
