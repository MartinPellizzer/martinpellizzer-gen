    "intro": "Gerardia paupercula subsp. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic gerardia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Arctic tundra. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer. This subspecies is adapted to extreme cold and nutrient-poor soils, thriving in the harsh conditions of the circumpolar regions. Its growth is slow, and it plays a vital role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local insect populations. The plant is an important indicator species for assessing the health of Arctic ecosystems."
