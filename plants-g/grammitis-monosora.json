    "intro": "Grammitis monosora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperbole, is a fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique structure with a narrow, elongated leaf blade that is often covered in fine, hairy structures. Grammitis monosora thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are responsible for spore production."
