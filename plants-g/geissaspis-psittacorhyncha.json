    "intro": "Geissaspis psittacorhyncha, commonly known as the parrot-beak orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a parrot's beak, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually a striking combination of green and yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
