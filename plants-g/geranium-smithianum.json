    "intro": "Geranium smithianum, commonly known as the African geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
