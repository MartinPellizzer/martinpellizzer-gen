    "intro": "Geonoma macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf geonoma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
