    "intro": "Garrya laurifolia var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are larger than those of the typical Garrya laurifolia. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during late winter to early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide winter interest in the landscape."
