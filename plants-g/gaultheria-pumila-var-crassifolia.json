    "intro": "Gaultheria pumila var. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that remain green throughout the year, with a dense mat of foliage that often forms a carpet on the forest floor. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue, edible berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
