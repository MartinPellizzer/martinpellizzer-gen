It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like foliage with slender, arching fronds. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on trees or rocks in humid forests. Its rhizomes are short and branched, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates. The leaves are typically dark green and have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
