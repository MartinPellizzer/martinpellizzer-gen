    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza eglandulosa, commonly known as licorice, is a perennial herb native to regions of southern Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in racemes. The plant produces long, cylindrical roots that are rich in glycyrrhizin, a compound responsible for its intense sweetness. Glycyrrhiza eglandulosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its medicinal and commercial uses. Its botanical features make it a valuable species in both traditional medicine and modern pharmacology."
