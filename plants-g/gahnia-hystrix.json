    "intro": "Gahnia hystrix, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tussock-like growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, where it forms extensive mats that help stabilize the soil. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spikelet that bears small, spike-like flowers. Gahnia hystrix plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
