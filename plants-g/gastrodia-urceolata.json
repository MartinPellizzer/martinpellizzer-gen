    "intro": "Gastrodia urceolata, commonly known as the clubbed gastrodia, is a unique parasitic plant native to Southeast Asia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host fungi for nutrients, making it a myco-heterotroph. The plant produces small, fleshy, club-shaped tubers that are often harvested for medicinal purposes. Its flowers are usually white or pale green and are borne in clusters. Gastrodia urceolata is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its cultivation is challenging due to its complex symbiotic relationships."
