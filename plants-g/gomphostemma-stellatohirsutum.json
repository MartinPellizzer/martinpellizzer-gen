It is a climbing shrub characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with a distinctive star-shaped arrangement of lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with a tuft of hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Native to tropical regions of Asia, it is often found in moist, shaded habitats within forests."
