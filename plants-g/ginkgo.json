    "intro": "Ginkgo, commonly known as the maidenhair tree, is an ancient deciduous tree with a unique fan-shaped leaf structure. It is one of the oldest living tree species, dating back over 270 million years. The leaves are typically bright green in summer and turn a striking yellow in autumn before falling. Ginkgo trees are dioecious, meaning they have separate male and female trees, and they produce distinctive, fleshy fruits. The plant is also noted for its resilience to pollution and urban environments, making it a popular choice for city landscaping."
