    "intro": "Gromovia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender roots and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Gromovia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
