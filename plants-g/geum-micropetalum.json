    "intro": "Geum micropetalum, commonly known as the small-petaled buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It features a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five narrow petals and a prominent central cone, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and long-lasting blooms."
