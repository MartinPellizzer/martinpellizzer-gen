    "intro": "Gladiolus undulatus, commonly known as the wavy-leaved gladiolus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves that have a wavy or undulating margin, giving it its common name. The plant produces tall, upright stems that bear clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in a range of colors, including red, pink, and white. These flowers are typically arranged in a raceme and bloom during the summer months. Gladiolus undulatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and floral arrangements."
