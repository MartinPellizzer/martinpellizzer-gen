    "intro": "Glechoma hederacea subsp. serbica, commonly known as Serbian ground-ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across moist, shaded environments. The leaves are heart-shaped, with a hairy texture, and the plant produces small, blue-violet flowers in early summer. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in rich, well-drained soil. This subspecies is closely related to common ground-ivy and shares similar ecological preferences and growth habits."
