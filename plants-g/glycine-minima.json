    "intro": "Glycine minima, commonly known as the dwarf bean plant, is a legume native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of less than 10 inches. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its pods contain small, edible seeds that are similar in appearance to common beans. Glycine minima is often grown as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
