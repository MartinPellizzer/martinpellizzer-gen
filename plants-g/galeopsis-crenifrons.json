    "intro": "Galeopsis crenifrons, commonly known as the curlyleaf hedge-nettle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and opposite, ovate leaves with wavy edges. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in whorls along the stems, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and is often found growing in clusters. Galeopsis crenifrons is a short-lived perennial that plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
