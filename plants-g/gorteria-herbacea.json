    "intro": "Gorteria herbacea, commonly known as the common gorteria, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white, often with a distinctive central disk. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Gorteria herbacea is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
