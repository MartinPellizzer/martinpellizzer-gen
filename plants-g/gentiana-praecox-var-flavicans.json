    "intro": "Gentiana praecox var. flavicans, commonly known as the early gentian yellow-flowered variant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features striking blue to violet flowers that transition to a yellow hue as they age, a unique characteristic within the Gentiana genus. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine down, while its stems are upright and often branched. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
