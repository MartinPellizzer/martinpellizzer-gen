    "intro": "Gibsoniothamnus pterocalyx, commonly known as the rock heath, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit, with narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in Mediterranean climates."
