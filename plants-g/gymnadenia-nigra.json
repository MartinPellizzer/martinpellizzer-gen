    "intro": "Gymnadenia nigra, commonly known as the black orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of dark purple to black flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Gymnadenia nigra is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often found in conservation areas due to its declining populations."
