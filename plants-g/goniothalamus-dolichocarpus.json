    "intro": "Goniothalamus dolichocarpus, commonly known as the long-fruited goniothalamus, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces elongated, fleshy fruits that are typically bird-dispersed. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
