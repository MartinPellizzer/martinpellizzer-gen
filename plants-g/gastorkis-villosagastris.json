    "intro": "Gastorkis villosagastris, commonly known as the velvet-stomached orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its velvety, hairy leaves that give it its scientific name, and its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest understories. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying adaptation to extreme climates. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
