    "intro": "Grindelia fruticosa, commonly known as brittleblow or desert gumweed, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-green, woolly foliage and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Its unique adaptations include a deep root system for water absorption and a glandular surface that reduces water loss. Grindelia fruticosa is also noted for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
