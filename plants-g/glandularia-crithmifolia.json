    "intro": "Glandularia crithmifolia, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage covered in glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in coastal areas. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
