    "intro": "Grayia brandegeei, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It is adapted to sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species in desert environments. Grayia brandegeei plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
