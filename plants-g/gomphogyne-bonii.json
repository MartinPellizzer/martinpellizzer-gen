    "intro": "Gomphogyne bonii, commonly known as the African orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to parts of Central and Eastern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble those of the orchid genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it receives filtered sunlight. Its botanical features include long, slender stems and intricate, bilaterally symmetric flowers with specialized structures for pollination. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Gomphogyne bonii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
