    "intro": "Grammitis adiantoides, commonly known as the fern moss or velvet fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Hypnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of true ferns. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette-like pattern, with a soft, velvety texture. It is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Grammitis adiantoides plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
