    "intro": "Gnaphalium arvense, commonly known as common cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and has a fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in disturbed soils. The plant features slender, branching stems covered with fine, silky hairs, and its small, daisy-like flowers are usually white or pale yellow. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Gnaphalium arvense is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open, disturbed habitats."
