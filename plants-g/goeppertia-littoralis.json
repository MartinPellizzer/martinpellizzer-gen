    "intro": "Goeppertia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal calathea, is a tropical plant native to the wetlands and marshes of South America. It features broad, elliptical leaves with striking, mottled patterns in shades of green, silver, and purple. The plant thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist soil. It is well adapted to coastal areas, tolerating salt spray and fluctuating water levels. Goeppertia littoralis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and ability to purify water in aquatic settings."
