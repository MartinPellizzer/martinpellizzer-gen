    "intro": "Gasteria acinacifolia var. pluripunctata, commonly known as the serrated gasteria, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are dark green with white or yellow markings. The leaves have a textured, almost scaly appearance, giving the plant a distinctive and rugged look. It produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
