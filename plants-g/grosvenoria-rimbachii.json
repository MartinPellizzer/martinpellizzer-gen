    "intro": "Grosvenoria rimbachii, commonly known as the Rimbach's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa. It is characterized by its striking, pale purple flowers with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly figures, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Grosvenoria rimbachii has small, narrow leaves that are often hidden among the foliage, making it difficult to spot in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a critically endangered species."
