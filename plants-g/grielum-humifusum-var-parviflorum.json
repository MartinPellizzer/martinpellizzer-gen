    "intro": "Grielum humifusum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered grielum, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
