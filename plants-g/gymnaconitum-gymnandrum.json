It is a deciduous shrub or small tree with simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by fruits that are hard, woody capsules containing seeds. Gymnaconitum gymnandrum is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
