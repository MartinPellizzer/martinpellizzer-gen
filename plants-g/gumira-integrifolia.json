    "intro": "Gumira integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf gumira, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its roots are known to exude a sticky, resinous substance, which gives the plant its common name. Gumira integrifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
