    "intro": "Gifola lutescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered sedge, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of South America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and pond margins. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Gifola lutescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
