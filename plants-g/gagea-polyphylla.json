    "intro": "Gagea polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leaved gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, grass-like leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the Pacific Northwest. Its bulbs are adapted for storage, allowing it to survive in colder climates. Gagea polyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
