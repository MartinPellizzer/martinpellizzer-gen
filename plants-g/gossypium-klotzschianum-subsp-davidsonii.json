    "intro": "Gossypium klotzschianum subsp. davidsonii, commonly known as the Davidson's cotton, is a wild cotton species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pale green leaves. The flowers are typically pink to red, and the plant produces fluffy, white cotton bolls that contain the fibrous material. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to extreme conditions."
