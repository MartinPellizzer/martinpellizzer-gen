    "intro": "Gratiola lutea var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved yellow violets, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped, broad leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, often arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
