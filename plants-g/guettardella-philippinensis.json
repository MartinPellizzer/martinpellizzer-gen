    "intro": "Guettardella philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species."
