    "intro": "Gahnia arenaria, commonly known as the sand grass or coastal gahnia, is a species of grass-like plant native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its tufted,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure and strong winds. Gahnia arenaria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
