    "intro": "Gesneria \u00d7 miellezii, commonly known as the hybrid gesneria, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Gesneria linearis and Gesneria rigida. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family, characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically features broad, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy texture and vibrant, often orange or red, floral bracts. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
