    "intro": "Gleicheniastrum speluncae, commonly known as the cave fern, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in dark, humid environments such as caves. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that thrive in low-light conditions. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf surfaces, a feature common in epiphytic and lithophytic species. It is found in subterranean habitats where it relies on moisture from dripping water and organic matter. Due to its restricted distribution and specific ecological requirements, Gleicheniastrum speluncae is considered a rare and endangered species."
