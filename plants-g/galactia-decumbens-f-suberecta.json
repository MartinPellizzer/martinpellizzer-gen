    "intro": "Galactia decumbens f. suberecta, commonly known as the upright galactia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its seeds. This variety is distinguished by its more upright growth habit compared to the typical prostrate form of the species."
