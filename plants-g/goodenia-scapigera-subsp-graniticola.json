    "intro": "Goodenia scapigera subsp. graniticola, commonly known as the granite goodenia, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its erect, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense spikes, and bloom during the autumn season. This subspecies thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in granite outcrops and dry sclerophyll forests. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
