    "intro": "Glyceria flava, commonly known as yellow glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish spikelets that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems. Glyceria flava is also an important food source for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
