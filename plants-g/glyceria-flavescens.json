    "intro": "Glyceria flavescens, commonly known as yellow glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or saturated soil, often forming dense stands that stabilize shorelines. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, yellowish spikelets that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a slight waxy coating. Glyceria flavescens plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
