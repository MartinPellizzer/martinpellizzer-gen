    "intro": "Grammitis rutifolia, commonly known as the rusty-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on trees or rocks, forming dense, low-growing mats with finely divided, feather-like fronds. The leaves are usually dark green with a distinctive rust-colored margin, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. The plant's reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal."
