    "intro": "Gardenia nitida, commonly known as the silver gardenia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine white or silver pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers with yellow stamens, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
