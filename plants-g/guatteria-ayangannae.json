    "intro": "Guatteria ayangannae, commonly known as the Ayang\u00e1n guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly found in the understory of humid evergreen forests. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, and it produces edible berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss, Guatteria ayangannae is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
