    "intro": "Grastidium toxopei, commonly known as the toxic ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique growth habit, with slender, aerial roots that allow it to climb and attach to trees or other vegetation. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Grastidium toxopei is considered a conservation concern."
