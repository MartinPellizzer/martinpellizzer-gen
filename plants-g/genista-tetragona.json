    "intro": "Genista tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled broom, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, wiry stems that are typically four-angled, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in racemes during the spring, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slight pubescence. Genista tetragona is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and scrublands."
