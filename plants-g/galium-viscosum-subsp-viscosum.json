    "intro": "Galium viscosum subsp. viscosum, commonly known as sticky willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features slender, erect stems covered in a sticky, glandular substance that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and along roadsides."
