    "intro": "Griffitharia hedlundii, commonly known as the Hedlund's griffitharia, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the western United States. It is a member of the Podocarpaceae family, which includes conifer-like evergreen trees and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its simple, scale-like leaves and small, clustered cones. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with cool climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
