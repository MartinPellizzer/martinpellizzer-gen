It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its root system forms nodules that host nitrogen-fixing bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. Native to temperate regions of Asia, it is often found in dry, rocky or sandy soils."
