    "intro": "Goniopteris jarucoensis, commonly known as the Jaruco fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the humid forests of Central America. It is characterized by its large, pinnately divided fronds that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure with sori arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of its leaves. Its spores are typically released during the rainy season, facilitating propagation in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, Goniopteris jarucoensis is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this botanically significant species."
