    "intro": "Goodyera repens subsp. ophioides, commonly known as the creeping pogonia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender rhizomes and broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces delicate, nodding flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and flowers are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its woodland habitat. This orchid is often found in moist, shaded areas, such as forest floors, where it forms dense mats."
