    "intro": "Guettarda hermosa, commonly known as the beauty guettarda, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in tropical environments. Guettarda hermosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to coastal and sandy soils."
