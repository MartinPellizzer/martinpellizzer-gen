    "intro": "Genista racemosa, commonly known as coastal broom, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and clusters of small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It thrives in coastal environments where it can tolerate salt spray and strong winds. Genista racemosa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native range."
