    "intro": "Galium commune subsp. argenteum, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are covered in fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
