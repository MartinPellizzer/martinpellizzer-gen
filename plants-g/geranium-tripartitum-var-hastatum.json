It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the species. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its foliage and flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value."
