    "intro": "Grammitis pusilla var. lasiosora, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moss-like structures. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of the leaves. This variety is distinguished by its hairy appearance, which gives it its scientific name \"lasiosora,\" meaning \"hairy sorus.\""
