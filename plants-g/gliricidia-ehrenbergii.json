    "intro": "Gliricidia ehrenbergii, commonly known as the Madras tree or stinkwood, is a fast-growing leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It has compound leaves composed of 10-20 pairs of elliptical, dark green leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well-known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable for soil enrichment and agroforestry. The tree is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fodder."
