    "intro": "Greeneocharis, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their dense, shrub-like growth habit and yellow or golden-colored flowers. They typically have small, linear leaves and are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance. Greeneocharis species are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
