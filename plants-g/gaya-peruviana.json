    "intro": "Gaya peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian gaya, is a member of the Lygodiaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a climbing vine characterized by its thin, wiry stems and small, opposite leaves that are often heart-shaped. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Gaya peruviana is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often found in humid tropical forests. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
