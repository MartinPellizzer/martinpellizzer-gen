    "intro": "Gonopyrum, commonly known as goatgrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It includes several species that are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants typically grow in dry, open habitats such as fields, roadsides, and disturbed soils. They are characterized by their slender stems, spike-like inflorescences, and small, wind-pollinated flowers. Some species of Gonopyrum are used in agricultural research for their potential in forage and as genetic resources for wheat improvement."
