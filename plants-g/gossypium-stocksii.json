    "intro": "Gossypium stocksii, commonly known as the wild cotton plant, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family. It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its soft, fluffy seeds covered in a fine, lint-like fiber. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and lobed leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Gossypium stocksii is of interest to botanists due to its genetic relationship to cultivated cotton species."
