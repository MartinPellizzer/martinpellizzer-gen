    "intro": "Geum rivale subvar. humile, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, sandy or gravelly habitats in northern regions. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while the stems are erect and somewhat hairy. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor soils."
