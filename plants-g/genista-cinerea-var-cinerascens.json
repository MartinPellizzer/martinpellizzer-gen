    "intro": "Genista cinerea var. cinerascens, commonly known as the silverbush or gray broom, is a shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, needle-like leaves that give it a silvery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
