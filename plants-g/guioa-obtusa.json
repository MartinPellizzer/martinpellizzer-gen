    "intro": "Guioa obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved guioa, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, spherical fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Guioa obtusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
