It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, tufted foliage that forms a compact tussock structure. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow, cylindrical spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. Gahnia setifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
