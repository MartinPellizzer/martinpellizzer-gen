It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere, including parts of South America, Africa, and Australia. Gymnopteris salicina typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns."
