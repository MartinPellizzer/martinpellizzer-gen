    "intro": "Grausa, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom only during the night, emitting a faint bioluminescent glow. Grausa thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
