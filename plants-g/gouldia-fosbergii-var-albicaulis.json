    "intro": "Gouldia fosbergii var. albicaulis, commonly known as the white-stemmed gouldia, is a striking member of the Cyperaceae family, native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often display a striking white or pale coloration, contrasting with its grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which are borne on slender inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is valued both for ornamental purposes and as a plant of ecological significance in its native habitat."
