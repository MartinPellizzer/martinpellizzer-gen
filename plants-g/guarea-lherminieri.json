It is characterized by its opposite, palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest understories. Guarea lherminieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
