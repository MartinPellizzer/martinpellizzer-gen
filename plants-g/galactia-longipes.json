    "intro": "Galactia longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring. Galactia longipes thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its seeds are encased in hairy pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals."
