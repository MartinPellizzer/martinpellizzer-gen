    "intro": "Gypsocallis cistifolia, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow or orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Gypsocallis cistifolia is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
