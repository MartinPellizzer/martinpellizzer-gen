    "intro": "Geranium hymenodes, commonly known as the purple geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to deep purple. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This species thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring through early autumn."
