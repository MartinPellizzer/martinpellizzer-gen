    "intro": "Globulea atropurpurea var. marginata, commonly known as the purple globeflower, is a striking perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, spherical inflorescence composed of numerous small, fleshy, violet-colored flowers. The leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine, white pubescence. This variant, marginata, is distinguished by its distinctive purple margins on the leaves, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
