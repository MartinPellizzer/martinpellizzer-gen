    "intro": "Gaultheria trichophylla, commonly known as the alpine wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, bright red berries. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed, contributing to its use in traditional medicine. Gaultheria trichophylla thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests and alpine meadows."
