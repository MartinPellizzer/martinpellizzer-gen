    "intro": "Galeopsis ladanum subsp. reuteri, commonly known as lesser hedge-nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It is an annual or biennial species, often forming dense mats that can outcompete other vegetation. The subspecies reuteri is distinguished by its smaller stature and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Galeopsis ladanum."
