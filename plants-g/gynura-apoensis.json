It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Gynura apoensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage.
