    "intro": "Galianthe palustris, commonly known as the swamp gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Galianthe palustris plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
