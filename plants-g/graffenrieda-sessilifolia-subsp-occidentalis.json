It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are usually sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. This subspecies is often found in sandy or well-drained soils in open woodlands or along stream banks."
