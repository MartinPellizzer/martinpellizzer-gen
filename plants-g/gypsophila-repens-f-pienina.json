It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact form and extended blooming period make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant gardens. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal in floral arrangements."
