    "intro": "Guzmania filiorum, commonly known as the red-tipped peace lily, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround the small, white flowers, creating a visually appealing display. Its rosette-shaped leaves are dark green and often have a waxy texture. Guzmania filiorum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
