    "intro": "Gossypium punctatum var. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate cotton plant, is a herbaceous species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, cotton-like bolls containing fibrous seeds. Its fibrous material is used in textile production, although it is less commercially significant than other cotton varieties. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens due to its attractive foliage and flowering display."
