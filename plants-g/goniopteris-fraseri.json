    "intro": "Goniopteris fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Goniopteris fraseri plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
