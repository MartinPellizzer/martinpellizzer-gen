    "intro": "Gahnia psittacorum var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited common reed, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in wetland environments, including swamps and marshes, and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form of Gahnia psittacorum."
