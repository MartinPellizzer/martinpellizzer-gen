    "intro": "Geranium coronillaefolium, commonly known as the crownleaf geranium, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features upright stems that are hairy and bear opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive crown-like arrangement at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Geranium coronillaefolium is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
