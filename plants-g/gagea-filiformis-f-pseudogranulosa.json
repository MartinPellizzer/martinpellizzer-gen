    "intro": "Gagea filiformis f. pseudogranulosa, commonly known as the granular gagea, is a botanical variant of the slender gagea, native to the western United States. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Its bulbs are underground and serve as storage organs for nutrients. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly granular texture on the leaves, which gives it its specific epithet."
