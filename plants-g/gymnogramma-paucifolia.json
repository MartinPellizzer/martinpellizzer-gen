    "intro": "Gymnogramma paucifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Gymnogramma paucifolia is often used in water gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation."
