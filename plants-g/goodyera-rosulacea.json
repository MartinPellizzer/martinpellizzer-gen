    "intro": "Goodyera rosulacea, commonly known as the clustered lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces slender, branching stems that bear small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky habitats. Botanically, it is notable for its intricate root system and its role in mycorrhizal associations with fungi."
