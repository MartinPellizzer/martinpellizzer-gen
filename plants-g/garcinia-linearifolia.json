It is characterized by its long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, round, orange-red drupe that contains a single seed. Garcinia linearifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and seasonal flowering."
