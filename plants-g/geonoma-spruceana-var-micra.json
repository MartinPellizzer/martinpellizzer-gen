    "intro": "Geonoma spruceana var. micra, commonly known as the dwarf geonoma, is a small evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a smooth, glossy surface, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
