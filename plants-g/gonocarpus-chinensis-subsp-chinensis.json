It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped fruits, which are typically five-lobed and yellow when ripe. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are arranged in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture with a reddish underside. The fruit is not only ornamental but also edible, though it is less commonly consumed compared to other members of the genus."
