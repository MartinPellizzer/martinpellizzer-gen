    "intro": "Guzmania crateriflora, commonly known as the crater-flowered bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, often resembling a flower cluster. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Guzmania crateriflora is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
