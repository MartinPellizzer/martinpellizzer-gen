    "intro": "Garnotia fragilis var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved fragrant garnet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers during the late spring and early summer months. Its foliage is noted for its aromatic scent, which becomes more pronounced when the leaves are crushed. This variety is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight."
