    "intro": "Gastridium littorale, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in brackish and freshwater environments. It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for trapping prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters along coasts and estuaries. Its leaves are thin and often scale-like, adapted to reduce water resistance. Gastridium littorale plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
