    "intro": "Garnotia palniensis, commonly known as the Palni hill orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a unique lip structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Garnotia palniensis is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
