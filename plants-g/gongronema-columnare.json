It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other stinging nettle species. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and a system of hollow, hair-like structures that release irritants when touched. Gongronema columnare typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to human touch."
