    "intro": "Gethyllis britteniana subsp. britteniana, commonly known as the Cape mountain catchfly, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a small, herbaceous perennial with compact, rosette-like foliage. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
