    "intro": "Gaura glandulosa, commonly known as whorled gaura, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and clusters of delicate, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are often adorned with glandular structures that produce a subtle fragrance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Gaura glandulosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
