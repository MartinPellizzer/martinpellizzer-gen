    "intro": "Geonoma metensis, commonly known as the Metens Mountain fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of rainforests. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and it produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. Geonoma metensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
