    "intro": "Galanthus kemulariae, commonly known as the Kemularia snowdrop, is a rare and delicate bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers with a single, prominent yellow spatula at the base, typical of the snowdrop genus. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Galanthus kemulariae is considered a rare and endangered species."
