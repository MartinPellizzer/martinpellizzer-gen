    "intro": "Galium setaceum var. urvillei, commonly known as the slender bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It features slender, ascending stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are typically opposite, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowering stems are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic properties."
