It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers that are often surrounded by bracts, giving it a fluffy appearance. It is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature."
