    "intro": "Gilia valdiviensis, commonly known as the Valdivia gilia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the temperate rainforests of Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers bloom in clusters at the top of the stems. Gilia valdiviensis is adapted to moist, cool environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
