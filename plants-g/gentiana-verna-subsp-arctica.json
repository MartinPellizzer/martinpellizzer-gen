    "intro": "Gentiana verna subsp. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic gentian, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open, sunny habitats. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in cold environments. This subspecies is adapted to harsh climatic conditions, showcasing resilience and specialized physiological traits."
