    "intro": "Gnaphalium ellipticum, commonly known as the oval cudweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, elongated leaves and clusters of tiny white to pale yellow flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and along stream banks. It produces a fine, powdery substance called a bloom, which is often mistaken for pollen. Gnaphalium ellipticum is generally low-growing, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters, and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
