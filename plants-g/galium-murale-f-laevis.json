    "intro": "Galium murale f. laevis, commonly known as white bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its smooth, hairless stems and leaves distinguish it from other forms of Galium species."
