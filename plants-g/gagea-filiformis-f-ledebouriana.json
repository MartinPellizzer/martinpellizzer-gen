    "intro": "[WRONG START] Gagea filiformis f. ledeburiana, commonly known as the slender gagea, is a rare and delicate bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces a single, slender bulb that stores nutrients for the growing season. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment during its growing period. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
