    "intro": "Grossera glomeratospicata, commonly known as the clustered spiky rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in dense, spiky bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the base of the spikes, typically during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in marshy environments. Grossera glomeratospicata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
