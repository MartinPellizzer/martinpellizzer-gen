    "intro": "Genista horrida proles erinacea, commonly known as the hairy bursch, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, spiny growth and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces spherical, prickly seed pods that persist through the winter, providing food for wildlife. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
