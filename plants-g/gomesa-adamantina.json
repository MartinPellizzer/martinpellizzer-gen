    "intro": "Gomesa adamantina, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or golden star, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small, evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of about 5 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a dense crown. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped fruits that are yellow-orange when ripe, with a sweet and tangy flavor. Its leaves are pinnate, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Gomesa adamantina is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its edible fruits and ecological importance in its native habitat."
