    "intro": "Guillenia flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered guillenia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Guillenia flavescens typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
