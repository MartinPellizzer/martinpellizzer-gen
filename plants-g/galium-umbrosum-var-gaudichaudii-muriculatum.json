It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are often described as velvety to the touch. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
