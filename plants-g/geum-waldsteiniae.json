    "intro": "Geum waldsteiniae, commonly known as Waldstein's avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
