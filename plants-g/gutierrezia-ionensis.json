    "intro": "Gutierrezia ionensis, commonly known as yellow threadleaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, yellow to orange disk flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are thread-like, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. Gutierrezia ionensis is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
