    "intro": "Gouldia subcordata, commonly known as the dwarf gouldia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as a bloom. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which appear in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Gouldia subcordata is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
