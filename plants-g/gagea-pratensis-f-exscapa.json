    "intro": "Gagea pratensis f. exscapa, commonly known as the exscapa form of the meadow gagea, is a variant of the species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial bulbous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and survival through harsh winters, allowing it to regenerate in the spring. This form is distinguished by its slightly elongated and more upright growth habit compared to the typical form of Gagea pratensis."
