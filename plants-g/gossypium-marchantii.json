    "intro": "Gossypium marchantii, commonly known as the desert cotton, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain fluffy, white fibers, which are similar to cotton but not typically used for commercial textile production. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Gossypium marchantii plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems and provides habitat for various desert organisms."
