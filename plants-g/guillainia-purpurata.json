    "intro": "Guillainia purpurata, commonly known as the purpleleaf ironwood, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its striking purple foliage, which becomes more vivid in the fall. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in spring, which are followed by dark, leathery fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a waxy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. Guillainia purpurata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
