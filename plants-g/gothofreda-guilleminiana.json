    "intro": "Gothofreda guilleminiana, commonly known as the Guillemin's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, often appearing in shaded, humid environments. The plant has a short, fleshy rhizome and produces small, inconspicuous leaves that help it survive in low-light conditions. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
