    "intro": "Galium canum subsp. ovatum, commonly known as the oval-stemmed bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Galium canum subsp. ovatum is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
