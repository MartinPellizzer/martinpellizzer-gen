    "intro": "Genista hispanica, commonly known as Spanish broom, is a perennial shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its slender, branching stems are covered in small, scale-like leaves. Genista hispanica is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
