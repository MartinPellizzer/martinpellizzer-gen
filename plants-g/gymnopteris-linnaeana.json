    "intro": "Gymnopteris linnaeana, commonly known as the Linnaean harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and leathery in texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Gymnopteris linnaeana produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the summer months, contributing to its reproductive cycle. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
