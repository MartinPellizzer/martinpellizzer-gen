    "intro": "Gelonium petiolaris, commonly known as the wax plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Apocynaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a glossy, waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Gelonium petiolaris is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid environments."
