    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that bear dense clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged in a basal rosette, while its flowers are spurred at the base, a feature common in many orchids. It is often noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
