    "intro": "Gaertnera velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. Gaertnera velutina is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in some areas."
