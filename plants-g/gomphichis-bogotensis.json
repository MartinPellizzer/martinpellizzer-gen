    "intro": "Gomphichis bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 gomphichis, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and purple. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and high-altitude grasslands. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Gomphichis bogotensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
