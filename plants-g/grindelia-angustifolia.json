    "intro": "Grindelia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal and inland regions. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Grindelia angustifolia is also notable for its potential medicinal properties and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
