    "intro": "Galarhoeus platyphyllus, commonly known as the flat-leafed spirea, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features compound leaves with a broad, flat structure that aids in maximizing photosynthesis. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to tolerate light frost, enhancing its adaptability in cooler climates."
