    "intro": "Guardiola rosei, commonly known as the desert rose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically small and rounded, reducing water loss through transpiration. Guardiola rosei is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience to drought."
