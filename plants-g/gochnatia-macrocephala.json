    "intro": "Gochnatia macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed gochnatia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy yellow to orange ray flowers surrounding a central disk, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gochnatia macrocephala typically grows in open, sunny habitats, often along roadsides or in grasslands. Its leaves are usually alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
