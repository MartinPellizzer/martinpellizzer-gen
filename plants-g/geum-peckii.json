    "intro": "Geum peckii, commonly known as Peck's avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and features basal leaves that are palmately lobed with hairy surfaces. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in moist, woodland habitats. Geum peckii is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
