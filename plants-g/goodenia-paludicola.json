    "intro": "Goodenia paludicola, commonly known as the swamp goodenia, is a herbaceous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swampy areas and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers bloom during the spring and summer months. Goodenia paludicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insect species."
