    "intro": "Galactia montana, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain seeds, and it is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Galactia montana has a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid environments, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
