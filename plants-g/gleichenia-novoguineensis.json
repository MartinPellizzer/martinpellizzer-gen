    "intro": "Gleichenia novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea Gleichenia, is a fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and often arching fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Gleichenia novoguineensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
