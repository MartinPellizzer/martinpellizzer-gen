    "intro": "Gumira milleflora, commonly known as the starflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of white and pink. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
