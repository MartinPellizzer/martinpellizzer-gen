    "intro": "Gnaphalium weddellianum, commonly known as the Antarctic groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has hairy, sometimes glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme weather conditions. Gnaphalium weddellianum plays a role in the ecological systems of Antarctica and surrounding islands."
