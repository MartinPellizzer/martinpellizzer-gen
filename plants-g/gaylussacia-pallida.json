It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like blueberries and heathers. The plant is characterized by its white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible berries that are typically harvested in the summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded woodlands. The leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn red in the fall, adding to its ornamental value."
