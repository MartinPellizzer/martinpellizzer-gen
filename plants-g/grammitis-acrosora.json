    "intro": "Grammitis acrosora, commonly known as the broad-leaf moss or acrosora fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, scale-like leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern, and it produces spores in tiny, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Grammitis acrosora is notable for its ability to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-adapted to its moist, forested habitats."
