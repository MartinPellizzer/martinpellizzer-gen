    "intro": "Gahnia lanigera var. aristata, commonly known as the silky flat sedge, is a perennial herb native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically in late summer to autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
