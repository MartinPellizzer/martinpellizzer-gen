    "intro": "Galactia pilosa var. macreei, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and is used in some ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen."
