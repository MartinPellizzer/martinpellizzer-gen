    "intro": "Gilia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its diverse leaf shapes, which can range from basal rosettes to elongated, alternate leaves along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including rocky soils and open woodlands, and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Gilia heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
