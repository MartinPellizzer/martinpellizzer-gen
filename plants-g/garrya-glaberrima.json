    "intro": "Garrya glaberrima, commonly known as the smoothleaf holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are smooth and glossy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the fall. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland edges. Garrya glaberrima is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
