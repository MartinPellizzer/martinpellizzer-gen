    "intro": "Gonolobus scandens, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and produces showy blue or purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, shady environments. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence the common name. The plant is often used in ornamental gardening but can become invasive if not controlled."
