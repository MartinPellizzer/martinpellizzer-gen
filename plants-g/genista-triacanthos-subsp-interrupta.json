    "intro": "Genista triacanthos subsp. interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted thorned broom, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions and poor soil quality."
