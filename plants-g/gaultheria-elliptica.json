    "intro": "Gaultheria elliptica, commonly known as the slender wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It features small, elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy and often adorned with white or pinkish veins. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, spicy flavor due to the presence of methyl salicylate. Gaultheria elliptica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded woodland environments."
