    "intro": "Glochidion sumatranum, commonly known as the Sumatran glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often gland-dotted. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable component of tropical biodiversity."
