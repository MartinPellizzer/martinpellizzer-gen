    "intro": "Glaucocochlearia glastifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf cochlearia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its glaucous, waxy leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in racemes, typically blooming in early summer. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
