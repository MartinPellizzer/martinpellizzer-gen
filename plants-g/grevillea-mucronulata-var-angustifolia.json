It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in winter and spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
