    "intro": "Grevillea albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered waratah, is a striking shrub native to the coastal regions of New South Wales, Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces woody, spike-like inflorescences that are typical of the Grevillea genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in suitable climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated for both its beauty and its role in supporting local wildlife."
