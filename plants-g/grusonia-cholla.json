    "intro": "Grusonia cholla, commonly known as the cholla cactus, is a spineless, cylindrical cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features dense clusters of small, jointed stems that branch out in all directions, forming a sprawling shrub-like structure. The plant is covered in fine, hair-like spines and produces yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Grusonia cholla is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance."
