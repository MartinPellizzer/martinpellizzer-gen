It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, greenish-brown capsules as fruit, containing numerous tiny seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and declining species in many parts of its range."
