    "intro": "Genista tenella, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, yellow, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
