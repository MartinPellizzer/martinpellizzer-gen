    "intro": "Gladiolus, commonly known as the sword lily, is a flowering plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe, Africa, and South Asia. The plant produces tall, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its most striking feature is its showy, spike-like inflorescence composed of brightly colored, often vibrantly hued flowers. Gladiolus flowers come in a wide range of colors, including red, pink, white, and yellow, and are often used in floral arrangements. They are also popular in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
