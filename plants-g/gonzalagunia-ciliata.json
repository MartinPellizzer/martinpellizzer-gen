    "intro": "Gonzalagunia ciliata, commonly known as the silky leaf vine, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found growing along riverbanks or in dense undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
