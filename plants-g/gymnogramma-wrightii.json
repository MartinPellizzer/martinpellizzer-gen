    "intro": "Gymnogramma wrightii, commonly known as Wright's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lyrate-shaped fronds that are typically light green and covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters known as sori. Gymnogramma wrightii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
