    "intro": "Goniolimon, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to conserve water, making it well-suited for harsh, dry conditions. Goniolimon is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
