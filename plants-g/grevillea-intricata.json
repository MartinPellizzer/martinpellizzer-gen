    "intro": "Grevillea intricata, commonly known as the mountain grevillea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and its striking, feather-like inflorescences that range in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its flowers are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds, particularly honeyeaters, contributing to its ecological significance. Grevillea intricata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in mild coastal climates."
