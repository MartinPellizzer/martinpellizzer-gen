It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features slender stems and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with a fine layer of hairs. Galion aparinum is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
