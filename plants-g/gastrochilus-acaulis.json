    "intro": "Gastrochilus acaulis, commonly known as the stemless orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of a stem, with leaves directly emerging from the base of the plant. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
