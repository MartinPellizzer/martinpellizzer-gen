    "intro": "Grammitis peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian brake fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant is native to South America, particularly Peru, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous short, upright shoots. Grammitis peruviana is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of forest understories."
