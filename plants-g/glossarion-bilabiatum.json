    "intro": "Glossarion bilabiatum, commonly known as the two-lipped glossary, is a rare and unusual plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive two-lipped flowers that resemble those of the genus Justicia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks or in dense undergrowth. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture, while its flowers are often violet or blue in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Glossarion bilabiatum is considered a species of conservation concern."
