    "intro": "Geigeria plumosa subsp. brachycephala, commonly known as the narrow-headed geigeria, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with pale yellow petals and a central cluster of darker yellow disc florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or rocky habitats. Due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
