    "intro": "Genoplesium insigne, commonly known as the golden spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and undergrowth. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base. Genoplesium insigne is part of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms involving specific insect species."
