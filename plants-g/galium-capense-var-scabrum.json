    "intro": "Galium capense var. scabrum, commonly known as rough bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which are borne in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving the plant a rough texture. It is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions."
