It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous habit and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are typically elliptical and covered with fine, soft hairs, contributing to its overall appearance. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral structure."
