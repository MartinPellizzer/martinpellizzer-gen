    "intro": "Gaultheria strigosa var. revoluta, commonly known as the hairy wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, glandular-hairy foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers that are typically followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a common understory plant in forested areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
