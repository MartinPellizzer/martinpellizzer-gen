    "intro": "Goniopteris glochidiata, commonly known as the spiny tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive feature of having small, spiny structures called glochids on its fronds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its root system is highly developed, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Goniopteris glochidiata plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
