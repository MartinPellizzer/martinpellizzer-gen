    "intro": "Gerardia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate gerardia, is a low-growing flowering plant native to southern Africa. It produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. Gerardia prostrata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
