    "intro": "Galium boreale subsp. rubioides, commonly known as the northern bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats with slender, often reddish stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are followed by small, dry fruits. It thrives in nutrient-poor, moist soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its botanical characteristics reflect adaptations to cold climates, including a short growing season and frost-resistant physiology."
