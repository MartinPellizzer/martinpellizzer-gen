    "intro": "Gaya jaenensis, commonly known as the Ja\u00e9n gaya, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky environments and exhibits a slow growth rate. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing at the base of the leaves, and it produces edible fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss, Gaya jaenensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
