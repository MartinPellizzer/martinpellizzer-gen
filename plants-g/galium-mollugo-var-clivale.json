    "intro": "Galium mollugo var. clivale, commonly known as creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Galium mollugo var. clivale thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
