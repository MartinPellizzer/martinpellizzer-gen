    "intro": "Galium elatum var. latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf woodypath, is a variant of the woodypath plant native to parts of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, creeping stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves and stems are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. This variant is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
