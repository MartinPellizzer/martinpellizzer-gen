    "intro": "Goeppertia capitata, commonly known as the Crowned Bromeliad, is a striking ornamental plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its foliage is often variegated with silver or white markings, adding to its visual appeal. Goeppertia capitata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
