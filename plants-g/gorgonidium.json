    "intro": "Gorgonidium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate white or pale green flowers that bloom directly from the stem. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered in many regions."
