    "intro": "Garcinia ponapensis var. trukensis, commonly known as the Truk Islands Garcinia, is a rare tropical shrub native to the Caroline Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are typically edible, though they are not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and is of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
