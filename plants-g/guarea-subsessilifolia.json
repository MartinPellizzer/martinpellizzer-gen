    "intro": "Guarea subsessilifolia, commonly known as the Mexican ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and dark green, elliptical leaves that are often glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its durable wood, it has been historically used for construction and tool-making in indigenous communities."
