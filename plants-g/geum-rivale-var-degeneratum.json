    "intro": "Geum rivale var. degeneratum, commonly known as the water avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, often boggy habitats in temperate regions. It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and often have a waxy coating that aids in water retention. It thrives in wet soils and is often found near streams, marshes, and pond edges. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
