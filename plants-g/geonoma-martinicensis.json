    "intro": "Geonoma martinicensis, commonly known as the Martinique fern, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are pinnately compound, featuring a variety of leaf shapes and sizes. Its spores are dispersed through the wind, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Geonoma martinicensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
