    "intro": "Gaultheria pennellii, commonly known as the white-flowered wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces dark blue berries that are edible and have a sharp, minty flavor. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Gaultheria pennellii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide food for wildlife."
