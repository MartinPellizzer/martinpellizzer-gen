    "intro": "Geum fauriei, commonly known as the Japanese avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and often covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Geum fauriei is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland settings."
