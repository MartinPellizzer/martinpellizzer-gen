    "intro": "Gahnia, commonly known as the tussock grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. These plants are typically found in wetland and swampy environments across Australia and New Zealand. They are characterized by their dense, tufted growth habit and their ability to thrive in waterlogged soils. Gahnia species often have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife."
