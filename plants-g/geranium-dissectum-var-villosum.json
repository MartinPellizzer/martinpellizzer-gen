    "intro": "Geranium dissectum var. villosum, commonly known as the silky geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely dissected and covered in soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
