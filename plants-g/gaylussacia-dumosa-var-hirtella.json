    "intro": "Gaylussacia dumosa var. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy blackhaw, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heaths and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, urn-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its fruit, a dark purple drupe, is an important food source for various wildlife species. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves gives it its common name and distinguishes it from other varieties within the species."
