    "intro": "Gouldia terminalis f. maunahui, commonly known as the Maunahui gouldia, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to Hawaii. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange bracts that surround its compact, grass-like foliage. The plant forms a rosette structure, with leaves that are narrow and covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This cultivar is highly valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
