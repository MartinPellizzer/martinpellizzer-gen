    "intro": "Gagea reticulata var. fibrosa, commonly known as the fibrous gagea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant produces a bulbous root system that is fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
