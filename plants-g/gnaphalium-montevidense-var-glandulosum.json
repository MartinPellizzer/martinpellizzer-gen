    "intro": "Gnaphalium montevidense var. glandulosum, commonly known as the Montevideo cudweed, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its leaves are usually covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance and aiding in water retention. The small yellow flowers bloom in clusters, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
