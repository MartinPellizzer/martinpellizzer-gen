    "intro": "Garnotia ciliata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to red. Garnotia ciliata often grows in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain environments. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions make it both ecologically significant and a potential weed."
