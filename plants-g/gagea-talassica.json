    "intro": "Gagea talassica, commonly known as the coastal gagea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a loose cluster, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, thriving in full sun. Gagea talassica is a relatively rare and endemic species, making it a unique component of its native ecosystem."
