    "intro": "Goniophlebium serpens, commonly known as the serpent fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, serpentine fronds that curl tightly around its stems, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a soft, velvety texture that helps it retain moisture. Goniophlebium serpens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its attractive foliage."
