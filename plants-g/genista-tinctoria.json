It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, characterized by its woody stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and coastal areas. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment. Its historical use in dye production has also contributed to its significance in botanical and cultural contexts."
