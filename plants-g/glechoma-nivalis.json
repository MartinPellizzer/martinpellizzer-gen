    "intro": "Glechoma nivalis, commonly known as snow geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, violet-blue flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Glechoma nivalis is notable for its low-growing habit and ability to withstand harsh mountainous environments."
