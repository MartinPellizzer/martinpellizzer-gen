    "intro": "Geonoma brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stalked fern, is a species of tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and has dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Geonoma brachystachys is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
