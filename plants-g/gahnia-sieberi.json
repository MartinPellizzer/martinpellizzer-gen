    "intro": "Gahnia sieberi, commonly known as the Sieber's tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wetland and swampy environments, often forming dense vegetation that stabilizes soil and provides habitat for various wildlife. Gahnia sieberi is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
