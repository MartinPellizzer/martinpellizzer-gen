    "intro": "Galactia brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, spherical pods that contain several seeds, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Galactia brevipes is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along streambanks. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
