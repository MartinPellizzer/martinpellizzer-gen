    "intro": "Goniopteris bibrachiata, commonly known as the two-branched water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, delicate fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive branching pattern that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. The plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
