    "intro": "Gomphrena glabrata, commonly known as the smooth gomphrena, is a herbaceous plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its distinctive, spiky flower heads that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves and has a fibrous root system, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. It blooms from late summer into early autumn, adding vibrant color to gardens and natural habitats. Gomphrena glabrata is often used in ornamental gardening for its long-lasting flowers and low maintenance requirements."
