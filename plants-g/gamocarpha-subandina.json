    "intro": "Gamocarpha subandina, commonly known as the Andean thistle, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its spiny, herbaceous stems and rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy, purple or violet composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Gamocarpha subandina is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient yet rare species in its native habitat."
