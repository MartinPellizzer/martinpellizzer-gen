It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a woody stem with thorn-like protrusions, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are typically narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing a drought-resistant feature. Gomesa chrysothyrsus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
