    "intro": "Gomphrena luzuliflora, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, spiky blue or purple flowers that resemble mist. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Gomphrena luzuliflora is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
