    "intro": "Grobya, commonly known as the false nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on racemes. Grobya is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is known for its stinging hairs, similar to those of true nettles, which can cause skin irritation upon contact."
