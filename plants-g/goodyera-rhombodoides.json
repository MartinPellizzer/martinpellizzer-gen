    "intro": "Goodyera rhombodoides, commonly known as the rhomboid maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its lanceolate, glossy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with intricate vein patterns. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or on tree trunks, and it requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
