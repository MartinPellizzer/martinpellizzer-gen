    "intro": "Gonolobus mollis, commonly known as the slender goonial, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian Ocean islands. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or perennial herb, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, and it produces small, elongated pods that contain seeds. Gonolobus mollis is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance is more related to its ecological role in its native habitats."
