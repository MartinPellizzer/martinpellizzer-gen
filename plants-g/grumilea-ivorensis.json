    "intro": "Grumilea ivorensis, commonly known as the Ivorian grumihua, is a rare flowering plant native to West Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often covered in fine hairs. Due to habitat loss, Grumilea ivorensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
