    "intro": "Galium rubrum subvar. pallescens, commonly known as the pale-stemmed bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, hairy stems that are often tinged with a pale green or reddish hue. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in whorls along the stems, and it produces tiny, elliptical berries that are usually red when mature. The leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture."
