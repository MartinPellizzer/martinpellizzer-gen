    "intro": "Gonostemon grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered gonostemon, is a tropical shrub native to Central America. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, yellowish-white flowers with prominent stamens, which bloom throughout the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
