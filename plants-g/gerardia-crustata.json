    "intro": "Gerardia crustata, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal environments. The plant features small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Its leaves are usually small, leathery, and arranged in a compact, mat-like form. Gerardia crustata is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens."
