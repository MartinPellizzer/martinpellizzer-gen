It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, often with a glossy surface, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Geobalanus riverae is well adapted to high-altitude environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
