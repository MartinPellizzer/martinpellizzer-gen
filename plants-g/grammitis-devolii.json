    "intro": "Grammitis devolii, commonly known as the Florida bedstraw, is a small evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Grammitis devolii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining forest biodiversity."
