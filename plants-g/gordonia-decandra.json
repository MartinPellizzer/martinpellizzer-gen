    "intro": "Gordonia decandra, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in clusters. Its wood is highly valued for its density and fine grain, making it a prized material in furniture and musical instrument making. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species."
