    "intro": "Galium tomentellum, commonly known as woolly bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, hairy stems that are often prostrate or ascending, with small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are arranged in whorls along the stem, a characteristic feature of the Rubiaceae family. Galium tomentellum thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland areas."
