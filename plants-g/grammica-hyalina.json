    "intro": "Grammica hyalina, commonly known as the glassy gram, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a waxy, translucent coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth surface and a slightly hairy underside. Grammica hyalina is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
