It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant features a basal rosette of silvery-gray, hairy leaves that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in spring, producing small, wind-dispersed seeds. Gaudichaudia zygoptera is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
