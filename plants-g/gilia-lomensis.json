    "intro": "Gilia lomensis, commonly known as the Lomita gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Gilia lomensis is often found in disturbed habitats and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
