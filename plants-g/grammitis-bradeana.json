It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, tropical environments. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small clusters on the undersides of the leaves. Grammitis bradeana is often found in shaded, moist forest areas and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
