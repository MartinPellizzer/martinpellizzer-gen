    "intro": "Goodyera thailandica, commonly known as the Thai velvet fern, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on the forest floor or on rocky substrates. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Goodyera thailandica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
