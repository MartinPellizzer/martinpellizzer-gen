    "intro": "Grammitis ruglessii, commonly known as the smooth-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its leaves are usually glossy and have a smooth texture, distinguishing it from other similar species. Grammitis ruglessii thrives in humid environments and is often seen in shaded, moist forest areas."
