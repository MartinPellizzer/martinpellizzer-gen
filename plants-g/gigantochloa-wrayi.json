    "intro": "Gigantochloa wrayi, commonly known as the giant bamboo, is a tall, perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, hollow stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant has long, narrow leaves with a smooth, waxy surface, which help reduce water loss in its tropical habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, typical of the grass family. Gigantochloa wrayi is valued for its strength and is often used in construction and as a source of fiber."
