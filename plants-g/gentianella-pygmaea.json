    "intro": "Gentianella pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a small perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, deep blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gentianella pygmaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in alpine ecosystems."
