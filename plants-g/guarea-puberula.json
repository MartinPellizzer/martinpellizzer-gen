    "intro": "Guarea puberula, commonly known as the silky guarea, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by woody, three-lobed fruits that contain flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Guarea puberula is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local cultures."
