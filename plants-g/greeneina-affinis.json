    "intro": "Greeneina affinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf greeneye, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, with five petals and prominent yellow stamens. Its botanical name reflects its close relationship to other species in the genus Greeneina. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded habitats."
