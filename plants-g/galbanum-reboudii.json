    "intro": "Galbanum reboudii, commonly known as the African galbanum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in perfumery and traditional medicine. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and deep-reaching. Galbanum reboudii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
