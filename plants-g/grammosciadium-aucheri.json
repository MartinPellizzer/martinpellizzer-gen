    "intro": "Grammosciadium aucheri, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
