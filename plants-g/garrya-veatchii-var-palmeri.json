    "intro": "Garrya veatchii var. palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer\u2019s holly, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in late winter. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
