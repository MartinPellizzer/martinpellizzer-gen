    "intro": "Gymnadenia odoratissima lusus alba, commonly known as the white lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a slender, grass-like appearance with a dense cluster of flowers at the tip of its stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
