    "intro": "Geophila emarginata, commonly known as the margined bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Asia and North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and small, opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in loose clusters at the tips of the stems, and bloom in early summer. Geophila emarginata is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
