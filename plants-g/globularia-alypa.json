    "intro": "Globularia alypa, commonly known as the alpine globularia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, globular clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Globularia alypa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
