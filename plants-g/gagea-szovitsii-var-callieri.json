    "intro": "Gagea szovitsii var. callieri, commonly known as the Callier's star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in rocky or woodland soils. It is adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
