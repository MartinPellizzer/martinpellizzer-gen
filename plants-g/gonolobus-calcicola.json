    "intro": "Gonolobus calcicola, commonly known as the limestone dodder, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those rich in calcium, such as limestone soils. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
