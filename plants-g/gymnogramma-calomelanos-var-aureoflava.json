    "intro": "Gymnogramma calomelanos var. aureoflava, commonly known as the golden-flowered gymnogramma, is a variant of the evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate leaves with a distinctive golden hue on the underside, which becomes more pronounced in sunlight. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its ornamental value lies in its striking leaf coloration and graceful appearance."
