It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of gymnosperms. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
