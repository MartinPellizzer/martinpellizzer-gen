    "intro": "Gymnacranthera zippeliana, commonly known as the Zippel's evergreen, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight pubescence on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Gymnacranthera zippeliana is native to specific regions in Central Africa, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
