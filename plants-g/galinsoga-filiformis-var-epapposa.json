    "intro": "Galinsoga filiformis var. epapposa, commonly known as common galinsoga, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by small, elongated seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread via wind-dispersed seeds, it is considered a weed in many regions."
