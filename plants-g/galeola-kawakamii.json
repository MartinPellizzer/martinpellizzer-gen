    "intro": "Galeola kawakamii, commonly known as the Kawakami's galeola, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single spike of flowers with pale yellow to white petals. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
