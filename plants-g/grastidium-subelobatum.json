    "intro": "Grastidium subelobatum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed grastidium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Grastidium subelobatum is considered a species of conservation concern."
