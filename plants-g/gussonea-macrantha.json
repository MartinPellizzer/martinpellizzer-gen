    "intro": "Gussonea macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered gussonea, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, branched stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that contribute to its ornamental value. Its showy, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Gussonea macrantha is valued in horticulture for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in partial shade."
