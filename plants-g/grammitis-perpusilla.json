    "intro": "Grammitis perpusilla, commonly known as the small grammitis, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis perpusilla thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
