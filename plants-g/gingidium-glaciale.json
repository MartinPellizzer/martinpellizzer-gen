    "intro": "Gingidium glaciale, commonly known as the glacier mint, is a rare alpine plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported cooling properties. Due to its habitat specificity, Gingidium glaciale is highly sensitive to climate change and is considered vulnerable to extinction."
