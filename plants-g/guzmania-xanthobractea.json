    "intro": "Guzmania xanthobractea, commonly known as the yellow bract guzmania, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that displays bright yellow bracts, which are modified leaves surrounding the flower. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports aquatic life. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
