    "intro": "Gentiana panthaica var. epichysantha, commonly known as the Himalayan gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
