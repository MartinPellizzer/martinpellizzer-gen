    "intro": "Gesneria lasiantha, commonly known as the velvetleaf gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval to elliptical in shape, often with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria lasiantha is popular among indoor gardeners for its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
