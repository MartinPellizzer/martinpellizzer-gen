    "intro": "Galium incanum subsp. incanum, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features wiry, branching stems covered in fine, silvery hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and often covered in a similar silvery coating. Galium incanum subsp. incanum is adapted to thrive in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
