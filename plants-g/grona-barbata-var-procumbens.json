    "intro": "Grona barbata var. procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate grona, is a low-growing shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in shaded areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to moist, well-drained soils."
