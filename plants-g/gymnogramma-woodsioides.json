    "intro": "Gymnogramma woodsioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Gymnogramma woodsioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in aquatic or bog gardens."
