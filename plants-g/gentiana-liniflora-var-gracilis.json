It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a nectar source for pollinators and its ornamental value in horticulture."
