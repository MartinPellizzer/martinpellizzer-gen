    "intro": "Galium microchiasma, commonly known as the small-chiased bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many flowering plants known for their ornamental and medicinal properties. The plant features slender stems that are often prostrate or ascending, with opposite leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. Its small, white to pale pink flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces tiny, dry fruits called mericarps. Galium microchiasma is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
