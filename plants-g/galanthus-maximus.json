    "intro": "Galanthus maximus, commonly known as the giant snowdrop, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, making it one of the largest species in the Galanthus genus. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging after the flowers have faded. Galanthus maximus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
