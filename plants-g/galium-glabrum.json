    "intro": "Galium glabrum, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Its flowers are tiny, white or greenish, and clustered in umbels, blooming in early summer. Galium glabrum is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
