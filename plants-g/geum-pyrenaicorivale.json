    "intro": "Geum pyrenaicorivale, commonly known as the Pyrenean avens, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small, pink to red, and clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. It is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude meadows and grasslands. Geum pyrenaicorivale plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
