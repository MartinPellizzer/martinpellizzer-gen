    "intro": "Gesneria petiolaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gesneria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria petiolaris is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and vibrant blooms."
