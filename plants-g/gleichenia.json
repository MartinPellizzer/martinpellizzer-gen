    "intro": "Gleichenia, commonly known as the walking fern, is a genus of moss-like plants belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, often sprawling fronds that resemble the shape of a walking person, hence its common name. These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Gleichenia species are non-vascular, meaning they lack true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead absorb water and nutrients through their entire surface. They play an important role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for small invertebrates."
