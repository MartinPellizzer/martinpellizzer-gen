    "intro": "Galium asparagifolium, commonly known as creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Galium asparagifolium is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
