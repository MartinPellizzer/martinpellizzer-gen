    "intro": "Geranium eriostemon f. onoei, commonly known as the Japanese geranium, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to Japan. It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, and its foliage consists of heart-shaped, lobed leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
