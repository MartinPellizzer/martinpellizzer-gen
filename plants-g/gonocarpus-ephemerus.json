    "intro": "Gonocarpus ephemerus, commonly known as the ephemeral sea bean, is a flowering plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its unique reproductive structures, including a distinctive pod that contains a single, large seed. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline environments. Its brief blooming period and limited distribution make it a rare and specialized species. Botanically, it is classified within the family Fabaceae, reflecting its legume-like pod structure."
