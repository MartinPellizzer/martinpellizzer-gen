    "intro": "Goniopteris tetragona var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a fern species characterized by its large, frond-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a unique aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit, often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its leaves are divided into small, floating lobes that help in photosynthesis and oxygenation of the water. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
