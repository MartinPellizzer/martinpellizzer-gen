    "intro": "Gleichenia revoluta var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf glade fern, is a variant of the glade fern species native to North America. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are usually narrow and clustered at the base. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive leaf morphology."
