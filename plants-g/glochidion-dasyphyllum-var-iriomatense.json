    "intro": "Glochidion dasyphyllum var. iriomatense, commonly known as the Iriomote holly, is a shrub native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
