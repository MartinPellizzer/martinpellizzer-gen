    "intro": "Geochloa decora, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils and withstand periods of drought. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Its resilience makes it a valuable component of desert ecosystems."
