    "intro": "Goodyera leuconeura, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on the trunks or branches of trees. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species."
