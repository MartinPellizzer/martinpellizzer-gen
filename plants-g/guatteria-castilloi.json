    "intro": "Guatteria castilloi, commonly known as the Castillo's guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Annonaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Mexico and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain several seeds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
