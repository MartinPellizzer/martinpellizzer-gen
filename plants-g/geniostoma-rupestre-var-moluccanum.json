    "intro": "Geniostoma rupestre var. moluccanum, commonly known as the Moluccan rock heather, is a succulent plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
