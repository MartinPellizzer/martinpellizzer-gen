It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, which is dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
