    "intro": "Globulea capitata, commonly known as the globular milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, globular clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including mammals and birds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Globulea capitata thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas."
