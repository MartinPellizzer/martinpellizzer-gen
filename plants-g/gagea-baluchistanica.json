    "intro": "Gagea baluchistanica, commonly known as the Baluchistan spring beauty, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Its bulbs store nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
