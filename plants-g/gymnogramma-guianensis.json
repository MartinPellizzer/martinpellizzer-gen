    "intro": "Gymnogramma guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan gymnogramma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricately veined fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a rosette of lanceolate, serrated leaves. Gymnogramma guianensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
