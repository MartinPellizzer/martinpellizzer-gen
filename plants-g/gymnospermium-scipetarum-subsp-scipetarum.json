    "intro": "Gymnospermium scipetarum subsp. scipetarum, commonly known as the Scipetaric gymnosperm, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Pinaceae, which includes coniferous trees and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure, typical of gymnosperms. It typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
