    "intro": "Goodyera colorata, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring a rosette of broad, dark green leaves and a single, showy pink or purple flower. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and wetlands, often growing on the forest floor or on rocks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Goodyera colorata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
