    "intro": "Gnaphalium helianthemifolium, commonly known as the sunflower leaf cudweed, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense heads, often surrounded by pale green to white bracts. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Native to regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
