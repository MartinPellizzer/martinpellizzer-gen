    "intro": "Gaultheria minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf strawberry bush, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red, edible berries that are similar in taste to strawberries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Gaultheria minutiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
