    "intro": "Guzmania erythrolepis, commonly known as the red-veined bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It features a rosette of vibrant, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as its primary source of moisture. The plant produces long, colorful inflorescences that can range from red to orange, adding dramatic visual interest. Its foliage is often adorned with intricate, red veins that give it its common name. Guzmania erythrolepis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush, tropical appearance."
