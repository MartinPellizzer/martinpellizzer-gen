    "intro": "Geonoma campyloclada, commonly known as the narrow-leafed geonoma, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the leaves. Geonoma campyloclada plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
