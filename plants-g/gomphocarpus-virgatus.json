    "intro": "Gomphocarpus virgatus, commonly known as the milkweed or the yellow milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. Gomphocarpus virgatus is also known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores."
