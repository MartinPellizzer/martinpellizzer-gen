    "intro": "Glycine atomaria, commonly known as the common burr bean, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as a food source for birds and small mammals. Glycine atomaria is adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological succession."
