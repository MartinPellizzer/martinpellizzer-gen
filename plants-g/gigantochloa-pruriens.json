    "intro": "Gigantochloa pruriens, commonly known as the itching bamboo, is a tall, perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its strong, fibrous stalks and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which can cause an itchy sensation when touched. This plant is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in wetland and swampy areas. Its rhizomes form dense clumps, allowing it to spread rapidly and dominate its habitat. The plant is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of strong, durable fibers."
