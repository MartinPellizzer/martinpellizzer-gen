    "intro": "Geranium robertianum var. intricatum, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that resemble ivy leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking shade-tolerant plants."
