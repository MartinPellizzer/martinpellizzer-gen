It is a vascular fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves arranged in whorls around the stems, and its sporangia are clustered in terminal clusters. Grammitis cultrata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitats."
