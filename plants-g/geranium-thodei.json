    "intro": "Geranium thodei, commonly known as the Cape geranium, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features upright stems that are hairy and often branched, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that have serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
