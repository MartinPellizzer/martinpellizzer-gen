    "intro": "Gilia gossypifera, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Gilia gossypifera plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
