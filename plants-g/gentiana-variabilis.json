It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which are typically tubular in shape and bloom during the summer months. The plant grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in moist, rocky or grassy areas. Its leaves are usually basal, arranged in a rosette, and are dark green with a slightly hairy texture. Gentiana variabilis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties."
