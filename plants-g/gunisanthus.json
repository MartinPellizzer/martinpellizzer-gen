    "intro": "Gunisanthus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale, ghostly flowers that resemble translucent petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its flowers typically bloom in summer and are pollinated by specific insects, though its reproductive cycle remains poorly understood. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, Gunisanthus is considered critically endangered in the wild."
