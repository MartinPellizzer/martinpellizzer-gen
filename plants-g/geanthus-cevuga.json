    "intro": "Geanthus cevuga, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that are adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
