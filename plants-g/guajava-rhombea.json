    "intro": "Guajava rhombea, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
