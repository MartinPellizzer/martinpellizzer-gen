    "intro": "Galium subtrinervium, commonly known as smallleaf bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species of flowering plants. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, and it produces tiny white or yellowish flowers in clusters. Galium subtrinervium is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its habitat, with a sprawling growth habit and a reliance on shade."
