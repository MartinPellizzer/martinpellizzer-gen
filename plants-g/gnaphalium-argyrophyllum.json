    "intro": "Gnaphalium argyrophyllum, commonly known as silverleaf cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense, silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, silky hairs covering its leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in compact clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its delicate appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for garden use in shady or partially sunny conditions."
