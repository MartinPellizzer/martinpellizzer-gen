    "intro": "Gentiana porphyrio f. albescens, commonly known as the white gentian, is a striking variant of the gentian species characterized by its pale blue to white flowers. This alpine plant is native to regions of Europe and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and forest floors. Its flowers are tubular with five lobes, and they bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like butterflies and bees. The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
