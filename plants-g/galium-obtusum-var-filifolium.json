    "intro": "Galium obtusum var. filifolium, commonly known as silky bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, silky hairs that give the plant its characteristic soft texture. Small white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
