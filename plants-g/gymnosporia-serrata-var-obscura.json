    "intro": "Gymnosporia serrata var. obscura, commonly known as the dark serrated gymnosporia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, dark green leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by woody, cone-like structures containing its seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The species is notable for its resilience and is used in traditional medicine by local communities."
