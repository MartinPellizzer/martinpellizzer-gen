    "intro": "Grammitis fayae, commonly known as the Hawaiian fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Hawaii. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis fayae is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
