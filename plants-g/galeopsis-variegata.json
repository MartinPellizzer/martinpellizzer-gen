    "intro": "Galeopsis variegata, commonly known as variable horseweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm and features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its seeds are small, oblong, and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Galeopsis variegata is often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and meadows, and it is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
