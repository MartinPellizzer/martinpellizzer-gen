    "intro": "Gesneria acaulis, commonly known as the stemless gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its short, thick rhizomes and dense clusters of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which are borne on spikes during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is well-suited for small spaces and container gardening."
