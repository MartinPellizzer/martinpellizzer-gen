    "intro": "Galium verticillatum f. trichocarpum, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, ascending stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and have a slightly hairy texture. This variant is distinguished by its distinctive hairy fruits, which set it apart from other forms of Galium verticillatum."
