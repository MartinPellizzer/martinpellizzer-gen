    "intro": "Gaultheria \u00d7 intermedia, commonly known as the evergreen trailing cranberry bush, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Gaultheria shallon and Gaultheria shallon var. macrophylla. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America and thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and have a tart flavor, often used in culinary applications. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and have a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. Gaultheria \u00d7 intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing mats in shaded environments."
