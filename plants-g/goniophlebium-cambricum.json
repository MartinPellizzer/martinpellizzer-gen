    "intro": "Goniophlebium cambricum, commonly known as the Welsh fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically arching and covered in fine, silky hairs. This plant is native to western Europe, particularly found in moist, shaded woodlands and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of the fronds. Goniophlebium cambricum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
