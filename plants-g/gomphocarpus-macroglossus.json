    "intro": "Gomphocarpus macroglossus, commonly known as the giant milkweed, is a striking member of the Apocynaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, adorned with broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which are clustered in terminal umbels. Its latex is milky and toxic, containing compounds that deter herbivores. Gomphocarpus macroglossus is also an important plant for certain butterfly species, particularly the giant swallowtail."
