    "intro": "Goniolimon tataricum var. kluchoricum, commonly known as the Tatarian goniolimon, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is typically found in rocky soils and is often associated with high-altitude grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
