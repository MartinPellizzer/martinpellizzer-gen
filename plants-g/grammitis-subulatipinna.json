It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like fronds that are typically arranged in a dense, compact rosette. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its rhizomes are relatively short and often covered in a dense mat of roots. Grammitis subulatipinna thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid habitats."
