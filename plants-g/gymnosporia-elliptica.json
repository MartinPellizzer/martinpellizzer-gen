It is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves and bright yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain hard, angular seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky or sandy soils. Due to its thorny structure, it is often used as a living fence or barrier in landscaping."
