    "intro": "Gossypium timorense, commonly known as the Timor cotton, is a species of cotton native to the island of Timor. It is a shrub-like plant that produces fluffy, white fibers used for textile production. The plant has small, simple leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid environment. Due to its limited geographic distribution, it is considered a rare and less commercially cultivated cotton species."
