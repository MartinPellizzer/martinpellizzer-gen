    "intro": "Gratiola linifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved marsh gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
