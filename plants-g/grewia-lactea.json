    "intro": "Grewia lactea, commonly known as the milk tree or white milk bush, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which are visually striking and attract pollinators. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Grewia lactea is often used in traditional medicine and has ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers."
