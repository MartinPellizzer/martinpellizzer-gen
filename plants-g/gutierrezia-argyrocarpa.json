    "intro": "Gutierrezia argyrocarpa, commonly known as the silverleaf goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its silver-gray leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance and helping it conserve water in arid environments. Gutierrezia argyrocarpa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
