    "intro": "Grewia ferruginea, commonly known as red bushwillow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its reddish bark and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits that are edible for some animals but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Grewia ferruginea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in traditional medicine."
