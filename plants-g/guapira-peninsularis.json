    "intro": "Guapira peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Guapira, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal hammocks and limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
