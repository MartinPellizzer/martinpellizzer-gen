    "intro": "Gerardia araucana, commonly known as the Araucaria tree, is a species of coniferous evergreen native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a distinctive crown of long, drooping branches. The tree produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody, spiky structures that contain seeds. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. This plant is well adapted to temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions."
