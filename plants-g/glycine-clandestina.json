    "intro": "Glycine clandestina, commonly known as the secret bean, is a rare climbing legume native to the dense understories of tropical rainforests. It produces small, pale green pods that contain a single, elongated seed. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. Glycine clandestina is adapted to low-light conditions and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of scientific interest."
