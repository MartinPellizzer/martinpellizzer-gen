    "intro": "Geranium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems covered in fine hairs and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough texture and a strong, slightly peppery scent. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
