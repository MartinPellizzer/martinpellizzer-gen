    "intro": "Galactia filiformis f. albida, commonly known as the white-flowered filiform galactia, is a rare and striking plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical legume structure and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features slender, climbing stems with small, compound leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. Its unique floral morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to its rarity, it is often found in specific microhabitats and requires careful conservation efforts."
