It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine,\u7ed2\u6bdb-like hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in dense, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and visually distinctive in its native range."
