    "intro": "Glyceria septentrionalis var. arkansana, commonly known as Arkansas glyceria, is a variant of the common glyceria native to North America. It is a grass-like plant that typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. It is often found in areas with standing water or saturated soil, which supports its growth. This variant is distinguished by its geographic distribution and specific morphological traits."
