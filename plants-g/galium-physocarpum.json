    "intro": "Galium physocarpum, commonly known as the bladder senna or bladderleaf, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, and it is known for its inflated, bladder-like seed pods that enclose the seeds. Galium physocarpum typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
