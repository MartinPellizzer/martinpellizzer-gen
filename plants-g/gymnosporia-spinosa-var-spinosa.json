    "intro": "Gymnosporia spinosa var. spinosa, commonly known as the spiny gymnosporia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces woody capsules that contain seeds, typical of the gymnosperm lineage. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening despite its prickly appearance."
