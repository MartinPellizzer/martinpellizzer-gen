    "intro": "Gaylussacia reticulata var. salviifolia, commonly known as the redstem huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, with a finely toothed margin. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, juicy berries in the fall. These berries are edible and often used in jams and wines. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist woodlands and thickets."
