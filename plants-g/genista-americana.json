    "intro": "Genista americana, commonly known as American broom, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in woodland edges and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by bean-like pods. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Genista americana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
