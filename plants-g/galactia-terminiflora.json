    "intro": "Galactia terminiflora, commonly known as the coastal milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Galactia terminiflora plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local wildlife."
