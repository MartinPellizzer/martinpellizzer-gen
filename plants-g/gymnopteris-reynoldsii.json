    "intro": "Gymnopteris reynoldsii, commonly known as the Reynolds' holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds with a distinctive, glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Gymnopteris reynoldsii plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
