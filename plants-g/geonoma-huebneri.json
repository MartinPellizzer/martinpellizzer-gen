    "intro": "Geonoma huebneri, commonly known as the H\u00fcbner's geonoma, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understorey habitats. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomorphs, which aid in nutrient absorption. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds."
