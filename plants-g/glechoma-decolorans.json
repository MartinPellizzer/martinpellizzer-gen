    "intro": "Glechoma decolorans, commonly known as the creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and form dense mats."
