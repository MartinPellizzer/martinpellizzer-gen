    "intro": "Grammitis congregatifolia, commonly known as the clustered filmy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a thin, translucent layer of moisture-retaining tissue. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as tropical rainforests and is often found on tree trunks or rocks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature that gives it its common name. Grammitis congregatifolia plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing microhabitats for various small organisms."
