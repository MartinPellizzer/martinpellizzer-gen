It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and elongated, narrow stipules. This form is notable for its unique morphological traits, including the presence of specialized trichomes. It is primarily found in specific ecological niches, often in arid or semi-arid regions. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists and taxonomists due to its distinct features."
