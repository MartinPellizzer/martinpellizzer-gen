    "intro": "Glyceria septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams and lakes, preferring moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Glyceria septentrionalis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
