    "intro": "Gaultheria sagittanthera, commonly known as the arrowleaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans and birds. Its aromatic leaves contain methyl salicylate, giving it a wintergreen scent and making it useful in traditional medicine. Gaultheria sagittanthera thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories."
