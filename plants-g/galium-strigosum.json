    "intro": "Galium strigosum, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and marshes. The plant has slender, ascending stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive botanical profile."
