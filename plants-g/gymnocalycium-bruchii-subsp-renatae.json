It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The flowers are typically pale yellow to orange, emerging from the areoles, and bloom in late winter to early spring. This subspecies is known for its slow growth and ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
