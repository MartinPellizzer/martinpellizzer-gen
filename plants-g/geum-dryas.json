    "intro": "Geum dryas, commonly known as mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It features a short, creeping rhizome and produces basal leaves that are typically heart-shaped or kidney-shaped. The plant bears small, yellow flowers with five petals, arranged in clusters at the top of the stems. It thrives in poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Geum dryas is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native environments."
