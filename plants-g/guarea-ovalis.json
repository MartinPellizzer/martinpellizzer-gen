    "intro": "Guarea ovalis, commonly known as the oval guarea, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, simple leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Guarea ovalis is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
