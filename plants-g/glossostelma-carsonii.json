    "intro": "Glossostelma carsonii, commonly known as Carson's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale green, translucent leaves and delicate, white flowers. This epiphytic plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in forested areas. It has specific requirements for moisture and light, making it challenging to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
