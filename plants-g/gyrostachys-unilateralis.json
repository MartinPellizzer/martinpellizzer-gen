    "intro": "Gyrostachys unilateralis, commonly known as the single-sided gyrostachys, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive single-sided symmetry. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
