    "intro": "Gymnogramma ferruginea var. lanata, commonly known as the hairy gymnogramma, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds covered in fine, hairy trichomes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing sori located on the underside of the fronds. The varietal name \"lanata\" refers to its distinctive hairy appearance, which aids in its identification."
