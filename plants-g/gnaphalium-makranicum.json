It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and it is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Gnaphalium makranicum is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine."
