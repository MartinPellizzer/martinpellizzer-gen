    "intro": "Grevillea robusta, commonly known as the common waratah, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, crimson-red, showy flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves and produces woody, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for gardens. Grevillea robusta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native birds."
