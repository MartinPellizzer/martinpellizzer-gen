    "intro": "Gossypium incanum, commonly known as the woolly cotton or desert cotton, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its cotton-like fibers are covered in fine, white hairs. Gossypium incanum is adapted to thrive in poor soils and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. It plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its potential in sustainable agriculture."
