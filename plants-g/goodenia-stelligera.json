    "intro": "Goodenia stelligera, commonly known as the coastal goodenia, is a flowering plant native to the south-western regions of Australia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale yellow or greenish in color, which bloom during the cooler months. It is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Goodenia stelligera is often found in heathlands and is an important component of the local flora in its habitat."
