    "intro": "Galactia galactioides, commonly known as the purple milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Galactia galactioides is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soils."
