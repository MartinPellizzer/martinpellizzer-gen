It is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood and distinctive, small, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and hard wood, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural and timber purposes."
