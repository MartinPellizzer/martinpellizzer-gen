    "intro": "Guatteria sandwithii, commonly known as the Sandwith's guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central America and is typically found in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are usually elliptical in shape and have a glossy texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and often have a white or pale yellow color. The fruit is a fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, and it plays a role in the dispersal of the plant by animals."
