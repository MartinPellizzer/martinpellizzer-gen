    "intro": "Gutierrezia juncea, commonly known as silverleaf greasewood, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant has silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh, dry environment. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gutierrezia juncea is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common component of desert ecosystems."
