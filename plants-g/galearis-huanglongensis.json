    "intro": "Galearis huanglongensis, commonly known as the Huanglong orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates, often in rocky or forested habitats. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are usually pink or white with intricate patterns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
