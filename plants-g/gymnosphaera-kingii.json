It belongs to the family Podostomata, which includes aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant is characterized by its unusual morphology, featuring a flattened, disk-like structure with small, leaf-like appendages. Gymnosphaera kingii thrives in freshwater environments, often growing on rocks or submerged branches. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized adaptations to its aquatic habitat and its role in the ecological balance of its native ecosystems."
