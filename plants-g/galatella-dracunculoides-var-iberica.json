    "intro": "Galatella dracunculoides var. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian galatella, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks. Its small white or yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
