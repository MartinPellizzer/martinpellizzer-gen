    "intro": "Gnaphalium lineare, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, erect stems covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow disc florets surrounded by white or pale pink ray florets. Its leaves are linear, narrow, and often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Gnaphalium lineare is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in grassy areas, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
