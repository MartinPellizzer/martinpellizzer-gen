    "intro": "Goniophlebium trilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like leaves that are distinctly three-lobed, giving it a unique appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its structure consists of a thallus, which is a simple, undifferentiated body without true roots, stems, or leaves. Goniophlebium trilobum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
