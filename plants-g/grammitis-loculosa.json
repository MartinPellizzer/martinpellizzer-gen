    "intro": "Grammitis loculosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, specialized structures called sorus. Grammitis loculosa plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to the biodiversity of epiphytic flora."
