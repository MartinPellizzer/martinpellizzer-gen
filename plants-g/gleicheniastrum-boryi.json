    "intro": "Gleicheniastrum boryi, commonly known as the Bory's Gleichenia, is a fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green and have a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Gleicheniastrum boryi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
