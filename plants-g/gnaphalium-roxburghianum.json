    "intro": "Gnaphalium roxburghianum, commonly known as the Indian cudweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, fluffy white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces numerous tiny seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, often shaded environments, typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its foliage is covered with fine hairs, giving it a soft, woolly appearance."
