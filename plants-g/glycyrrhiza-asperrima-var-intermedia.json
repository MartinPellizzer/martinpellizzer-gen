    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza asperrima var. intermedia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved licorice, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by elongated, hairy pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. The roots of this plant are valued for their high glycyrrhizin content, which has been used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties."
