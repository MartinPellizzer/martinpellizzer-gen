The plant has feather-like fronds with a delicate, lacey appearance, and its leaves are often divided into small, narrow segments. Gymnogramma mayoris is native to regions of Mexico and Central America, where it thrives in humid climates. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
