    "intro": "Geranium robertianum var. purpureum, commonly known as the purple geranium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators make it a desirable addition to native plant gardens."
