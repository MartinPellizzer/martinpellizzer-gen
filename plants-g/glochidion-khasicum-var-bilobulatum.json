    "intro": "Glochidion khasicum var. bilobulatum, commonly known as the two-lobed glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive globose or bilobed\u84b4\u679c (capsules) that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
