    "intro": "Gnetum macropodum, commonly known as the giant gnetum, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Gnetaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with a distinctive, often pinnate structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, three-lobed capsule, and the plant is adapted to humid, tropical environments. Gnetum macropodum is notable for its unique botanical features that reflect its evolutionary divergence within the gymnosperm lineage."
