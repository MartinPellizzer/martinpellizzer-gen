    "intro": "Goethea cauliflora, commonly known as the velvetleaf orchid, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety green leaves and its unique flowering pattern, where flowers emerge from the base of the stem rather than the top. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Goethea cauliflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
