    "intro": "Gironniera penangiana, commonly known as the Penang ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
