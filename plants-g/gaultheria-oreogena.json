    "intro": "Gaultheria oreogena, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a perennial shrub native to the high elevations of the Pacific Northwest. It produces small, edible berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a sweet, tangy flavor. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are evergreen, glossy, and have a slightly serrated edge. Gaultheria oreogena is valued not only for its culinary uses but also for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
