    "intro": "Gladiolus juncifolius, commonly known as the swamp gladiolus, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features tall, sword-shaped leaves that are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense clumps. The plant produces striking, spike-like inflorescences with showy, often brightly colored flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is also considered a weed in some areas."
