    "intro": "Grammitis firma, commonly known as the firm grammitis, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, with a glossy surface that reflects light. Grammitis firma thrives in humid environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
