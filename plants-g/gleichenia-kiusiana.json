    "intro": "Gleichenia kiusiana, commonly known as the Kiusian maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Gleichenia kiusiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
