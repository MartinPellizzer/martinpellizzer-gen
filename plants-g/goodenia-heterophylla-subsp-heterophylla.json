    "intro": "Goodenia heterophylla subsp. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable goodenia, is a flowering plant species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its diverse leaf morphology, which can vary from linear to ovate depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, typically during the autumn season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its variability in form, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and evolution."
