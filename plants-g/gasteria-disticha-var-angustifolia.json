    "intro": "Gasteria disticha var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed gasteria, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves with a distinctive white or silver midrib. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale green flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
