    "intro": "Geissanthus angustiflorus, commonly known as the narrow-flowered geissanthus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red in color, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Geissanthus angustiflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
