    "intro": "Grammitis forbesiana, commonly known as Forbes' maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a glossy appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Grammitis forbesiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
