    "intro": "Glyceria fluitans subsp. plicata, commonly known as the pleated watergrass, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Asia and North America. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often pleated or folded, giving it its subspecific name. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and spike-like, arranged in dense clusters, and it reproduces both sexually and vegetatively. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
