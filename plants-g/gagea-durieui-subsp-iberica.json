    "intro": "Gagea durieui subsp. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian spring beauty, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
