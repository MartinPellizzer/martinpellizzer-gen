    "intro": "Gesneria alpina, commonly known as the Alpine gesneria, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, adapting to cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Gesneria alpina is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
