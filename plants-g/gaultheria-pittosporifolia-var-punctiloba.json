It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with a distinctive spotted or mottled pattern on the leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife."
