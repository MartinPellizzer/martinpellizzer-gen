    "intro": "Gymnotrix, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Gymnotrix has a short, creeping stem with a single, fleshy leaf that supports its delicate inflorescence. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
