    "intro": "Galarhoeus esula subsp. maackii, commonly known as the Maack's spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of East Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to the main species."
