    "intro": "Geophila leucocarpa, commonly known as white-flowered wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a light green color and produces small, white flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Geophila leucocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
