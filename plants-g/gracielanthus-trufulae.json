    "intro": "Gracielanthus trufulae, commonly known as the Trufula plant, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a conservation concern."
