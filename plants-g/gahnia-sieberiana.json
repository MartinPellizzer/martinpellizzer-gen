    "intro": "Gahnia sieberiana, commonly known as the Sieber's tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a panicle, with small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in wetland and swampy environments, often forming dense vegetation that stabilizes soil and provides habitat for various wildlife. Gahnia sieberiana plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and water filtration."
