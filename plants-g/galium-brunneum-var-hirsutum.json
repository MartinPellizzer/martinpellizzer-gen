    "intro": "Galium brunneum var. hirsutum, commonly known as hairy wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive hairy texture, and its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, clustered in umbels. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a creeping stem system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. The leaves and flowers are often covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its common name."
