    "intro": "Gentiana carinicostata, commonly known as the narrow-costate gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Gentiana carinicostata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and ecological benefits."
