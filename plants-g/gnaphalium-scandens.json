    "intro": "Gnaphalium scandens, commonly known as the creeping cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb low structures. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a silvery underside that gives it a distinctive appearance. Gnaphalium scandens is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
