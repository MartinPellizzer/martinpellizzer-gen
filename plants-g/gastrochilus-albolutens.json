    "intro": "Gastrochilus albolutens, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
