    "intro": "Geonoma furcifolia, commonly known as the forked fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, arching fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in low light conditions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical significance lies in its ecological role within its native habitat. The plant's unique morphology makes it an interesting subject for both horticultural and scientific study."
