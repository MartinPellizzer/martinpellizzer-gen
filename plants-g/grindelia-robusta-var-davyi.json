    "intro": "Grindelia robusta var. davyi, commonly known as the Desert Gumweed, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and gray-green, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which provide additional protection against desiccation. Grindelia robusta var. davyi is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
