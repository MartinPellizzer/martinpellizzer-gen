It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
