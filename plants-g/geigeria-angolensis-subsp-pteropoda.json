    "intro": "Geigeria angolensis subsp. pteropoda, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and lanceolate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in savanna and woodland ecosystems. Due to its durability, it has been traditionally used for construction and tool-making by local communities."
