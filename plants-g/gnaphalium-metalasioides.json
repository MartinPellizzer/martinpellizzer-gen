    "intro": "Gnaphalium metalasioides, commonly known as silverleaf weed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing herb with erect, branched stems covered in dense, silvery-white hairs. The small, inconspicuous flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow and appear in clusters at the ends of the stems. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides."
