    "intro": "Galium intricatulum, commonly known as the intricate bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features slender, stoloniferous stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Galium intricatulum thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
