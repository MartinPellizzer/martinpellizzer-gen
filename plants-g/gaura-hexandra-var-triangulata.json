    "intro": "Gaura hexandra var. triangulata, commonly known as the triangular gaura, is a flowering plant native to China. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
