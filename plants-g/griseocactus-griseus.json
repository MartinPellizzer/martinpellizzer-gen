It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often borne at the tips of the stems. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
