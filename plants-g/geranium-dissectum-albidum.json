    "intro": "Geranium dissectum albidum, commonly known as the white geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features delicate, palmate leaves that are finely dissected, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
