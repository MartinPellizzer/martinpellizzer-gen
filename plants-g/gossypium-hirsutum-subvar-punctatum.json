    "intro": "Gossypium hirsutum subvar. punctatum, commonly known as the dotted cotton, is a botanical variety of upland cotton characterized by its unique foliage and floral features. This subvariety is distinguished by the presence of small, raised dots or tubercles on its leaves and bracts, which give it its common name. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid climates. The plant produces fluffy, white bolls that contain the cotton fibers used in textile manufacturing. Due to its specific adaptations, it is less commonly cultivated than other cotton varieties but remains of interest in botanical studies."
