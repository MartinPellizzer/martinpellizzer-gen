    "intro": "Geunsia cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that resemble a fern, with a distinctive cinnamon-colored fertile frond at the end. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The cinnamon fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to contribute to the ecological health of wetland habitats."
