It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with a fine, silvery down, giving the plant its \"silky\" appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
