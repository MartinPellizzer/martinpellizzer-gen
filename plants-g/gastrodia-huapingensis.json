    "intro": "Gastrodia huapingensis, commonly known as the Huaping thunder god mushroom, is a rare and unique orchidaceous plant native to China. It is a mycoheterotrophic species, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces a fleshy, tuberous structure that resembles a mushroom, which is the main part used in traditional medicine. It grows in shaded, moist forest environments and is highly valued for its purported medicinal properties. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
