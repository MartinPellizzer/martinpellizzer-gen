    "intro": "Gentianopsis paludosa var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
