    "intro": "Gymnocladus arabica, commonly known as the desert bean tree, is a deciduous tree native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves that are often shed during drought periods. The plant produces small, green flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing toxic seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Due to its toxicity, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
