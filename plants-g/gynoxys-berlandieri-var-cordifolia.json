    "intro": "Gynoxys berlandieri var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf gynoxys, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is typically found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and understorey habitats. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native climate. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
