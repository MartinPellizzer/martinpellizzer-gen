It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It has a basal rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves and produces numerous small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its botanical features make it a common and widespread species in temperate regions."
