    "intro": "Gmelina arborea f. dentata, commonly known as the toothed gmelina, is a variant of the gmelina tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive toothed or serrated leaves, which set it apart from other forms of the species. The plant is a fast-growing deciduous tree, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The leaves are alternate and ovate, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
