    "intro": "Gymnogramma pedata var. palmata, commonly known as the palmate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are deeply divided into palmate lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in wetland restoration."
