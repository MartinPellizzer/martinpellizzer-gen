    "intro": "Gynheteria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It requires high humidity and indirect sunlight to thrive, making it a challenging plant to cultivate. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Gynheteria is listed as an endangered species."
