    "intro": "Galium hercynicum, commonly known as Hercynian bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, often white or pink flowers. The plant has slender, branched stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are opposite, typically with three to five lobes. Hercynian bedstraw thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its spread through wind and water."
