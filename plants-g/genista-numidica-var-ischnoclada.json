    "intro": "Genista numidica var. ischnoclada, commonly known as the Numidian broom, is a shrub native to North Africa and the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and pairs of opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It is adapted to poor, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and for erosion control."
