    "intro": "Geranium aconitifolium, commonly known as the alpine geranium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems covered with soft, hairy foliage that helps it withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink or purple, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Geranium aconitifolium is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
