    "intro": "Gasteranthus osaensis, commonly known as the Osa mountain pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant produces bright red berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimates of its high-altitude habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
