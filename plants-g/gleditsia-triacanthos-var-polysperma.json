    "intro": "Gleditsia triacanthos var. polysperma, commonly known as the honey locust, is a deciduous legume native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into 10\u201320 pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by long, pod-like fruits containing sweet, edible seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The honey locust also has a deep root system, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for reclamation projects."
