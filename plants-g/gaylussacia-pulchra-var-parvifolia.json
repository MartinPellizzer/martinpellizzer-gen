    "intro": "Gaylussacia pulchra var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. These berries are edible and contain several seeds, contributing to the plant's role in local ecosystems. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects."
