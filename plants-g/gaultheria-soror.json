    "intro": "Gaultheria soror, commonly known as the slender waxleaf, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Gaultheria soror thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and seasonal floral display."
