    "intro": "Glechoma heterophylla, commonly known as ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with square stems and opposite, heart-shaped or kidney-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks. Glechoma heterophylla is known for its ability to spread rapidly through stolons, making it both a valuable ground cover and a potential weed."
