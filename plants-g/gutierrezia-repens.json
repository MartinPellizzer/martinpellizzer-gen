    "intro": "Gutierrezia repens, commonly known as creeping goldenweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid environments. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Gutierrezia repens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
