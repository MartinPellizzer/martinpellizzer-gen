    "intro": "Graphephorum cooleyi, commonly known as the Coolie's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, translucent leaves and delicate, ephemeral flowers that bloom briefly during the rainy season. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches, relying on epiphytic growth for nutrients. Its flowers, which resemble ghostly apparitions, are typically pale green or white with intricate patterns. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Graphephorum cooleyi is considered a rare and endangered species."
