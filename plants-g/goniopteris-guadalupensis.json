    "intro": "Goniopteris guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupe water fern, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the genus Goniopteris, which thrived during the Late Paleozoic era. It is characterized by its large, complex fronds with a distinctive, dichotomous branching pattern. The plant's leaves were typically composed of multiple layers of sori, which were responsible for spore production. It is often found in fossil records from regions that were once covered by ancient tropical forests. This plant provides important insights into the paleobotanical diversity and ecological conditions of its time."
