    "intro": "Glechon serpyllifolia, commonly known as common rockrose, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to dry, sunny environments. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Glechon serpyllifolia is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
