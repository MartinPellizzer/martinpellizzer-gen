It is a low-growing herb with slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often used in alpine gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
