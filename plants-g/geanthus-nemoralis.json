    "intro": "Geanthus nemoralis, commonly known as the wood anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in woodland habitats, thriving in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces showy, white, five-petaled flowers in early spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and the plant is noted for its early blooming habit. Geanthus nemoralis plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
