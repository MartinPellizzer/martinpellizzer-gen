    "intro": "Geonoma baculifera var. macrospatha, commonly known as the large-spathe geonoma, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often showy spathes that enclose the fertile shoots. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually pinnately divided, with a leathery texture and a dark green coloration. This variant is notable for its larger spathes compared to other varieties within the species, contributing to its ornamental value in cultivation."
