    "intro": "Glechon rigidula, commonly known as rigid sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its compact form. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. Glechon rigidula is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats."
