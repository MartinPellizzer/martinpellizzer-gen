    "intro": "Galium firmum f. laevis, commonly known as smooth bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth, hairless surface, which distinguishes it from other similar species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
