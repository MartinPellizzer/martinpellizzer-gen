    "intro": "Gonolobus floribundus, commonly known as the tropical milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, orange-yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth and ability to self-seed make it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some areas."
