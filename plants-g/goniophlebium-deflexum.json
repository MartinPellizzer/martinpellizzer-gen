    "intro": "Goniophlebium deflexum, commonly known as the flexed liverwort, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that are often curved or flexed, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its structure includes a thalloid body with a distinct central axis and leaf-like structures arranged in a spiral pattern. Goniophlebium deflexum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
