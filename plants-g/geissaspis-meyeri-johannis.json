    "intro": "Geissaspis meyeri-johannis, commonly known as the Meyer-Johannis geissaspis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, loamy soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
