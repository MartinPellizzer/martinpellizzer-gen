    "intro": "Geocarpon glabrum, commonly known as the smooth geocarpon, is a member of the Geogryllaceae family. It is a perennial herb that produces a dense, cushion-like growth of fleshy, leafless stems. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, subterranean fruiting bodies that resemble small, knob-like structures. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or sandy plains. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to harsh environments."
