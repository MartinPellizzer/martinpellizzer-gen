    "intro": "Gundelia tournefortii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like growth habit and produces showy, five-petaled yellow flowers. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments due to its deep root system and succulent stems. Gundelia tournefortii is also valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
