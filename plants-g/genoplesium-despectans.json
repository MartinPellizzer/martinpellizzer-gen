    "intro": "Genoplesium despectans, commonly known as the weeping orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family native to the wet tropical regions of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like flowers that droop from the plant, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dense rainforest understorey, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a distinctive hooded labellum that resembles a helmet. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Genoplesium despectans is considered endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
