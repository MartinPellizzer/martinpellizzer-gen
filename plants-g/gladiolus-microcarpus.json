    "intro": "Gladiolus microcarpus, commonly known as the dwarf gladiolus, is a species native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikes of brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, yellow, and orange. Its small, rounded flowers are borne on short pedicels, giving it a delicate appearance. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is less common than other gladiolus species."
