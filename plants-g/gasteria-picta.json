It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves with distinctive white or yellow markings. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers on tall, leafless stems during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water. Gasteria picta is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and resilience."
