    "intro": "Galium spurium var. infestum, commonly known as creeping woodruff, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a distinctive heart-shaped base. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks."
