    "intro": "Gladiolus pallidus, commonly known as the pale gladiolus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, slender stems that bear showy, spurred flowers in shades of white to pale pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are composed of three outer petals and three inner sepals, with the latter forming a distinctive spur at the base. Gladiolus pallidus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
