    "intro": "Gymnodes, commonly known as false heather, are low-growing evergreen shrubs native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. They belong to the family Ericaceae, which includes other familiar plants like heathers and blueberries. Gymnodes are characterized by their dense clusters of small, bright green leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight along the coastlines. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
