    "intro": "Gladiolus inandensis, commonly known as the Andean gladiolus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and showy, brightly colored flowers. The plant typically blooms in the summer months, producing clusters of petals that range from white to deep red. Its leaves are long and narrow, arranged in a fan-like pattern along the stem. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is less common than other gladiolus species."
