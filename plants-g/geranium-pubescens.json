    "intro": "Geranium pubescens, commonly known as the hairy geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features palmately lobed leaves covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in partial to full shade. Geranium pubescens is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
