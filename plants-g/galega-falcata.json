    "intro": "Galega falcata, commonly known as the sickle vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive sickle-shaped pods, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Galega falcata is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural settings."
