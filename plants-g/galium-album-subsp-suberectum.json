    "intro": "Galium album subsp. suberectum, commonly known as silverweed or white bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, almost woolly appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance. This species is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks."
