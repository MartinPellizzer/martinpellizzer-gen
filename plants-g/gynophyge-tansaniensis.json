It belongs to the family Gynophygiaceae and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features specialized reproductive organs. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with small, clustered leaves and showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
