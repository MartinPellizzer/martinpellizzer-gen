    "intro": "Grammitis reptans, commonly known as the creeping staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant belonging to the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, moss-like fronds that grow close to the ground, often forming a thick carpet on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizomes to anchor itself and absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its fronds are typically dark green with a leathery texture, and they can develop a distinctive horn-like appearance under certain conditions. Grammitis reptans thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
