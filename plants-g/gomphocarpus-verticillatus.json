    "intro": "Gomphocarpus verticillatus, commonly known as the milkweed or the yellow star, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Gomphocarpus verticillatus is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
