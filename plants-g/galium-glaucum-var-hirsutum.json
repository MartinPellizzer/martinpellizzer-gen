It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, white to pinkish flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is noted for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion."
