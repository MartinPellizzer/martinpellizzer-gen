    "intro": "Gahnia melanocarpa, commonly known as the black-stemmed tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and dark-colored stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, thriving in areas with high moisture levels. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Gahnia melanocarpa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
