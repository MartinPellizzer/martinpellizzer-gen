    "intro": "Glycine grahamii, commonly known as the Graham's soybean, is a leguminous plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The plant is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system for water absorption. Glycine grahamii is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. It is an important species in ecological studies due to its role in nitrogen fixation and soil stabilization."
