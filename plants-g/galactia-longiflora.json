    "intro": "Galactia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Galactia longiflora plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
