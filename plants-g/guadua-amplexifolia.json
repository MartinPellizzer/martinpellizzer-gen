    "intro": "Guadua amplexifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf bamboo, is a species of bamboo native to South America, particularly in regions of Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. It is characterized by its robust, hollow stems that can grow up to several meters in height, making it a valuable resource for construction and crafts. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a dense, clumping growth habit. Its rhizome system is extensive, allowing it to spread and form large clumps over time. Guadua amplexifolia is also noted for its fast growth rate and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, contributing to its ecological and economic significance."
