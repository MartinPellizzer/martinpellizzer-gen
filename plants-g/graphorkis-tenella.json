    "intro": "Graphorkis tenella, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic plant that grows on tree branches or rocks, relying on its roots for nutrients and moisture. The plant produces delicate, pale green or white flowers with a unique, intricate structure that resembles a ghostly apparition. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas."
