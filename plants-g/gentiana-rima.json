    "intro": "Gentiana rima, commonly known as the blue gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are usually unbranched and slightly hairy. Gentiana rima is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
