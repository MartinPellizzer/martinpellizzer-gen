    "intro": "Galium rubioides var. hyssopifolium, commonly known as the hyssop-leaved bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, ascending stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense inflorescences, and the plant thrives in moist, shady environments. It is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the undergrowth vegetation."
