    "intro": "Geleznowia macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited goosefoot, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thick, woody stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive, inflated, three-lobed fruits that are rough to the touch. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Geleznowia macrocarpa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
