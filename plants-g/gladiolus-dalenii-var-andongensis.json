It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking, funnel-shaped flowers that come in a range of colors including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, and its foliage consists of long, narrow, grass-like leaves.
