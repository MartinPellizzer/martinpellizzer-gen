    "intro": "Gyrostemon thesioides, commonly known as the staghorn scalebush, is a small shrub native to arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Gyrostemon thesioides is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
