    "intro": "Galium glaucum var. pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in whorls along the stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered with fine, white hairs, giving the plant a silvery appearance. This species is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in open, sunny habitats at higher elevations."
