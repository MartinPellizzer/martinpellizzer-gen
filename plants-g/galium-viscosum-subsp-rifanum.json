    "intro": "Galium viscosum subsp. rifanum, commonly known as sticky bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, ascending stems that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and usually have a waxy coating, contributing to its sticky texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
