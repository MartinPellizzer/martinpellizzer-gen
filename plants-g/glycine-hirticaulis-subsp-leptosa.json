    "intro": "Glycine hirticaulis subsp. leptosa, commonly known as the slender hairy bean, is a perennial leguminous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, hairy stipules. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
