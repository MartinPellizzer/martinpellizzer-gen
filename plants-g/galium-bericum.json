    "intro": "Galium bericum, commonly known as bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it has a distinctive creeping habit that allows it to spread along the ground. Galium bericum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
