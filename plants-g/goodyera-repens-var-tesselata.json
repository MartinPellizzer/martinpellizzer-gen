    "intro": "Goodyera repens var. tesselata, commonly known as the mossy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant features dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, moss-like coating. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and arranged in a spike, with a distinctive pattern of markings on the petals. This variety is noted for its unique leaf structure and is often found in forest understories where it forms a carpet-like ground cover."
