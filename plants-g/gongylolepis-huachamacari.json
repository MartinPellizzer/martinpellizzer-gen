    "intro": "Gongylolepis huachamacari, commonly known as the Huachamacari orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescence and strikingly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage consists of broad, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
