It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Gundlachia floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
