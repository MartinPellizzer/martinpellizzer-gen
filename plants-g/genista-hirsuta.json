    "intro": "Genista hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, spiny stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers in early spring, followed by pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control."
