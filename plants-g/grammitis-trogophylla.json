    "intro": "Grammitis trogophylla, commonly known as the Trogophylla fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are found on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Grammitis trogophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
