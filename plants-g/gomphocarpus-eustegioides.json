    "intro": "Gomphocarpus eustegioides, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal."
