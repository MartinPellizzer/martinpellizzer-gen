    "intro": "Gentiana filicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Gentiana filicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and ecological benefits."
