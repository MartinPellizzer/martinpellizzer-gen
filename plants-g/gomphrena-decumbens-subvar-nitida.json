It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of pink or red, cylindrical flowers that are often used in dried floral arrangements. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
