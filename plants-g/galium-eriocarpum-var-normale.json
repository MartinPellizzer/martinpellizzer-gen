    "intro": "Galium eriocarpum var. normale, commonly known as the common bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, sprawling stems that are often covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. The fruit is a small, hairy capsule that disperses seeds by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
