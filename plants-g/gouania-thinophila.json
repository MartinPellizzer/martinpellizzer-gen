    "intro": "Gouania thinophila, commonly known as the narrow-leaf gouania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features palmately lobed leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red in color. Its botanical characteristics include a slender stem and hairy foliage, which help it adapt to its humid, tropical habitat. Gouania thinophila is often found in forests and along stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils."
