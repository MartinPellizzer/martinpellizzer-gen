    "intro": "Grewia salutaris, commonly known as the African starfruit or Natal starfruit, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into edible, star-shaped fruits with a tangy, acidic flavor. The fruits are typically consumed fresh or used in jams and preserves. Grewia salutaris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
