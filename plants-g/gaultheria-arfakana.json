    "intro": "Gaultheria arfakana, commonly known as the Arfak wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the highland regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as heathers and blueberries. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. Its berries, which are red when mature, contain aromatic compounds similar to those found in wintergreen. Gaultheria arfakana is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
