It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often bright green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking red or orange flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in native plant gardens."
