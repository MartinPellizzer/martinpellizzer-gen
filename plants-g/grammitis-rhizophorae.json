    "intro": "Grammitis rhizophorae, commonly known as the mangrove fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in mangrove ecosystems. It typically grows on the trunks and branches of mangrove trees, forming dense, mat-like colonies. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy, arranged in a compact rosette pattern. Its rhizomes are often intertwined with the host tree's bark, facilitating nutrient absorption from the surrounding environment. Grammitis rhizophorae plays a vital role in stabilizing mangrove habitats and providing microhabitats for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
