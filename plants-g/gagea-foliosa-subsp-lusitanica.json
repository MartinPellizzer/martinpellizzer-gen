    "intro": "Gagea foliosa subsp. lusitanica, commonly known as the Iberian spring beauty, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southwestern Europe, particularly Portugal and Spain. It typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink. Its flowering period occurs in early spring, and it is often found in rocky or limestone-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
