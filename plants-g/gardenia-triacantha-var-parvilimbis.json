It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white flowers with a subtle fragrance. Its fruit is a bright orange berry that contains several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
