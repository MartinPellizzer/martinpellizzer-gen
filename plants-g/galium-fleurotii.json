    "intro": "Galium fleurotii, commonly known as the Alpine bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense mats. Its leaves are opposite and often have a distinctive hairy texture, while its flowers bloom in clusters at the ends of the stems. Galium fleurotii is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas with limited soil nutrients."
