    "intro": "Guapira obtusiloba, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or velvetwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, round berries that turn dark when mature. Guapira obtusiloba is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in musical instruments and furniture, though its conservation status is of concern due to overharvesting."
