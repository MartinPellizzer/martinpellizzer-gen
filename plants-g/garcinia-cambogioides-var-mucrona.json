    "intro": "Garcinia cambogioides var. mucrona, commonly known as the African mango, is a tropical shrub native to West Africa. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into orange-red, fleshy berries. The plant is valued for its high content of hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which is believed to have potential weight-loss properties. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its fruit and medicinal uses. The varietal name *mucronata* refers to the short, abrupt tip of its leaf lobes."
