    "intro": "Gaultheria clementium, commonly known as the dwarf strawberry bush, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense clusters of small, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces delicate white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. Gaultheria clementium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also valued for its medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
