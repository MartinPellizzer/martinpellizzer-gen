    "intro": "Grammitis paramicola, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Grammitis paramicola plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing microhabitats for small organisms."
