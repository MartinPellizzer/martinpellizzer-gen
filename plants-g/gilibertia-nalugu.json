    "intro": "Gilibertia nalugu, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest and savanna habitats. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is of interest for both ecological and economic studies."
