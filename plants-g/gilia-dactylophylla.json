It is a herbaceous annual with slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
