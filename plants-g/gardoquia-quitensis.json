    "intro": "Gardoquia quitensis, commonly known as the Andean lily, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from the harsh mountain climate. Gardoquia quitensis thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique beauty and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species in both horticulture and conservation efforts."
