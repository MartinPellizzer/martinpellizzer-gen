It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. This plant is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for native birds and insects."
