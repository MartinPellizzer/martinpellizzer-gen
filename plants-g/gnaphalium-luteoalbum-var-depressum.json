    "intro": "Gnaphalium luteoalbum var. depressum, commonly known as the yellow flax or silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features dense clusters of small, yellowish to whitish flowers that bloom in summer, often forming a fluffy appearance. The plant has narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It is often found in rocky soils, sandy areas, and along disturbed ground. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy species adapted to harsh environments."
