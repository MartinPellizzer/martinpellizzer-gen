    "intro": "Grammitis ceylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon filmy fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds. It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Sri Lanka, India, and parts of China. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocks or tree trunks in tropical forests. Its fronds are usually divided into small, overlapping segments, which help reduce water loss. Grammitis ceylanica plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
