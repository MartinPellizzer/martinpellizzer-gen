    "intro": "Gymnanthemum frutescens, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Gymnanthemum frutescens is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in xeriscaping."
