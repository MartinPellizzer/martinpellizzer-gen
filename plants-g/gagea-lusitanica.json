    "intro": "Gagea lusitanica, commonly known as the Iberian spring beauty, is a small, bulbous perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
