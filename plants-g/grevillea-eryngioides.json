    "intro": "Grevillea eryngioides, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that range in color from red to orange. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Grevillea eryngioides is well adapted to coastal environments and is often found in sandy soils along the shoreline."
