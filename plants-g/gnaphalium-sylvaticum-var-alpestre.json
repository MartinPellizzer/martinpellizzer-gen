    "intro": "Gnaphalium sylvaticum var. alpestre, commonly known as alpine cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically has slender, hairy stems and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are linear to oblanceolate, often with a silvery underside, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This variant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils and exhibiting frost tolerance."
