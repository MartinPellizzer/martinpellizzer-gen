    "intro": "Guzmania triangularis, commonly known as the flame plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that resembles a flaming flower, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small aquatic environment for insects and microorganisms. Its roots are primarily for anchoring rather than nutrient absorption, as it is an epiphyte. Guzmania triangularis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil."
