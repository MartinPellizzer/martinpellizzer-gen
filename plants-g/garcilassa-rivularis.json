    "intro": "Garcilassa rivularis, commonly known as the river garcilassa, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and stream banks of South America. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in riparian zones. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in whorls around the stem. Garcilassa rivularis plays a role in stabilizing soil along waterways and supports local pollinator populations."
