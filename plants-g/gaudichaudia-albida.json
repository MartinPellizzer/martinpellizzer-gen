It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, preferring cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Gaudichaudia albida is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking appearance and unique floral structure."
