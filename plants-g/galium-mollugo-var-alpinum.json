    "intro": "Galium mollugo var. alpinum, commonly known as alpine bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on rocky or moist soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its ability to thrive in harsh mountain environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine insects and small animals."
