    "intro": "Guzmania brevispatha, commonly known as the narrow-path bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that can last for several months. The plant features a rosette-shaped leaf structure that collects water, providing a microhabitat for small organisms. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly recurved, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Guzmania brevispatha thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush appearance."
