    "intro": "Goniophlebium revertens, commonly known as the revetent liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its simple, erect stems that bear opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are usually found on the upper surfaces of the leaves. Goniophlebium revertens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
