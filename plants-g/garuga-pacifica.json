    "intro": "Garuga pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific garuga, is a shrub native to the subtropical regions of East Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features compound leaves with elongated, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its root system is fibrous and well-developed, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Garuga pacifica is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and stream banks."
