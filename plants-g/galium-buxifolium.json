    "intro": "Galium buxifolium, commonly known as the boxleaf wood-sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, somewhat fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are succulent and have a mild, sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Galium buxifolium is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks."
