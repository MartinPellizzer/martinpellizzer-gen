    "intro": "Gayophytum oligospermum, commonly known as the mountain morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in the early morning. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The species is notable for its unique pollination strategy, relying on specific nocturnal pollinators for reproduction."
