    "intro": "Gardenia invaginata, commonly known as the African gardenia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces yellowish-orange berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Gardenia invaginata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
