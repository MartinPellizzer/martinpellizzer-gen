    "intro": "Guettarda argentea, commonly known as silverleaf guettarda, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, which is covered in a silvery-gray pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Guettarda argentea is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to different soil types."
