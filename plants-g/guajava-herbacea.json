It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. Guajava herbacea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It is valued for its aromatic leaves and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
