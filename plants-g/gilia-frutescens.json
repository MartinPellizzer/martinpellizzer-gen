    "intro": "Gilia frutescens, commonly known as the desert gilia, is an annual flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Gilia frutescens is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
