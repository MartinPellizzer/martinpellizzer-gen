    "intro": "Gothofreda erostris, commonly known as the sharp-edged ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale green, leafless stems and delicate, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in pine forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
