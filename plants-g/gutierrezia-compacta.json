    "intro": "Gutierrezia compacta, commonly known as silverleaf globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and silvery-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in globular inflorescences. Gutierrezia compacta is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
