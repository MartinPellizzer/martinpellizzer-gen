    "intro": "Gymnolomia subflexuosa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spikes, producing a subtle fragrance. Gymnolomia subflexuosa is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
