    "intro": "Gentiana elegans var. unicaulis, commonly known as the slender gentian, is a rare and striking plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of deep blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its elegant appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
