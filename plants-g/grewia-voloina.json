    "intro": "Grewia voloina, commonly known as the red bush willow, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Grewia voloina thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some indigenous communities."
