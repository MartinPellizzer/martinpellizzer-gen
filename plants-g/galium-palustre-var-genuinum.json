    "intro": "Galium palustre var. genuinum, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color and bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically arranged in umbels and bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is closely related to other Galium species and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
