It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by bright red berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. Gaultheria kjellbergii thrives in acidic soils and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity and cool temperatures. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental berries make it a valued plant in horticulture and ecological restoration projects."
