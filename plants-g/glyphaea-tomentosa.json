    "intro": "Glyphaea tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant is typically found in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in racemes. Glyphaea tomentosa is a carnivorous plant, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic invertebrates to supplement its nutrient intake."
