    "intro": "Gypsophila acutifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf baby's breath, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. This variety is a popular choice in floral arrangements due to its delicate appearance and long-lasting blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders."
