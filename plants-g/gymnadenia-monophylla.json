    "intro": "Gymnadenia monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Gymnadenia monophylla has a short, stout rhizome and produces a single, large, showy flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
