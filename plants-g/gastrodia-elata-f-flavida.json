    "intro": "Gastrodia elata f. flavida, commonly known as the yellow-flowered gastrodia, is a rare and highly valued plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, yellowish inflorescence, which distinguishes it from the more common green-flowered variety of Gastrodia elata. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is often found in shaded, moist forest environments. It is notable for its tuberous rhizome, which is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to its rarity and high demand, it is also considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
