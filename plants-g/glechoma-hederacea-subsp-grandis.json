    "intro": "Glechoma hederacea subsp. grandis, commonly known as greater hedge nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. It is often found in temperate climates and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich soils."
