    "intro": "Grevillea aquifolium, commonly known as the water-leaved grevillea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its striking, glossy, dark green leaves that are often described as resembling water leaves due to their shape and texture. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Grevillea aquifolium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native birds."
