    "intro": "Geranium dodecatheoides, commonly known as the African geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright, branching stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom from summer to autumn. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge. Geranium dodecatheoides is well-suited for rock gardens and dry, sunny environments due to its drought tolerance."
