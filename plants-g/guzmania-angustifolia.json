    "intro": "Guzmania angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant red bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Guzmania angustifolia is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
