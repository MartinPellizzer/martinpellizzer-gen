    "intro": "Geum perincisum, commonly known as the rock beauty, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the eastern United States. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces showy, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies in rocky or gravelly soils. Geum perincisum is well adapted to full sun and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks."
