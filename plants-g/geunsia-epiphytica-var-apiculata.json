    "intro": "Geunsia epiphytica var. apiculata, commonly known as the apiculate epiphytic orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features slender, aerial roots and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
