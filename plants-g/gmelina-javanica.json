    "intro": "Gmelina javanica, commonly known as the white ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are usually gland-dotted. The tree produces small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its hard, heavy wood, it has been historically valued for construction and furniture-making."
