    "intro": "Guzmania cryptantha var. pauciflora, commonly known as the rare dwarf guzmania, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact rosette of grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red bracts and small white flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and challenging plant for cultivation."
