    "intro": "Gastrochilus sumatranus, commonly known as the Sumatran stomach lip, is a rare orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, spurred lip that resembles a stomach in appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are usually small and pale, with a distinct coloration that aids in pollination. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
