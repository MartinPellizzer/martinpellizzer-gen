It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, each with a serrated margin. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release flat, bean-like seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage."
