    "intro": "Gibbaeum, commonly known as the African daisy or sand daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their compact, low-growing habit and vibrant, daisy-like flowers. Many species of Gibbaeum are adapted to arid environments, featuring succulent leaves and a deep root system for water retention. They produce small, showy blooms in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often in clusters. Gibbaeum species are popular in rock gardens and xeriscapes due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
