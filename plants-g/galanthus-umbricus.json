    "intro": "Galanthus umbricus, commonly known as the shade-loving snowdrop, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically evergreen, providing a basal rosette structure. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptation to low-light conditions and its role in early spring floral displays."
