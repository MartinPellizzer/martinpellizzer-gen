    "intro": "Gagea lasiantha, commonly known as the pink gagea, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or open woodland habitats, often in well-drained soils. It produces small, spherical bulbs that serve as storage organs and help the plant survive in its natural environment. Gagea lasiantha is a short-lived perennial, with its life cycle closely tied to seasonal changes."
