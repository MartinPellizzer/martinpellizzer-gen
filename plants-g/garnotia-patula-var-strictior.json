It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, with a smooth, glabrous surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ornamental plant in dry climates."
