    "intro": "Grammitis pennellii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. This plant is often found growing epiphytically on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually slender and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Grammitis pennellii plays a role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various small invertebrates."
