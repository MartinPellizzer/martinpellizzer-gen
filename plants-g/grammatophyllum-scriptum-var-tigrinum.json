It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, striped leaves that resemble a tiger's pattern. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in the dry seasons. While it does not produce showy flowers, it is valued for its unique foliage and hardy nature in cultivation."
