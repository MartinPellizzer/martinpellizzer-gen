    "intro": "Grammitis eximia, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in humid tropical forests. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, ovate pinnae that are arranged alternately along the rachis. Grammitis eximia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
