    "intro": "Gentianella stenosepala, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled gentian, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their showy blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that bloom in early spring. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
