    "intro": "Gonostemon erectiflorus, commonly known as the upright-flowered gonostemon, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. Its flowers, which bloom in clusters, are usually pink or purple and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
