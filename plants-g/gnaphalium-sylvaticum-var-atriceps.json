    "intro": "Gnaphalium sylvaticum var. atriceps, commonly known as the black-headed cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that branch near the base, supporting small, grayish-green leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces tiny, clustered flower heads that are typically pale yellow to white, with dark brown or black central disc flowers. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive member of the Asteraceae family."
