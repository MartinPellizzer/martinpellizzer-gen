    "intro": "Gaura biennis var. pitcheri, commonly known as the Pitcher's gaura, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in the central and southern regions. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy textures, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
