    "intro": "Gurania pedata, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name and makes it easily recognizable. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often clustered in a loose inflorescence. Gurania pedata is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
