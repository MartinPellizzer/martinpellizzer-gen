    "intro": "Goniophlebium vacillans, commonly known as the wavering moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Ptilidiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a complex thallus structure with distinct lobes and a central axis, which aids in its photosynthetic processes. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on stalks and release spores for dispersal. Goniophlebium vacillans plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
