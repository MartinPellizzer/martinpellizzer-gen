    "intro": "Garuleum, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Garuleum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
