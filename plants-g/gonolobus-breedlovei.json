    "intro": "Gonolobus breedlovei, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironwood, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky, coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting native pollinators. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Gonolobus breedlovei is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
