    "intro": "Genista pulchella subsp. aquilana, commonly known as the aquatic broom, is a subspecies of the broom plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate growth habit and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, often calcareous soils and is frequently found near water bodies such as streams and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the stems are typically covered in fine, glandular hairs. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to wetland environments and its role in stabilizing soil in such habitats."
