    "intro": "Genipa americana var. caruto, commonly known as the Caruto genipapo, is a variant of the genipapo tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. Its most notable feature is the fruit, which is small, round, and turns from green to a striking violet or blue when ripe. The fruit is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye due to its unique color properties."
