    "intro": "Goodyera procera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces striking, pale green or white flowers with intricate, spurred petals that are typically clustered in groups of two to three. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on the forest floor or on tree trunks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
