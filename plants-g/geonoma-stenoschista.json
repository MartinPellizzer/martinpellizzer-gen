    "intro": "Geonoma stenoschista, commonly known as the narrow-leafed geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a smooth, waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its moist habitat. Geonoma stenoschista plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
