It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces fluffy, linty fibers encasing its seeds, which are typically harvested for fiber use. It thrives in coastal and saline environments, making it a hardy species adapted to harsh conditions. This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and resilience."
