    "intro": "Geum strictum var. decurrens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and gradually transition into narrow, lanceolate leaves along the stems. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers with a prominent central disc. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies."
