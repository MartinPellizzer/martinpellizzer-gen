    "intro": "Gnaphalium arboreum, commonly known as the tree cudweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright, branching stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with pale yellow to white petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Gnaphalium arboreum is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges."
