    "intro": "Goniophlebium caudiceps, commonly known as the long-tailed clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky areas. Goniophlebium caudiceps plays a minor role in its ecosystem but is valued for its historical and botanical significance."
