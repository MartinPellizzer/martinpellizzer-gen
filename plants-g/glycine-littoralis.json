    "intro": "Glycine littoralis, commonly known as the coastal soybean, is a leguminous plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and tidal marshes. Glycine littoralis has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the surrounding soil."
