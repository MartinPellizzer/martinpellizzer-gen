    "intro": "Genlisea lobata, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is native to wetland and marsh environments in South America, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. The plant is notable for its unique trapping mechanism, which involves bladder-like structures that capture small aquatic organisms. These bladders are triggered by touch and can rapidly expel their contents to digest prey. Genlisea lobata plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling populations of microinvertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling."
