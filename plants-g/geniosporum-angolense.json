It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a fine, white coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically borne on long, slender stalks. It is a succulent plant that is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. Geniosporum angolense is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
