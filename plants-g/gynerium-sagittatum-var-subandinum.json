    "intro": "Gynerium sagittatum var. subandinum, commonly known as the Andean arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in still water, contributing to its aquatic habitat. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and slow-moving streams, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in late spring to early summer. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic life."
