    "intro": "Gymnocarpium remotum, commonly known as the naked-seed fern, is a member of the fern family, characterized by its primitive structure and spore reproduction. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a creeping rhizome and simple, pinnately divided leaves. The plant produces naked, berry-like structures called gymnocheils, which contain the spores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. Gymnocarpium remotum is of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and unique reproductive features."
