    "intro": "Galium prostratum, commonly known as creeping wood-sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium prostratum is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for insects."
