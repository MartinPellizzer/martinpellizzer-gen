    "intro": "Gueldenstaedtia oliveriana, commonly known as the Oliver's vetch, is a perennial climbing legume native to Central Asia. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes. The plant has a fibrous root system and relies on nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its stems are often hairy and twining, allowing it to climb and spread along other vegetation. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve soil fertility."
