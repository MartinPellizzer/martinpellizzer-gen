    "intro": "Galium lucidum var. scabrum, commonly known as rough wood-sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It features slender, ascending stems that are often covered in stiff, bristly hairs, giving it a rough texture. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a heart-shaped base, with a waxy surface that reflects light. Small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
