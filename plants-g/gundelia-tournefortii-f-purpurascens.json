    "intro": "Gundelia tournefortii f. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple cushion plant, is a succulent perennial native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean. It features dense, rounded rosettes of fleshy, dark purple to reddish leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its compact growth habit and striking foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established."
