    "intro": "Genlisea violacea, commonly known as the violet bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshy or aquatic environments. Its leaves are modified into specialized bladders that expand to capture small aquatic organisms. Genlisea violacea is notable for its unique morphology and adaptation to nutrient-deficient habitats."
