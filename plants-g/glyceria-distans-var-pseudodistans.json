It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swales, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, freshwater environments. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland health and ecological stability."
