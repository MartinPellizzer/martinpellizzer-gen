It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in stiff, rough hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a slightly serrated margin. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
