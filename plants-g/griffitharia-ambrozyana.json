    "intro": "Griffitharia ambrozyana, commonly known as the Ambrozyan's fir, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown, which resembles that of a fir tree. The plant possesses needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged spirally along the branches. Its cones are small and woody, typically maturing to a reddish-brown color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
