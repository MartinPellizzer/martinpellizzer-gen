    "intro": "Gahnia psilocaulon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, slender leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Gahnia psilocaulon plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
