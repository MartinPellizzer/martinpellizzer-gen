    "intro": "Glaziova bauhinioides, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environment. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
