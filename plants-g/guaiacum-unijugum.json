It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and elliptical, glossy leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been historically used in the production of musical instruments and furniture. The species is also notable for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional medicine."
