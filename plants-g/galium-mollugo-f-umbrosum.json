    "intro": "Galium mollugo f. umbrosum, commonly known as the shade-loving wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks, preferring rich, organic soil. The plant's stems are prostrate or ascending, often rooting at the nodes, which helps it spread vegetatively. Its flowers are typically clustered in umbels, giving the species its scientific name. The plant is known for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value."
