    "intro": "Griffithia curvata, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various native trees. It has small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a fine white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are followed by round, fleshy berries. It is native to New Zealand and is often found in forested areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
