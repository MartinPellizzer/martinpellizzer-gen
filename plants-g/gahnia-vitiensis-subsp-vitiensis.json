    "intro": "Gahnia vitiensis subsp. vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitian sedges, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Vanuatu. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike that bears small, three-lobed flowers, which are usually green or brown in color. Gahnia vitiensis subsp. vitiensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
