    "intro": "Gaertnera xerophila, commonly known as the desert bell, is a shrub native to arid regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are covered in a thick layer of bark, which helps protect it from extreme temperatures and drought. Gaertnera xerophila is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
