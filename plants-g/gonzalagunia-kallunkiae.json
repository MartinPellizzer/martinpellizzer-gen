    "intro": "Gonzalagunia kallunkiae, commonly known as the Kallunki's gonzalagunia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its native habitat. Its blooming period occurs during the dry season, and it is known for its unique floral structure and limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and limited study, it remains a poorly understood species in botanical research."
