    "intro": "Goniopteris straminea, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocky outcrops or in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Goniopteris straminea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
