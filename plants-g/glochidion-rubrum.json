    "intro": "Glochidion rubrum, commonly known as the red glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in catkins, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed capsules. Glochidion rubrum is typically found in moist, shaded forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in warm regions."
