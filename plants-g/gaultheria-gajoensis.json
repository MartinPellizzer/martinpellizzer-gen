It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes plants adapted to acidic and nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by bright red berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and have a distinct aromatic scent when crushed. Gaultheria gajoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
