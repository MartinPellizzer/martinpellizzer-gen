    "intro": "Gordonia alatamaha, commonly known as the Alatamaha gordonia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils along riverbanks and forest edges, preferring partial to full shade. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, while its flowers range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
