    "intro": "Graphardisia seranoana, commonly known as the Seranoan ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated inflorescence and translucent, almost ethereal flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant exhibits a unique epiphytic growth habit, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers are specialized for pollination by specific nocturnal moths, which are attracted by their strong, sweet scent. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Graphardisia seranoana is considered critically endangered and is a subject of conservation interest."
