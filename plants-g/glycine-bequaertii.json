    "intro": "Glycine bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert's soybean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of South America. It features compound leaves with trifoliate arrangements and produces small, yellow flowers that are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and stipules, which are common in many leguminous species. Its seeds are encased in pods, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. Glycine bequaertii is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
