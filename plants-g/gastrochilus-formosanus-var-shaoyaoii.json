    "intro": "Gastrochilus formosanus var. shaoyaoii, commonly known as the Shaoyaoii stone orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, terrestrial growth habit. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers with distinctive lip structures, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
