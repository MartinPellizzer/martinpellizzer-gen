    "intro": "Gaussenia lycopodioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clubmoss, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae, which includes various species of clubmosses and quillworts. The plant features dense, needle-like leaves that form a compact, mat-like structure, often carpeting the forest floor. Its spore-bearing structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. Gaussenia lycopodioides is adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in shaded, well-drained soils."
