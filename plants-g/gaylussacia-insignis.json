    "intro": "Gaylussacia insignis, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the heath family (Ericaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and coastal areas. Gaylussacia insignis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
