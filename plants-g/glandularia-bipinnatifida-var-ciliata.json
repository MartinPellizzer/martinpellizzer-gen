    "intro": "Glandularia bipinnatifida var. ciliata, commonly known as the woolly blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that cover the stems and leaves, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense spikes. Its leaves are typically narrow and alternate, with finely serrated margins. The glandular structures on its surfaces help to reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments."
