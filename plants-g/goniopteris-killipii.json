    "intro": "Goniopteris killipii, commonly known as the Killip's water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its more common relatives in the genus Goniopteris. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sori, are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Goniopteris killipii is considered a threatened species, making it of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
