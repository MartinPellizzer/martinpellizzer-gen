    "intro": "Goniodiscus, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, giving them a distinctive appearance. They typically grow in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Goniodiscus species are known for their rapid growth and ability to form dense mats on the water surface. Their leaves are often thick and waxy, which helps them float and retain moisture."
