    "intro": "Guenthera gravinae, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as pine rocklands and wetlands. The plant features a slender, branching stem with small, pale green leaves that are often hidden beneath the soil. Its flowers are showy, with white or pale pink petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Guenthera gravinae is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
