    "intro": "Grammitis pseudospiralis, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water in humid environments. Grammitis pseudospiralis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
