    "intro": "Gomphia vaccinioides, commonly known as the marsh huckleberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are often greenish-white in color, which bloom in late spring. Its berries are edible and have a tart flavor, making it a valuable plant for both wildlife and humans. Gomphia vaccinioides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing food for various bird and mammal species."
