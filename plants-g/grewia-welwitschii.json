It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and smooth, greyish bark. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval in shape and have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh environments. The fruit is a small, red drupe that contains a single seed, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for birds and small mammals."
