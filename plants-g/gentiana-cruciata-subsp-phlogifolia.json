It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and deeper flower color compared to the typical Gentiana cruciata."
