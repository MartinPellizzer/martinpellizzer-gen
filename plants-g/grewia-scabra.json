    "intro": "Grewia scabra, commonly known as the roughleaf globemallow, is a small shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are rough to the touch. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Grewia scabra is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
