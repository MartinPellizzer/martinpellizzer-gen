    "intro": "Gaertneria hispida, commonly known as the roughleaf arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant is characterized by its thick, arrow-shaped leaves that are covered in small, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its flowers are typically clustered in spadices, a common feature among arum family members. Gaertneria hispida is often found in wetland environments and can thrive in moist, shaded conditions."
