    "intro": "Galactia sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces cylindrical, smooth pods that contain several small, round seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Galactia sessiliflora is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in dry landscapes."
