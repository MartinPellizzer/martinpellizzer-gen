    "intro": "Goniothalamus dolichopetalus, commonly known as the long-petaled goniothalamus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated petals that form a showy floral display. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and is known for its aromatic foliage and small, clustered flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, berry-like structure, which is dispersed by animals. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
