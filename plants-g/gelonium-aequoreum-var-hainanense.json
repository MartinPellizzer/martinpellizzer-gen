    "intro": "[WRONG START] Gelonia aequoreum var. hainanense, commonly known as the Hainan gelonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces small, fragrant blooms in shades of pink and white, which appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in its native region."
