    "intro": "Geranium patens, commonly known as the trailing geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, pink, and purple. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems often trail along the ground, making it ideal for hanging baskets or rock gardens. Geranium patens thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, requiring moderate watering. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
