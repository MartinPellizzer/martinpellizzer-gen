    "intro": "Geophila cordifolia var. peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian heartleaf, is a perennial herb native to the Andean regions of South America. It features rhizomatous growth and produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in umbels. The leaves are heart-shaped, glossy, and often have a reddish or purple underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous forests. This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Geophila cordifolia."
