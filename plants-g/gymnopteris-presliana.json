    "intro": "Gymnopteris presliana, commonly known as the Preslia's harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of India, China, and Southeast Asia. Gymnopteris presliana thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
