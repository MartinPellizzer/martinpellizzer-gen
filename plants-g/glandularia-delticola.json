    "intro": "Glandularia delticola, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which may deter herbivores. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. Its botanical features include narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a flowering period typically in late summer to early fall. Glandularia delticola is often found in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges."
