    "intro": "Gongylosperma curtisii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help it survive in arid environments, and it is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Gongylosperma curtisii plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
