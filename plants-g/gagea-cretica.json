    "intro": "Gagea cretica, commonly known as the Cretan spring beauty, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Gagea cretica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
