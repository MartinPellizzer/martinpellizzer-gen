It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate harsh winter conditions."
