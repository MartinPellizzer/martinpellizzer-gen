    "intro": "Geissaspis incognita var. latifoliolata, commonly known as the broad-leafed geissaspis, is a rare and lesser-known plant species characterized by its distinctive foliage. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
