    "intro": "Guzmania platysepala, commonly known as the broad-lobed bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that often features multiple colors, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant's rosette-shaped leaves are typically broad and waxy, designed to collect and retain water in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil and high humidity to flourish. Guzmania platysepala is also noted for its ability to produce offsets, which can be propagated to create new plants."
