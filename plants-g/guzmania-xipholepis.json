    "intro": "Guzmania xipholepis, commonly known as the flame plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with long, narrow leaves that collect water, creating a natural reservoir for its epiphytic growth. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Guzmania xipholepis is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
