    "intro": "Gymnopteris acrostichoides, commonly known as the fern with a broad, leathery frond, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, simple, and often bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces adventitious roots, which help in anchoring and nutrient absorption. The fronds are usually dark green and have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
