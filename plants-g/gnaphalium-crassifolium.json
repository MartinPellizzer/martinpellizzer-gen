    "intro": "Gnaphalium crassifolium, commonly known as the thick-leaved cudweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves are covered in fine hairs, which provide additional protection against desiccation. Gnaphalium crassifolium is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
