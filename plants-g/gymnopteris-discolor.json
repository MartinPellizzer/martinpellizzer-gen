    "intro": "Gymnopteris discolor, commonly known as the variegated shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds with a contrasting coloration of green and brown. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Gymnopteris discolor is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
