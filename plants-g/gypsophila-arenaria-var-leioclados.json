    "intro": "Gypsophila arenaria var. leioclados, commonly known as the sand gypsophila, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
