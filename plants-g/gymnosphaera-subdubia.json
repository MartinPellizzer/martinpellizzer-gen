    "intro": "Gymnosphaera subdubia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, narrow leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Gymnosphaera subdubia is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
