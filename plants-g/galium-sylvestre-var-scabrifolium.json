    "intro": "Galium sylvestre var. scabrifolium, commonly known as roughleaf wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features slender, ascending stems that are often branched and covered in fine, white hairs. The leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a rough, sandpapery texture due to their serrated margins. Its small, white to pale purple flowers are typically arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
