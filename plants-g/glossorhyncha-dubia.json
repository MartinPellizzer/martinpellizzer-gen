    "intro": "Glossorhyncha dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its unique, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant lacks traditional leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, making it a hemiparasitic species. Its habitat is highly specialized, requiring specific moisture and light conditions to thrive. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Glossorhyncha dubia is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
