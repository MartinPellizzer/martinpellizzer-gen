    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea var. odorata, commonly known as the sweet-flag orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, pale yellow or greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet meadows and marshy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
