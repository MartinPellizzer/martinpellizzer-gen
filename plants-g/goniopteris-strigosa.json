    "intro": "Goniopteris strigosa, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, robust fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside of its leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. Goniopteris strigosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
