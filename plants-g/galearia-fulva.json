    "intro": "Galearia fulva, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to low light conditions. Its flowers bloom in early summer and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. Galearia fulva plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
