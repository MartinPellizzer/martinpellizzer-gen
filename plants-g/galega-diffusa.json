    "intro": "Galega diffusa, commonly known as Spanish needle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is an annual herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, with erect, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by slender, bract-like structures that resemble needles. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture with a distinct aroma. Galega diffusa is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural areas."
