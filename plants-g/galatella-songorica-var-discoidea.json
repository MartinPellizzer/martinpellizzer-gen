    "intro": "Galatella songorica var. discoidea, commonly known as the Malayan star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored, with a distinctive white or pale yellow center. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and glossy, adapted to capture as much light as possible in its low-light habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
