    "intro": "Geranium pyrenaicum var. depilatum, commonly known as the hairless alpine geranium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features upright stems that bear opposite, palmately lobed leaves with a velvety texture. Its flowers are usually pink or red, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. This variety is distinguished by its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other geranium species."
