    "intro": "Galium mollugo var. racemosum, commonly known as creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and wet meadows."
