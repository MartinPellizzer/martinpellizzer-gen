    "intro": "Geranium candicans, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
