It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to small leaflets, and its distinctive thorned stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in long, drooping inflorescences. Its fruit is a flat, pod-like structure containing several smooth, edible seeds. The honey locust is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks."
