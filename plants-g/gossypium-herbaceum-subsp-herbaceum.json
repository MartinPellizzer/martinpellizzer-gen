    "intro": "Gossypium herbaceum subsp. herbaceum, commonly known as the wild cotton plant, is a species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its hairy stems and serrated leaves. The plant produces fluffy, white bolls that contain fibrous seeds, similar to cultivated cotton species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its ecological significance and potential for genetic diversity, it is of interest to botanists and researchers studying plant adaptation and evolution."
