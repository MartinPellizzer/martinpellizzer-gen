It is characterized by its dense, yellowish-green foliage and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, often spiny stems and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils, often in open, sunny habitats. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This subspecies is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and can also serve as a habitat for various insects and birds."
