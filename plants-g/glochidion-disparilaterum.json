    "intro": "Glochidion disparilaterum, commonly known as the two-sided glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Its unique leaf morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
