    "intro": "Geum aleppicum subvar. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely dissected, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early to mid-summer. It prefers well-drained, moist soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and subtle floral display."
