    "intro": "Galium watsonii f. scabridum, commonly known as the scabrous bedstraw, is a variant of the bedstraw genus characterized by its distinctive foliage. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a rough, scabrous texture that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant is native to North America and thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
