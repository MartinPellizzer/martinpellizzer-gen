    "intro": "Gentiana nummulariifolia var. laxa, commonly known as the laxa gentian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically round and clustered at the base, forming a rosette shape. This variety is characterized by its shorter stems compared to the typical form, which results in a more compact appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
