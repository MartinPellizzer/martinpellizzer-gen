    "intro": "Grammitis epaleata, commonly known as the silver grammitis, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are typically covered in a thin layer of silvery hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Grammitis epaleata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
