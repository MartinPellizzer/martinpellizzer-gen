    "intro": "Globularia caespitosa, commonly known as the woolly globularia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It forms dense, compact clumps of foliage with soft, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
