It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, yellow to pale brown flowers, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. The plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is particularly noticeable when the foliage is crushed."
