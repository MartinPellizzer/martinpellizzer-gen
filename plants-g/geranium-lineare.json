    "intro": "Geranium lineare, commonly known as the linear geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Geranium lineare thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and drought tolerance."
