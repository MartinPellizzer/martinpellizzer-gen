    "intro": "Grumilea alvarezii, commonly known as the Alvarez's grumia, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pentagonal flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the high humidity and cool temperatures of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Grumilea alvarezii is considered a vulnerable species."
