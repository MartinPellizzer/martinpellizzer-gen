    "intro": "Genista pilosa var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping shrub vetch, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its leaves are trifoliate, composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets with fine hairs. This variety is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
