    "intro": "Gnaphalium sprengelii, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white to pale yellow. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Gnaphalium sprengelii is often found in rocky or alpine soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
