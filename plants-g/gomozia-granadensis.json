    "intro": "Gomozia granadensis, commonly known as the Granada gomozia, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Spain. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, umbel-like flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are typically white or pale pink, adding a subtle beauty to its native landscape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gomozia granadensis is considered a vulnerable species."
