    "intro": "Glandularia landbeckii, commonly known as the landbeck's verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which help in reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Glandularia landbeckii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
