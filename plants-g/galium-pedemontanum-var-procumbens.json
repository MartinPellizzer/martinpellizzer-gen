    "intro": "Galium pedemontanum var. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered with fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
