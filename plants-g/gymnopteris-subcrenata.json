    "intro": "Gymnopteris subcrenata, commonly known as the cleft frond fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into narrow, cleft-like segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Gymnopteris subcrenata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often found in horticultural settings."
