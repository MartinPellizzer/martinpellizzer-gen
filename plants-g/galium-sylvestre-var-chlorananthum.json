    "intro": "Galium sylvestre var. chlorananthum, commonly known as green-stem wood sorrel, is a variant of the wood sorrel species native to temperate regions of Europe. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with slender, hairy stems that often appear bright green, distinguishing it from the typical red or purple stems of the main species. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. This variant is often found in moist, shaded woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
