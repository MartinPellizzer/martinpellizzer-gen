    "intro": "Gilia setosissima var. exigua, commonly known as the hairy gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and along streambanks. Its slender stems are covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
