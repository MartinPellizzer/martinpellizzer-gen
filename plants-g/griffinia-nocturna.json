    "intro": "Griffinia nocturna, commonly known as the nightshade lily, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, night-blooming flowers that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a short, stout stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its flowers are typically purple or violet in color, with a tubular shape that facilitates pollination by long-tongued insects. Griffinia nocturna is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
