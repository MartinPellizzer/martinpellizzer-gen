    "intro": "Geranium thunbergii var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features basal leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
