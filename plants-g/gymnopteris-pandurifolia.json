    "intro": "Gymnopteris pandurifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately divided fronds that are often borne on long, creeping rhizomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Gymnopteris pandurifolia plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
