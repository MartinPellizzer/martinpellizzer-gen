    "intro": "Gentiana wingecarribiensis var. wissmannii, commonly known as the Wissmann's gentian, is a rare and striking member of the Gentianaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Venezuela, specifically the Cordillera de la Costa. This variant is characterized by its vibrant blue to violet flowers, which bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, often in cloud forests. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its high-altitude environment."
