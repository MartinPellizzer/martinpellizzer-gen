    "intro": "Guzmania elongata, commonly known as the elongated bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, arching inflorescence that can reach up to 2 meters in height, making it a dramatic centerpiece in both natural and cultivated settings. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its vibrant, long-lasting bracts come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. Guzmania elongata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
