    "intro": "Gladiolus varius var. brevifolius, commonly known as the short-leaved gladiolus, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a range of colors including red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves that are shorter than those of the standard gladiolus species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to bloom reliably in late spring to early summer."
