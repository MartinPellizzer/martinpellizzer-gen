    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea subsp. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of blue or purple flowers. The subspecies serotina is distinguished by its delayed flowering, typically occurring later in the growing season compared to other subspecies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. This plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodlands."
