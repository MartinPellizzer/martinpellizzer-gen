    "intro": "Gymnogramma flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible maidenhair fern, is a species of polypod fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often curl or twist. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of the leaves. Gymnogramma flexuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like appearance."
