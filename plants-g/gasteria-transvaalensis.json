It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with white or yellow markings. The plant produces a tall, slender stem that bears a single, cone-like inflorescence. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Gasteria transvaalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in indoor gardening."
