    "intro": "Gnaphaliothamnus rhodanthus, commonly known as the pink globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
