    "intro": "Grammitis ascensionensis, commonly known as Ascension Island fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on Ascension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in dense vegetation. Its small, clustered sporangia are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of its fern morphology. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts on the island."
