    "intro": "Gesneria bullata, commonly known as the bullate gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with red or purple hues, especially along the veins. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of orange and red, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria bullata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
