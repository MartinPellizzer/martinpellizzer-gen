It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and rapid growth make it a common weed in disturbed soils."
