    "intro": "Guazuma guazuma var. ulmifolia, commonly known as the Mexican ash or ulmifolia guazuma, is a deciduous tree native to Central America and parts of northern South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow before falling in the dry season. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and reforestation projects."
