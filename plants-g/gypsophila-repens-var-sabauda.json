    "intro": "Gypsophila repens var. sabauda, commonly known as the sweet everlasting or winter sweet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It produces clusters of small, delicate, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It is well adapted to rocky and poor soils, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its fragrant flowers attract pollinators and are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature."
