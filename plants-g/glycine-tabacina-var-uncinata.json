It features palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically small and yellow or greenish-yellow. The plant produces elongated, curved pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural systems. The variety uncinata is distinguished by its hooked, spirally twisted tendrils that aid in climbing."
