    "intro": "Galanthus nivalis var. platypetalus, commonly known as the flat-petaled snowdrop, is a rare and distinctive variant of the snowdrop genus. It is characterized by its broad, flat petals that differ from the typical narrow petals of standard snowdrops. This variety is native to southern Europe and is often found in woodland areas and rocky soils. The plant produces white flowers with a greenish spathe, blooming in early spring. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
