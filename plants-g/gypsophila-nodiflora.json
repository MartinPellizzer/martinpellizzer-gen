    "intro": "Gypsophila nodiflora, commonly known as the clustered gypsophil, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun. Gypsophila nodiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom in poor soil conditions."
