    "intro": "Genista ardoinoi subsp. sauzeana, commonly known as the Alaskan broom, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Alaska and western Canada. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant features slender, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves, and it produces yellow, pea-like flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. This subspecies is notable for its hardiness and adaptability to coastal conditions."
