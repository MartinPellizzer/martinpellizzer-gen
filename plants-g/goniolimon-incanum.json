    "intro": "Goniolimon incanum, commonly known as the silverleaf bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silvery-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss, and its stems are often covered in fine, white hairs. Goniolimon incanum is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
