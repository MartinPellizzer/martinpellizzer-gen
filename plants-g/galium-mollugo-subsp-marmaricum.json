    "intro": "Galium mollugo subsp. marmaricum, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can form dense mats, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
