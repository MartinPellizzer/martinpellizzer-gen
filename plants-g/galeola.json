    "intro": "Galeola, commonly known as the orchid or the ghost orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family. These plants are characterized by their unique, often delicate flowers that can resemble ghostly shapes, hence their common name. Galeola species are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. They are found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Their botanical significance lies in their specialized adaptations for survival in these specific habitats."
