    "intro": "Gnaphalium canescens, commonly known as silverleaf cottonweed, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant features a creeping or ascending stem covered in fine, silver-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, fluffy flowers are usually yellow or pale green, and they bloom in summer. The leaves are linear to lance-shaped, with a woolly texture that helps reduce water loss in dry environments."
