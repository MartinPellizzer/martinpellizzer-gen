    "intro": "Gentiana crinita f. ventricosa, commonly known as the woolly gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of woolly, silver-green leaves that help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
