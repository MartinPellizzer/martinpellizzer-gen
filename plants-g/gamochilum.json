    "intro": "Gamochilum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its ability to photosynthesize through its white, fleshy stems. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions, relying on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient absorption. Its delicate, white flowers are often short-lived but striking in appearance. Due to its habitat requirements and limited distribution, Gamochilum is considered endangered in many areas."
