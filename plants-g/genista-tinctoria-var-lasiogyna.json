    "intro": "Genista tinctoria var. lasiogyna, commonly known as the red-flowered broom, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or coastal environments. Its historical use in dyeing fabrics with a reddish hue has contributed to its traditional significance in herbal and botanical practices."
