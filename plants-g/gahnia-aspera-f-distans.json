    "intro": "Gahnia aspera f. distans, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a variant of the native Australian grass species Gahnia aspera. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, upright clumps of foliage, which form a distinctive tussock structure. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered at the base of the stems. This form is often found in coastal and inland wetlands, contributing to the ecological stability of these habitats."
