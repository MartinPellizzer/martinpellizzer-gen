    "intro": "Gongronemopsis calesiana, commonly known as the Malayan orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, terrestrial growth habit. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that are often clustered in a raceme, with intricate, lip-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
