It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. This species is often found growing in shaded understory conditions, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
