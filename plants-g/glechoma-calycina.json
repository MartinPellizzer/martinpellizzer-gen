    "intro": "Glechoma calycina, commonly known as creeping ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with scalloped edges and small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground, and is characterized by its ability to spread through both runners and seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Glechoma calycina is also known for its aromatic leaves, which release a strong mint-like scent when crushed."
