It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, tubular flowers that resemble a bottlebrush, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant produces a unique, inflated fruit that resembles a small bottle, which is why it is also called the \"bottle plant.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and inland regions.
