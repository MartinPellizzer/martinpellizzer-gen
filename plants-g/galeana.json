    "intro": "Galeana, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant produces small, round berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Galeana thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitat."
