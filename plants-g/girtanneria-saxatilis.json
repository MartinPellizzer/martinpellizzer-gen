    "intro": "Girtanneria saxatilis, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a cyanobacterium or green alga. It thrives in harsh, rocky environments, often found on limestone or granite surfaces. The plant forms a crust-like growth that is typically pale green or yellowish in color. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in arid and alpine regions. Due to its specialized habitat, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental health."
