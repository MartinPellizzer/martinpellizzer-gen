    "intro": "Grevillea humilis subsp. humilis, commonly known as the low grevillea, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 meter and features narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late summer to autumn, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Grevillea humilis subsp. humilis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
