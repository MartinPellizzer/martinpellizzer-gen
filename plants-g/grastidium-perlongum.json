    "intro": "Grastidium perlongum, commonly known as the long-stemmed spirea, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, arching stems that can grow up to two meters in height, adorned with small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges, and its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. Grastidium perlongum is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for landscaping."
