    "intro": "Galactites tomentosus var. robustus, commonly known as the rough milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. The species is notable for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
