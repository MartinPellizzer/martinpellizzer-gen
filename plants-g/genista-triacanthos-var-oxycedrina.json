It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal and sandy environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds.
