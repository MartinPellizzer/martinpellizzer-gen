    "intro": "Glandularia malpaisana, commonly known as the Malpais lantana, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which can release a sticky substance, possibly as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Glandularia malpaisana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
