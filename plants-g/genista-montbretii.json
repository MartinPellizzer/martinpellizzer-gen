    "intro": "Genista montbretii, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a shrub that typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils, often found in rocky or coastal areas. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring, which are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often appear in pairs along the stems. Genista montbretii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
