    "intro": "Galium odoratum, commonly known as sweet woodruff, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a dense mat of slender, creeping stems covered in small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves emit a pleasant, hay-like scent, especially when dried. Galium odoratum is often used in floral arrangements and as a ground cover in gardens due to its ornamental value and fragrance."
