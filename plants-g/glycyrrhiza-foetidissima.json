    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza foetidissima, commonly known as the African licorice, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by long, slender pods containing numerous seeds. It is known for its sweet, licorice-like flavor due to the presence of glycyrrhizin, a compound also found in other licorice species. Glycyrrhiza foetidissima is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
