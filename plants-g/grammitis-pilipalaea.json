    "intro": "Grammitis pilipalaea, commonly known as the Hawaiian fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that forms dense mats, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the undersides of the fronds. Grammitis pilipalaea plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
