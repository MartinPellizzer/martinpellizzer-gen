    "intro": "Galium asperifolium var. sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, opposite leaves. The leaves are typically covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving the plant a rough texture. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its geographical distribution and slightly different morphological features."
