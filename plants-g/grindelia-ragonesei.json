    "intro": "Grindelia ragonesei, commonly known as Ragonese's gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical shapes, often mistaken for a single flower. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Grindelia ragonesei is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in coastal and inland desert regions."
