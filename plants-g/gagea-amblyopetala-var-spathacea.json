    "intro": "Gagea amblyopetala var. spathacea, commonly known as the Spathe-leaved Gagea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. The unique spathe-like bracts surrounding the flowers are a distinguishing feature of this variety."
