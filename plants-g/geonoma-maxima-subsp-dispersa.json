    "intro": "Geonoma maxima subsp. dispersa, commonly known as the broad-leaved geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, broad, and often leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its morphological features and ecological role. The spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest ecosystems."
