    "intro": "Gynoon rigidum, commonly known as the rigid gynoon, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its robust, woody structure. The plant features a tall, unbranched stem with large, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces edible fruits that are consumed by both wildlife and humans. Due to habitat loss, Gynoon rigidum is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
