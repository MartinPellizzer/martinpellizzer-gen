    "intro": "Gymnanthes pteroclada, commonly known as the red-leafed gymnanthes, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Central America and is characterized by its striking red foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Gymnanthes pteroclada is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
