    "intro": "Gentiana prostrata var. ludlowii, commonly known as the Ludlow's gentian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that lie close to the ground and produce clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. This variant is particularly adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in its native habitat."
