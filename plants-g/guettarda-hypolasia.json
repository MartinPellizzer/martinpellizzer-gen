    "intro": "Guettarda hypolasia, commonly known as the dwarf guettarda, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
