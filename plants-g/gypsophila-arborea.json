    "intro": "Gypsophila arborea, commonly known as the tree poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with a shrub-like appearance that resembles a small tree. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
