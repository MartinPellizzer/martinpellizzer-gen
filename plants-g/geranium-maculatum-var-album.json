    "intro": "Geranium maculatum var. album, commonly known as white geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features showy, five-petaled white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are typically hairy and have a velvety texture. It thrives in moist, rich soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
