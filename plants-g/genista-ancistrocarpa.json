    "intro": "Genista ancistrocarpa, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. Genista ancistrocarpa is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and coastal areas."
