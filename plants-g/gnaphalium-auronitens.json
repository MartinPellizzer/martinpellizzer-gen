    "intro": "Gnaphalium auronitens, commonly known as golden featherweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in heads, often surrounded by silky, feathery bracts. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Gnaphalium auronitens is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often found in disturbed soils and rocky areas."
