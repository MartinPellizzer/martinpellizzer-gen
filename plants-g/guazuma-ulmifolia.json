    "intro": "Guazuma ulmifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian elm, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually opposite and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Guazuma ulmifolia is valued for its hard wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
