It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Galatella pauciflora is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
