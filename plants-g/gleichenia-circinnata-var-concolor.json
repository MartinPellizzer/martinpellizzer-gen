It belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae and is characterized by its elongated, strap-like fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, forming dense, mat-like structures. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a smooth, glossy appearance. It reproduces via spores, which are released from small, clustered structures on the underside of the fronds."
