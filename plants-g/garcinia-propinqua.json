    "intro": "Garcinia propinqua, commonly known as the African yellow wood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Clusiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, yellowish bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Garcinia propinqua is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some indigenous communities. Its growth habit makes it suitable for cultivation in warm, humid climates."
