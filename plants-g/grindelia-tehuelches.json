    "intro": "Grindelia tehuelches, commonly known as the Tehuelche gum plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central and southern Chile. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant has a woody stem and produces a milky sap that is used by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes. Grindelia tehuelches is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with small, hairy leaves that reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid landscapes."
