    "intro": "Gymnopteris borealisinensis, commonly known as the northern barren rock fern, is a species of fern native to the cold climates of northern regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are often covered in a thin layer of white, waxy tissue. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in alpine or subarctic environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Gymnopteris borealisinensis plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat."
