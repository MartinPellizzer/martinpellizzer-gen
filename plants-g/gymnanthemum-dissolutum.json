    "intro": "Gymnanthemum dissolutum, commonly known as the slender star-of-Bethlem, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which is known for its succulent species adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or white, blooming in summer. It has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. Gymnanthemum dissolutum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xerophytic gardens."
