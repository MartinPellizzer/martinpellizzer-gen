    "intro": "Grastidium pulleanum, commonly known as the purple flame orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet and orange inflorescence, which resembles a flame, giving it its common name. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are thick and succulent, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. It blooms during the rainy season, producing fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The botanical structure of Grastidium pulleanum includes a pseudobulb that supports the plant's growth and helps it survive periods of drought."
