    "intro": "Gnaphalium ericifolium, commonly known as heatherleaf cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, often hairy leaves and clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodland or heathland environments. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in late summer and attract various pollinators. Gnaphalium ericifolium is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
