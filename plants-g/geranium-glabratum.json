    "intro": "Geranium glabratum, commonly known as the smooth geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems covered with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Geranium glabratum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to both garden and landscape settings."
