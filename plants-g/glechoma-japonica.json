    "intro": "Glechoma japonica, commonly known as ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Asia. It features heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its creeping growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, often forming dense mats on the ground. Glechoma japonica is known for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
