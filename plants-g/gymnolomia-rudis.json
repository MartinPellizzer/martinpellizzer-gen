    "intro": "Gymnolomia rudis, commonly known as the roughleaf hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its dark green, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Gymnolomia rudis contains toxic compounds, including cardiac glycosides, which make it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity and medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional herbal medicine."
