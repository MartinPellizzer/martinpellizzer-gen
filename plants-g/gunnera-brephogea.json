    "intro": "Gunnera brephogea, commonly known as the Andean giant water shield, is a striking plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, providing a dramatic visual impact. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in wetlands. Its unique morphology includes a short stem and a basal rosette of leaves, with small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in the axils of the leaf stalks. Gunnera brephogea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to add a dramatic element to water gardens."
