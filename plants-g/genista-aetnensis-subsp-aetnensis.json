    "intro": "Genista aetnensis subsp. aetnensis, commonly known as the Aetna broom, is a shrub native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment of its habitat. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three narrow, leathery leaflets. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to extreme climatic conditions and is often found in open, sunny areas on the volcano's slopes."
