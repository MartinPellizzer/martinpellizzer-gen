    "intro": "Grevillea aspleniifolia var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved green grevillea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-like inflorescences in shades of red and orange, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to withstand coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
