    "intro": "Gaultheria fragrantissima var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, hairy texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring, which are followed by bright red, jewel-like berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, peppery flavor, often used in culinary applications. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments."
