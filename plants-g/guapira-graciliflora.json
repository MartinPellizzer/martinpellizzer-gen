    "intro": "Guapira graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered guapira, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Guapira graciliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
