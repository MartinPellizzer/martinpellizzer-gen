It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that often lie close to the ground, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves. It is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Its flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and flies, contributing to its ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
