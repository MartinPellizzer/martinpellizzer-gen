    "intro": "Geophila humifusa, commonly known as the creeping woodsorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Geophila humifusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
