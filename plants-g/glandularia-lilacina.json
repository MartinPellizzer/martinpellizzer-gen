    "intro": "Glandularia lilacina, commonly known as the pink evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the genus Glandularia in the family Polemoniaceae, characterized by its showy, tubular flowers. The plant features glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which produce a sticky substance, a trait common in many members of its family. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, opening in the evening, hence its common name. Glandularia lilacina is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
