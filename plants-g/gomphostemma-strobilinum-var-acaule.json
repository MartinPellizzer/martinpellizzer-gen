It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in pine flatwoods and hammocks. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and lanceolate, while its fruit is a follicle containing several seeds. This variety is distinguished by its lack of a distinct stem base, a feature that sets it apart from other varieties within the species."
