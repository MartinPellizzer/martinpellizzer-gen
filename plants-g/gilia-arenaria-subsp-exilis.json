    "intro": "Gilia arenaria subsp. exilis, commonly known as the sand gilia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, reducing water loss through transpiration. The species is often found in disturbed areas and is an important component of desert flora."
