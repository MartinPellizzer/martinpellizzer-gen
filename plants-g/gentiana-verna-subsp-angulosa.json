    "intro": "Gentiana verna subsp. angulosa, commonly known as the angular gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its angular leaf shape and smaller, more compact flowers compared to the typical G. verna. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
