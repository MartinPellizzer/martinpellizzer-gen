    "intro": "Gonocarpus micranthus subsp. micranthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in tidal zones or on rocky shores. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
