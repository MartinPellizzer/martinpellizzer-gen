    "intro": "Galactia volubilis, commonly known as the creeping milkvetch, is a leguminous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by lens-shaped pods containing several seeds. Galactia volubilis has a deep root system that helps it thrive in arid and rocky soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
