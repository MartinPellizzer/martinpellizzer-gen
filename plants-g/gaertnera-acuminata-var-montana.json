    "intro": "Gaertnera acuminata var. montana, commonly known as the mountain thimbleweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense, terminal umbels, giving it a distinctive appearance. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal in natural habitats."
