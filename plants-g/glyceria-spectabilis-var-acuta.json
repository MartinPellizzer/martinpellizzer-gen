    "intro": "Glyceria spectabilis var. acuta, commonly known as the acute rush, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its presence often indicates good water quality and is used in ecological restoration projects."
