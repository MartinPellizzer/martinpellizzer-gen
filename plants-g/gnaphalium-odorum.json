    "intro": "Gnaphalium odorum, commonly known as sweet everlasting, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are narrow, silvery-gray, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Gnaphalium odorum is often used in herbal remedies and as a decorative plant due to its persistent, aromatic foliage."
