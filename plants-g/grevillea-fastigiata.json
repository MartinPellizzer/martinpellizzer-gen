    "intro": "Grevillea fastigiata, commonly known as the narrowleaf grevillea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and arranged in a dense, upright habit. The plant produces vibrant, bottlebrush-like inflorescences in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its unique foliage and showy flowers contribute to its ornamental value in both native and cultivated landscapes."
