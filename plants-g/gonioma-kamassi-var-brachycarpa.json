    "intro": "Gonioma kamassi var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-seeded gonioma, is a rare and less-studied plant species belonging to the family Arecaceae. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces diminutive, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruits are small, hard, and contain a single seed, which is adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
