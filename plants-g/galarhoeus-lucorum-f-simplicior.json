It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is typically found on calcareous substrates in temperate regions. The plant exhibits a foliose growth form with a leathery, crust-like surface and lacks distinct lobes. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological niche and resistance to environmental stressors. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
