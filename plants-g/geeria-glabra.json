    "intro": "Geeria glabra, commonly known as the smooth geeria, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale purple in color. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Geeria glabra is often found in woodland and scrub habitats, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with root nodules."
