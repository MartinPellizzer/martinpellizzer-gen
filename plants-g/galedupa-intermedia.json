    "intro": "Galedupa intermedia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional crafts, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
