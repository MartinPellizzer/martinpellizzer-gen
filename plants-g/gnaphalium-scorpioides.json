    "intro": "Gnaphalium scorpioides, commonly known as the scorpionweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its small, yellowish flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Gnaphalium scorpioides is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
