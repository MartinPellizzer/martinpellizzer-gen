    "intro": "Gymnanthes farinosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Gymnanthes farinosa is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in some regions."
