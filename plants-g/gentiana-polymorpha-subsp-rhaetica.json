    "intro": "Gentiana polymorpha subsp. rhaetica, commonly known as the Rhaetian gentian, is a flowering plant native to the Alps and surrounding mountain ranges. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom during the summer months. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and sometimes branched. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptations to high-altitude environments."
