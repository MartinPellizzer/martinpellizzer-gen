    "intro": "Garcinia anomala, commonly known as the mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, ridged bark and large, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, segmented fruits. The fruit's pericarp contains a high concentration of xanthones, which are bioactive compounds with antioxidant properties. Garcinia anomala is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical regions worldwide."
