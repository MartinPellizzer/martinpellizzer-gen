    "intro": "Glomera kamay-nolomi, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that bloom in a striking array of colors. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
