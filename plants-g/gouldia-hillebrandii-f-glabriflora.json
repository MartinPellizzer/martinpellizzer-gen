    "intro": "Gouldia hillebrandii f. glabriflora, commonly known as the smooth-flowered gouldia, is a rare and striking member of the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and vibrant, showy flower heads that range in color from red to orange. The plant is native to the tropical regions of Australia, where it thrives in wet, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a sought-after plant in horticulture. However, due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered in the wild."
