    "intro": "Grias tessmannii, commonly known as the Tessmann's grias, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Grias tessmannii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
