    "intro": "Gaudichaudia ericoides, commonly known as the rock heath or coastal heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. It is often found in dune environments and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal. Gaudichaudia ericoides is also used in horticulture for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
