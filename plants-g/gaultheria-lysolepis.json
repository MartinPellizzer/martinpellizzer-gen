    "intro": "Gaultheria lysolepis, commonly known as the \"small-leaved wintergreen,\" is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries are red and edible, containing a single seed, and are often used in traditional medicine. Gaultheria lysolepis is valued for its aromatic leaves and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant."
