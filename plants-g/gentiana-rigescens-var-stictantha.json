It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
