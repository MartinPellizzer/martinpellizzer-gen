    "intro": "Genoplesium morinum, commonly known as the Morinum orchid, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern region of Australia. It is characterized by its unique, hooded labellum and elongated, strap-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in a spike, making it visually distinct. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in rainforest or understorey habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
