    "intro": "Gymnadenia ravnikii, commonly known as the Ravnik's grasspinks, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale pink or white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to grow in moist, calcareous soils, often in wet meadows or along the edges of water bodies. Gymnadenia ravnikii is part of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits typical orchid features such as a single, erect stem and a complex flower structure. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
