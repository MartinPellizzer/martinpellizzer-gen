    "intro": "Gymnocladus canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian thornless buckeye, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its smooth, fissured bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into pods containing angular, brown seeds. It is often found in moist soils along streams and in woodlands, and it has a long history of use by Indigenous peoples for its medicinal properties. However, its seeds and leaves contain toxic compounds and should not be consumed."
