    "intro": "Glyceria maritima var. arenaria, commonly known as the beach grass, is a variant of the coastal grass species native to sandy shorelines. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted appearance and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. This plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and estuarine environments. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in coastal habitats. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, contributing to its reproductive success in harsh maritime conditions."
