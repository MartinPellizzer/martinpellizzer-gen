    "intro": "Gynandropsis aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange-flowered gynandropsis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking orange-yellow flowers that bloom in dense, spherical clusters. The plant has a low-growing, succulent habit, with fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Gynandropsis aurantiaca is often used in local traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
