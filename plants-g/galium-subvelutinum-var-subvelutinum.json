    "intro": "Galium subvelutinum var. subvelutinum, commonly known as the silky bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by small, bladder-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and preference for specific habitats make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
