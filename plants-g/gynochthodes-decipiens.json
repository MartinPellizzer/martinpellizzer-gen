It is native to Australia and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for native wildlife. Gynochthodes decipiens is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. Its name reflects its ability to mimic other plants, potentially aiding in its survival through deceptive interactions with pollinators."
