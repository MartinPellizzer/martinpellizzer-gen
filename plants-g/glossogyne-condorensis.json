    "intro": "Glossogyne condorensis, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Glossogyne condorensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
