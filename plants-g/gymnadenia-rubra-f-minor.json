    "intro": "Gymnadenia rubra f. minor, commonly known as the lesser red gentian, is a rare and striking plant belonging to the Gentianaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers, which are typically arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Europe, where it thrives in moist, calcareous grasslands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the stems are erect and robust. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
