It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality and stable wetland environments."
