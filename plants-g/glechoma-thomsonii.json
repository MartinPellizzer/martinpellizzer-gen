    "intro": "Glechoma thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. It spreads through stolons, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Glechoma thomsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, wet conditions."
