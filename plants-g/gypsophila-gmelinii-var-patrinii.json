    "intro": "Gypsophila gmelinii var. patrinii, commonly known as the desert baby's breath, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often hairy stems that produce clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, featuring deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry, well-drained soils."
