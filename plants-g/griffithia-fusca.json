    "intro": "Griffithia fusca, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, primarily pines, and derives some of its nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating. Griffithia fusca plays a role in the ecological dynamics of New Zealand's forests, though it is considered a rare and endangered species."
