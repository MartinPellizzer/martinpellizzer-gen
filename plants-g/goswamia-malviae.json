    "intro": "Goswamia malviae, commonly known as the Malvian starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Western Ghats in India. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and prominent stamens, and it blooms during the monsoon season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Goswamia malviae is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
