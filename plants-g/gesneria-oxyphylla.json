    "intro": "Gesneria oxyphylla, commonly known as the sharp-leaf gesneria, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria oxyphylla is popular among collectors for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
