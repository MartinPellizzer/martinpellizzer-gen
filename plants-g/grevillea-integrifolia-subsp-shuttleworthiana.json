    "intro": "Grevillea integrifolia subsp. shuttleworthiana, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features bright red or orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its coastal habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy plant in coastal environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
