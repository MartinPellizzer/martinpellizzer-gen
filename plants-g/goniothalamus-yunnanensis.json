    "intro": "Goniothalamus yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan yew, is a rare and endangered member of the Annonaceae family native to China. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its smooth, grey bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in cool, moist habitats and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
