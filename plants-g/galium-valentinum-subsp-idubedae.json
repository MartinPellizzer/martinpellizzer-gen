    "intro": "Galium valentinum subsp. idubedae, commonly known as the Valentine\u2019s bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, white to pale pink flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flowering period compared to the typical G. valentinum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in botanical studies."
