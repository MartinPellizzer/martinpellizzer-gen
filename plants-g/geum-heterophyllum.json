    "intro": "Geum heterophyllum, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stem leaves are smaller and more elongated. The plant produces clusters of yellow, five-petaled flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common component of wetland ecosystems."
