It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and mountainous tundras. The plant features upright stems with opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are usually hairy and adapted to cold climates. Its flowers are typically pink or red, with five petals and a distinctive calyx, blooming in late summer.
