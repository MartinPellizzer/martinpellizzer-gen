    "intro": "Gagea pineticola, commonly known as the mountain gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as coniferous forests. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in cooler, forested habitats. Gagea pineticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
