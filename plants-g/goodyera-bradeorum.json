    "intro": "Goodyera bradeorum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly shapes. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its specialized aerial roots for nutrient absorption from the air and rain. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its habitat specificity and threatened status, Goodyera bradeorum is a subject of conservation interest."
