    "intro": "Gentiana pneumonanthe var. boryi, commonly known as the Bory's gentian, is a striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its deep blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of down, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variant is closely related to other gentian species but is distinguished by its unique floral coloration and habitat preferences."
