    "intro": "Gnaphalium tortuanum, commonly known as the woolly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, fluffy appearance due to the presence of fine, white hairs on its leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in the wild."
