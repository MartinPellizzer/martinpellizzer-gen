    "intro": "Guzmania tricolor, commonly known as the rainbow bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that displays red, orange, and yellow hues, creating a striking visual display. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool that supports small aquatic life. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat. Guzmania tricolor thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting mix to prevent root rot."
