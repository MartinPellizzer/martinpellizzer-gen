    "intro": "Grindelia hirsutula var. decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent gumweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its woolly, silver-gray foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
