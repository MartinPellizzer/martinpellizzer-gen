    "intro": "Glycine rhombea, commonly known as the broadleaf cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect, branching stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by flat, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Glycine rhombea is often cultivated for its protein-rich seeds and its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adaptable to various climatic conditions."
