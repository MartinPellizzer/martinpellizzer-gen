    "intro": "Gunnera calthifolia, commonly known as the giant dock, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its enormous, shield-shaped leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, with a textured, waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in late summer, typically in shades of yellow or green, which are borne on tall, stout stalks. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its dramatic foliage. Due to its size and water requirements, it is best suited for wetland or bog garden settings."
