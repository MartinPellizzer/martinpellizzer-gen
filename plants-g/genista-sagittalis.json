It features slender, woody stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are trifoliate, with three lance-shaped leaflets that give the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The plant is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in poor conditions."
