    "intro": "Grimaldia viscosa, commonly known as the sticky germander, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a sticky resin, giving it its common name. Grimaldia viscosa is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
