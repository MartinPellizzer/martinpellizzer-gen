It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with distinctive red or purple spots, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden borders and woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and long flowering period."
