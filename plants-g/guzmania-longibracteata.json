    "intro": "Guzmania longibracteata, commonly known as the longibracteata bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect rainwater, which serves as a microhabitat for various organisms. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, adding visual interest to its foliage. Its leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture, and they often have a subtle sheen that enhances its aesthetic appeal. Guzmania longibracteata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its health and vigor."
