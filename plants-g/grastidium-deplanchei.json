    "intro": "Grastidium deplanchei, commonly known as the Desert Sunflower, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has grey-green, narrow, and slightly hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Grastidium deplanchei is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water availability."
