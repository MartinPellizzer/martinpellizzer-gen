    "intro": "Grammitis enterosoroides, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a velvety texture. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Grammitis enterosoroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
