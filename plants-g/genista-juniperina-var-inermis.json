It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its slender, evergreen stems and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces yellow pea-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and scrublands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
