    "intro": "Gentiana aspera, commonly known as the rough gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, rough hairs, giving it its common name. Gentiana aspera is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
