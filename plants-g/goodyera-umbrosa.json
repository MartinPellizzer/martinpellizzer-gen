    "intro": "Goodyera umbrosa, commonly known as the lady's slipper orchid, is a low-growing epiphytic orchid native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and delicate, spurred flowers. The plant's roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Its flowers, which are typically pale green or yellow, are adapted for pollination by specific insects. Goodyera umbrosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
