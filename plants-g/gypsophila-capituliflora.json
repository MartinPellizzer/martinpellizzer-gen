    "intro": "Gypsophila capituliflora, commonly known as the desert sand flower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and produces clusters of small, delicate white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a soft, ethereal appearance to its harsh environment. Gypsophila capituliflora is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to flourish in challenging landscapes."
