It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds."
