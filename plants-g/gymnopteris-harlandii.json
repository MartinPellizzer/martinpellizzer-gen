It is characterized by its delicate, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are typically light green in color. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or woodland areas. Gymnopteris harlandii has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces spores in small, clustered sori on the underside of its fronds. It is a relatively small fern, with fronds that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length."
