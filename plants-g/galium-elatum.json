    "intro": "Galium elatum, commonly known as bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Galium elatum is found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks across temperate regions. It is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
