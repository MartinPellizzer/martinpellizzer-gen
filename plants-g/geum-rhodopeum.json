    "intro": "Geum rhodopeum, commonly known as the Rhodope avens, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal leaves and showy, pinkish-red flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It produces small, oval fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
