    "intro": "Gilia mucronata, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Gilia mucronata plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
