    "intro": "Glechoma hederacea f. verticillata, commonly known as creeping ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along garden paths. Its creeping habit and ability to spread rapidly make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
