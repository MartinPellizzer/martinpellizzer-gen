    "intro": "Goniopteris venusta, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, velvety fronds. It belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida. The plant features bipinnate leaves with a soft, fuzzy texture that gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
