It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, berry-like fruits that are often consumed by birds and mammals. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, woody fruits that split open when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Grewia sulcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
