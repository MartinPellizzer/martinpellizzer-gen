It features a globular to cylindrical stem with a thick, spiny exterior and a smooth, often brightly colored upper surface. The plant produces yellow flowers during the growing season, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
