It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Glyceria leptostachys thrives in moist environments and is often found in association with other wetland plants. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
