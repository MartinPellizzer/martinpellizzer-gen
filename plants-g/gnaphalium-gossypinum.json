    "intro": "Gnaphalium gossypinum, commonly known as the woolly cudweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to regions of Europe and western Asia, this plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
