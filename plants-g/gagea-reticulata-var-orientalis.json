It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers. The plant has a bulbous base that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
