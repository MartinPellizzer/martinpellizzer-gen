It features small, oval leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature. Grewia setacea is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
