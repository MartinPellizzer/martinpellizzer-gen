    "intro": "Gentiana holdereriana, commonly known as the Holderer's gentian, is a striking perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Gentiana holdereriana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas at high altitudes."
