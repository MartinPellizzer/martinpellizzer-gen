    "intro": "Gymnema montanum var. pubiflorum, commonly known as the Indian nettle or gymnema, is a climbing shrub native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy underside, and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It is often found in moist, shaded forest environments and is valued for its medicinal properties. The leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported ability to reduce sugar absorption."
