    "intro": "Gasteria liliputana, commonly known as the dwarf gasteria, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, star-shaped white or pale yellow flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
