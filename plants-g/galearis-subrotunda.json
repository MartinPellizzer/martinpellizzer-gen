    "intro": "Galearis subrotunda, commonly known as the purple globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Galearis subrotunda is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
