    "intro": "Gaultheria trichophylla var. obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf wintergreen, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a spicy, mint-like flavor, making the plant valuable in both culinary and medicinal contexts. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories."
