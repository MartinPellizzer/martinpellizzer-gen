    "intro": "Gentiana glauca, commonly known as the blue gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
