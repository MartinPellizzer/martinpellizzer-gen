    "intro": "Galatea albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Galatea albiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
