It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in partial to full sun. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The smooth, glabrous stems and leaves distinguish this variety from other galactia species."
