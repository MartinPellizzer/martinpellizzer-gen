    "intro": "Galium strictum, commonly known as bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a distinctive hairy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Galium strictum is also known for its historical use in herbal medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds."
