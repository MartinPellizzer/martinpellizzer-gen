    "intro": "Genista depressa f. pinetorum, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its evergreen foliage. The plant has slender, wiry stems covered in fine, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for coastal or xerophytic gardens. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for beneficial insects."
