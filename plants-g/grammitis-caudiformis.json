    "intro": "Grammitis caudiformis, commonly known as the long-tailed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water in humid environments. Grammitis caudiformis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
