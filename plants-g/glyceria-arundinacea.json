    "intro": "Glyceria arundinacea, commonly known as rivergrass or sweet grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Glyceria arundinacea is adapted to moist environments and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other waterlogged soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
