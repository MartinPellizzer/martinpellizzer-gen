    "intro": "Gonotheca, commonly known as the seed pod of certain flowering plants, is a specialized structure that develops from the ovary after fertilization. It serves as a protective casing for the developing seeds, often containing nutritive tissues that support embryo growth. The shape and structure of the gonotheca can vary widely among species, reflecting adaptations to different environmental conditions. In some plants, it may split open to release seeds, while in others, it remains closed until the seeds are mature. This botanical feature plays a crucial role in the reproductive success of the plant."
