    "intro": "Galeopsis violeti, commonly known as the violet hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, opposite leaves, and small, violet or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Galeopsis violeti is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its botanical significance lies mainly in its ecological role and floral structure."
