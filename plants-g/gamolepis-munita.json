    "intro": "Gamolepis munita, commonly known as the narrowleaf gamolepis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cooler, drier conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Gamolepis munita produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
