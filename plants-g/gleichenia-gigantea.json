    "intro": "Gleichenia gigantea, commonly known as the giant fern, is a large, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a complex rhizome system that allows it to anchor itself to tree trunks and absorb moisture from the air. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Gleichenia gigantea is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the canopy layer."
