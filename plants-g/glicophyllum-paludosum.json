    "intro": "Glicophyllum paludosum, commonly known as the swamp lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It forms a thin, crust-like layer on tree trunks and branches, often found in forested areas with high humidity. The thallus is typically green or yellowish-green, with a distinct, flat structure that allows it to absorb moisture efficiently. It plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution. This lichen is an important component of the ecological balance in wetland and forest ecosystems."
