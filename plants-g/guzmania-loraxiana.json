    "intro": "Guzmania loraxiana, commonly known as the red-tipped guzmania, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that typically features red bracts with yellow-orange flowers. The plant has a rosette-shaped leaf structure that collects rainwater, creating a micro-ecosystem for small organisms. Its leaves are usually dark green with a waxy texture and can grow up to 30 inches in length. Guzmania loraxiana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
