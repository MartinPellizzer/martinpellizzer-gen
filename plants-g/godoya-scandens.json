The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a glossy appearance. Godoya scandens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
