    "intro": "Grevillea trinervis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed honeysuckle, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. These flowers are adapted to attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Grevillea trinervis is well-suited to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas."
