    "intro": "Galeandra graminoides, commonly known as the grassy orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, while its aerial stems bear the showy inflorescences. Galeandra graminoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
