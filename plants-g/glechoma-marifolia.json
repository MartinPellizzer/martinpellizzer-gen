    "intro": "Glechoma marifolia, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Glechoma marifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ability to spread and cover ground effectively."
