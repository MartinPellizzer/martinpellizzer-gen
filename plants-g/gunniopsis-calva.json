    "intro": "Gunniopsis calva, commonly known as the narrowleaf gunniopsis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
