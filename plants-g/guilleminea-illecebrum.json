    "intro": "Guilleminea illecebrum, commonly known as the creeping dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
