    "intro": "Gentiana macgregoryi subsp. macgregoryi, commonly known as the MacGregor's gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which typically bloom in late summer. The plant is perennial and grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often at elevations above 7,000 feet. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations."
