    "intro": "Galium pumilum subsp. asperum, commonly known as rough bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender stems that are often hairy and rough to the touch. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its distinctive texture. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. This subspecies is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
