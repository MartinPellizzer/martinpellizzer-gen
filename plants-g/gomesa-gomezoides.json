    "intro": "Gomesa gomezoides, commonly known as the coastal gomesa, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to saline and wind-prone environments. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion along the coast. Gomesa gomezoides is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
