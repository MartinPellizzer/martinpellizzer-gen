These plants are characterized by their unique, often showy flowers that can resemble ghostly or ethereal forms, hence their common name. Gymnanthelia species are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They possess milky sap and have opposite, simple leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The flowers are usually bisexual, with five petals and a prominent corona, contributing to their striking appearance."
