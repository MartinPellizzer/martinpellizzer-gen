    "intro": "Grammitis taiwanensis, commonly known as Taiwan's spiky fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green and covered with a thin layer of trichomes. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of Taiwan. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Grammitis taiwanensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for small organisms."
