    "intro": "Galium boreale var. medium, commonly known as the northern bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It has slender, often hairy stems that lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval to lance-shaped, and covered with fine hairs. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats."
