    "intro": "Gnaphalium alveolatum, commonly known as the woolly cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grey hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. Its hairy foliage and compact growth habit make it well adapted to withstand environmental stress and competition."
