    "intro": "Gymnocalycium megatae subsp. zecheri, commonly known as the Zecher's moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to northern Argentina. It is characterized by its rounded, globular stems covered in spines and a dense coating of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived. It is a succulent plant adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
