    "intro": "Gahnia rawacensis, commonly known as the Rawacensis tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering stems produce panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Gahnia rawacensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
