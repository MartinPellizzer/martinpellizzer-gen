    "intro": "Gnaphalium dejectum, commonly known as the drooping everlasting flower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow to white florets that are often mistaken for chamomile due to their similar appearance. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its foliage is covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture."
