    "intro": "Galactia parvifolia var. monophylla, commonly known as the small-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange pea-like flowers. The plant is characterized by its unique varietal trait of monophyllous leaves, meaning it has only one leaflet per leaf pair. It is adapted to drought conditions and often grows in sandy or rocky soils. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
