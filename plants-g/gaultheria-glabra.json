    "intro": "Gaultheria glabra, commonly known as the smooth wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features glossy, dark green elliptical leaves that remain dense throughout the year. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and wildlife. Its leaves contain methyl salicylate, giving them a wintergreen scent and making the plant useful in traditional medicine. Gaultheria glabra thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories."
