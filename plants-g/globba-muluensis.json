    "intro": "Globba muluensis, commonly known as the Mulu globba, is a herbaceous plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes ginger and turmeric, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in inflorescences. Globba muluensis is often found in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and biodiversity in tropical regions."
