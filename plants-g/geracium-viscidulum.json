    "intro": "Geracium viscidulum, commonly known as the sticky geranium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the cooler months. Its sticky secretions on the stems and leaves serve as a natural defense mechanism against herbivores. Geracium viscidulum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in conditions with limited water availability."
