    "intro": "Gymnopteris terminans, commonly known as the broad-leafed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching and have a distinctive, lace-like appearance. The plant is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Gymnopteris terminans is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage."
