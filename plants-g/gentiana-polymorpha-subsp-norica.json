    "intro": "Gentiana polymorpha subsp. norica, commonly known as the Alpine gentian, is a perennial herb native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often found in mountain meadows."
