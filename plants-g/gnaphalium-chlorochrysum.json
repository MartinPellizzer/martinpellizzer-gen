    "intro": "Gnaphalium chlorochrysum, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often surrounded by pale green bracts. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gnaphalium chlorochrysum is often found in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
