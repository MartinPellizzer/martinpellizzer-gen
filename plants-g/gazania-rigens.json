It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, daisy-like flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has a low-growing habit with fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Gazania rigens thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its showy blooms attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value."
