It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
