    "intro": "Gagea michaelis, commonly known as the Michael's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Liliaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces small, oval-shaped bulbs that serve as storage organs and aids in its propagation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
