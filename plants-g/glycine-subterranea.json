    "intro": "Glycine subterranea, commonly known as the underground bean, is a perennial legume native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its deep root system and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and pods that contain edible seeds. It is often used in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Its subterranean growth habit makes it unique among leguminous plants."
