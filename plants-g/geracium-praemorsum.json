    "intro": "Geracium praemorsum, commonly known as the death's-head hawkmoth, is a striking plant characterized by its tall, spindly stems and large, showy flowers. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Geracium praemorsum is often found in coastal and cliff habitats, where it withstands strong winds and salt spray."
