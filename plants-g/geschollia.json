    "intro": "Geschollia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically yellow or purple in color. Geschollia is often found in wetland areas and can thrive in moist, sunny environments. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
