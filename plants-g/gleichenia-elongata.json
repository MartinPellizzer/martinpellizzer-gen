    "intro": "Gleichenia elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often arranged in a dense, carpet-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Gleichenia elongata is known for its ability to thrive in humid climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
