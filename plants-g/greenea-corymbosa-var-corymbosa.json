It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant features silvery-gray foliage with finely textured leaves, which help it thrive in dry, rocky environments. It is often found in high-altitude regions and is well adapted to harsh climatic conditions. The flowers are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance."
