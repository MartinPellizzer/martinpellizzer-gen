    "intro": "Goodenia calcarata, commonly known as the rock goodenia, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Goodenia calcarata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
