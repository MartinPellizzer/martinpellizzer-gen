    "intro": "Goodyera cyrtoglossa, commonly known as the helmeted lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a dense, spiral arrangement of flowers that resemble a helmet. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and wetlands. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with a distinctive hood-like structure over the reproductive organs. Goodyera cyrtoglossa is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
