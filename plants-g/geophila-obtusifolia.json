    "intro": "Geophila obtusifolia, commonly known as the bluntleaf bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, often white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, and it has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a blunt or rounded tip, and the plant produces small, clustered inflorescences. Geophila obtusifolia is often used in traditional medicine and as a ground cover in ornamental gardening."
