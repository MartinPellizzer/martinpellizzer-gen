    "intro": "Geranium subcaulescens, commonly known as the slender geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright, slender stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 60 centimeters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to red, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and a slightly hairy surface. Geranium subcaulescens is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
