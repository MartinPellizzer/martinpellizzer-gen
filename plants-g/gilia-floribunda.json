    "intro": "Gilia floribunda, commonly known as desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Gilia floribunda plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitats."
