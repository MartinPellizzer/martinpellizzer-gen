It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating, while its stems are usually unbranched and upright. The flowers feature prominent yellow spots on the petals, which give the plant its common name."
