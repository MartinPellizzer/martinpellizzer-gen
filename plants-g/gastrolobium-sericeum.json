    "intro": "Gastrolobium sericeum, commonly known as the silky hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a silky appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spikes. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands. Gastrolobium sericeum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
