    "intro": "Gothofreda minarum, commonly known as the moonlight lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its blooming period occurs during the late summer months, coinciding with the full moon. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is considered a flagship species for conservation efforts in its native habitat."
