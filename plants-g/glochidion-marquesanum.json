    "intro": "Glochidion marquesanum, commonly known as the Marquesan glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly the Marquesas Islands. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
