    "intro": "Guzmania squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly flame plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky inflorescence that resembles a flame, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant features a rosette of long, narrow, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. Its foliage is often covered in a soft, woolly coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. Guzmania squarrosa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
