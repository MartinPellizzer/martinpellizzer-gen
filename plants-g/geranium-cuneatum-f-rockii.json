    "intro": "Geranium cuneatum f. rockii, commonly known as the Rocky Mountain geranium, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features upright, hairy stems that bear pairs of opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled pink to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
