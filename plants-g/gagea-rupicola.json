    "intro": "Gagea rupicola, commonly known as the rock gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered bulbs and delicate, grass-like leaves. The plant produces umbels of white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are often fragrant. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
