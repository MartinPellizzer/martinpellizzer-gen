    "intro": "Galium oresbium, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Galium oresbium thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
