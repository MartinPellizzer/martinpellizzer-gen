    "intro": "Gagea iberica var. lacaitae, commonly known as the Iberian spring beauty, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
