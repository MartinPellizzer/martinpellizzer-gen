    "intro": "Goniopteris macropus, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a prehistoric plant that thrived during the Carboniferous and Permian periods. It is characterized by its large, frond-like structures that resemble modern-day ferns, though it is not a true fern. The plant had a complex vascular system, allowing it to grow tall and support its massive fronds. Its leaves were often divided into segments, and it reproduced via spores rather than seeds. This plant played a significant role in the ancient ecosystems, contributing to the formation of coal deposits."
