    "intro": "Geonoma lehmannii subsp. corrugata, commonly known as the corrugated geonoma, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a terrestrial bromeliad characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically narrow and have a distinctive corrugated texture, which gives the species its subspecific name. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Colombia. This plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories."
