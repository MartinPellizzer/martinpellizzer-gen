    "intro": "Genista monosperma var. rigidula, commonly known as the rigid shrub vetch, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woody growth and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control."
