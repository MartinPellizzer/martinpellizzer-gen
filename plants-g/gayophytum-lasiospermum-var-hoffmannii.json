    "intro": "Gayophytum lasiospermum var. hoffmannii, commonly known as the Hoffmann's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with translucent, waxy leaves and elongated, pale pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
