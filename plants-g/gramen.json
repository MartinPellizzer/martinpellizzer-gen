    "intro": "Gramen, commonly known as the grass family, is a large and diverse group of flowering plants that includes over 10,000 species. These plants are characterized by their narrow, elongated leaves and hollow or solid cylindrical stems. Gramen species are typically herbaceous, meaning they lack woody stems, and they often grow in dense mats or tufts. They play a crucial role in ecosystems as a primary food source for grazing animals and as a component of many habitats. Gramen is also widely cultivated for agricultural purposes, such as in the production of forage and biofuels."
