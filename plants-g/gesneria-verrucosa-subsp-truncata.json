    "intro": "Gesneria verrucosa subsp. truncata, commonly known as the Truncata Gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features broad, ovate leaves with a waxy texture and a distinctive truncate (notched) base, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
