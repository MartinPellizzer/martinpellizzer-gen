    "intro": "Geonoma schottiana var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf geonoma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps in collecting moisture from the humid environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne on short pedicels. This variety is often found in shaded, moist forest understories where it thrives in the nutrient-rich soil of the rainforest floor."
