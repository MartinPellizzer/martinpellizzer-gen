    "intro": "Geodorum nutans, commonly known as the nodding lady's-tongue, is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its striking, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that resemble a lady's tongue. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial herb, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, with a smooth, waxy surface. The orchid produces small, greenish-yellow berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
