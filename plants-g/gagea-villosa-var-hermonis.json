    "intro": "Gagea villosa var. hermonis, commonly known as the Hermon gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained, rocky soils at elevations ranging from 6,000 to 10,000 feet. Its bulbs are covered in a fibrous, hairy layer, which helps in water retention and protection against harsh environmental conditions. This variety is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
