    "intro": "Gamochaeta chamissonis, commonly known as the coast goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Gamochaeta chamissonis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
