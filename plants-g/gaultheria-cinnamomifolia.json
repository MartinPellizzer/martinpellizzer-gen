    "intro": "Gaultheria cinnamomifolia, commonly known as the cinnamon leaf wintergreen, is a species of shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, glossy evergreen leaves that emit a strong cinnamon-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Gaultheria cinnamomifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued for both its ornamental and medicinal qualities."
