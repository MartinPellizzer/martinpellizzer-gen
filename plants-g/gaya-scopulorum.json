    "intro": "Gaya scopulorum, commonly known as the rock cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically hidden within its foliage. Gaya scopulorum is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded, humid environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
