    "intro": "Grammitis meridionalis, commonly known as the southern grammitis, is a fern native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which is a common feature among ferns. Grammitis meridionalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
