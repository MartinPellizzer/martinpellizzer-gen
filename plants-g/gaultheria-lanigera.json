    "intro": "Gaultheria lanigera, commonly known as the woolly wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, glandular-hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Gaultheria lanigera is also valued for its aromatic leaves, which contain compounds used in traditional medicine."
