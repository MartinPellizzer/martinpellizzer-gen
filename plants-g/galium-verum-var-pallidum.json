    "intro": "Galium verum var. pallidum, commonly known as yellow bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, and it often forms dense mats in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly found in woodland areas, along stream banks, and in meadows. The species is notable for its historical use in herbal medicine and as a dye source."
