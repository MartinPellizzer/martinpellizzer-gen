    "intro": "Gagea divaricata, commonly known as the western nodding iris, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the western United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, nodding flowers in shades of blue or purple. The plant typically blooms in early spring and is often found in moist, shaded woodland habitats. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in harsh environments, allowing it to persist through dry periods. Gagea divaricata plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for early pollinators."
