    "intro": "Globulea pubescens var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping globulea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that trail along the ground and produce clusters of small, white, globular flowers. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
