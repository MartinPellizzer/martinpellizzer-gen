    "intro": "Gilberta, commonly known as the \"flower of the desert,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Gilberta species are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plants typically grow from a basal rosette and produce small, inconspicuous fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to their drought tolerance, they are often used in xeriscaping and as ornamental plants in dry climates."
