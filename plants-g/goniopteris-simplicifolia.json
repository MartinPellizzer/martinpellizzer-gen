    "intro": "Goniopteris simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its large, delicate fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, fan-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in wetland habitats."
