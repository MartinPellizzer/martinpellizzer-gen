    "intro": "Gnaphalium cinereum, commonly known as silverleaf cottonweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, fluffy clusters, giving it a cotton-like appearance. Its leaves are narrow, silver-gray, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Gnaphalium cinereum is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, sun-exposed conditions."
