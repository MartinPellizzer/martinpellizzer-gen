    "intro": "Gnaphalium affine var. parvulum, commonly known as the smallflower everlasting, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of tiny, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and linear, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open areas such as meadows and slopes. Its fibrous roots and compact growth form make it well-suited for arid environments."
