    "intro": "Gaura micrantha, commonly known as smallflower gaura, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, zigzagging stems that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a soft, feathery appearance. Gaura micrantha is well-suited for gardens with full sun and well-drained soil, and it is often used in native plant landscapes for its ornamental value."
