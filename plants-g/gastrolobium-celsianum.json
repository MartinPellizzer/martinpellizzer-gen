It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer to autumn, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Gastrolobium celsianum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
