    "intro": "Gentiana coronata, commonly known as the crown gentian, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant grows up to 30\u201360 cm tall, with lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in woodland or alpine habitats. The genus Gentiana is known for its showy, spurred flowers, and G. coronata is no exception, making it a notable species in botanical gardens and natural landscapes."
