    "intro": "Gnephosis intonsa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring a single, slender stem with no leaves, relying entirely on its roots for nutrient absorption. It is an epiphytic orchid, growing on the trunks of trees rather than in soil. Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, Gnephosis intonsa is considered a critically endangered species."
