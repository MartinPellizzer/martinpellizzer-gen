    "intro": "Grewia disticha, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red gum tree, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often reddish or purplish in color, especially when young. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, round, orange to red fruits. The fruits are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor, making them popular in local cuisines. Grewia disticha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
