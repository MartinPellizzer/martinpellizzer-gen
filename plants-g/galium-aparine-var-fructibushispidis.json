    "intro": "Galium aparine var. fructibushispidis, commonly known as sticky willow herb, is a variant of the common bedstraw species. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of hooked hairs on the stems and leaves, which aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
