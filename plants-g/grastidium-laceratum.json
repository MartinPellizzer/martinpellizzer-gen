    "intro": "Grastidium laceratum, commonly known as the fringed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features linear, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Grastidium laceratum is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts."
