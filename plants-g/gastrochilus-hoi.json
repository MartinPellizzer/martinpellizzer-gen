    "intro": "Gastrochilus hoi, commonly known as the Hainan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive coloration, typically in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gastrochilus hoi is considered a conservation concern."
