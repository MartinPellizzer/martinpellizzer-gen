    "intro": "Gleichenia longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Gleichenia longipes is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, well-drained soil."
