    "intro": "Gentilia, commonly known as the gentian, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gentianaceae. These plants are characterized by their striking blue or purple flowers, which are typically tubular in shape and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gentilia species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. They often grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The flowers are usually short-lived, blooming for a brief period during the summer months."
