    "intro": "Gunnera sanctae-marthae, commonly known as the giant water shield, is a striking perennial plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, providing a dramatic visual impact. The plant thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in regions with high humidity and abundant rainfall. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps repel water, a feature adapted to its aquatic habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in dense clusters, which are pollinated by insects and birds."
