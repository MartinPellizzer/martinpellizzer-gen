    "intro": "Galium aparine var. infestum, commonly known as common bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, prostrate stems that are covered in tiny, hooked hairs, which aid in seed dispersal. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy surface. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in woodland edges, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments."
