    "intro": "Grammitis furcata, commonly known as the forked fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Grammitis furcata is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic."
