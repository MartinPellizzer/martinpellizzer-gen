    "intro": "Gajati, commonly known as the Indian nettle or *Urena lobata*, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Gajati is also known for its ability to grow rapidly, making it both a weed and a useful plant in certain ecological contexts."
