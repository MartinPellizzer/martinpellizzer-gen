    "intro": "Goniopteris faucia, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive fan-like shape and a central vein. Goniopteris faucia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for aquatic organisms."
