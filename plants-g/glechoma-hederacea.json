    "intro": "Glechoma hederacea, commonly known as ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers. The plant spreads rapidly through stolons, forming dense mats that can colonize lawns and gardens. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit. Botanically, it belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and medicinal properties."
