    "intro": "Gamochaeta stagnalis, commonly known as the marsh sandwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense heads. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its moist habitat. Gamochaeta stagnalis plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas and is often found in regions with high humidity and poor drainage."
