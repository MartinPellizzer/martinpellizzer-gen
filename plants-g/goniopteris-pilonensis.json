    "intro": "Goniopteris pilonensis, commonly known as the Pilonense Kidney Fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, kidney-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique trait makes it a rare and fascinating example of botanical adaptation in the plant kingdom."
