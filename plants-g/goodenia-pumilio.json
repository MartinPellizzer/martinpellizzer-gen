    "intro": "Goodenia pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf goodenia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Australia. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with small, clustered leaves and delicate, pale blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Goodenia pumilio is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
