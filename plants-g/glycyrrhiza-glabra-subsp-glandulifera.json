    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza glabra subsp. glandulifera, commonly known as the European licorice, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems, alternate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces elongated, woody pods containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found near water bodies. This subspecies is closely related to the more widely cultivated Glycyrrhiza glabra, but it is less commonly used in commercial licorice production."
