    "intro": "Goniophlebium confluens, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Goniophlebium confluens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
