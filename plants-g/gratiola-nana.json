    "intro": "Gratiola nana, commonly known as dwarf yellow root, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It typically reaches heights of only a few inches, with slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, and the roots are yellow and have a distinctive, aromatic scent. Gratiola nana is often found in moist, sandy soils in open woods or along stream banks."
