    "intro": "Gentiana wilsonii subsp. wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's gentian, is a striking perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its vivid blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and are typically clustered in racemes. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
