It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
