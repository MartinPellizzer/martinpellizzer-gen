    "intro": "Gymnosporia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy gymnosporia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces cone-like structures that contain its seeds, typical of gymnosperms. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas."
