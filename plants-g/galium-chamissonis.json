    "intro": "Galium chamissonis, commonly known as creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and clusters of white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
