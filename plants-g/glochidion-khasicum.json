It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
