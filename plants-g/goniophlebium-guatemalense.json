    "intro": "Goniophlebium guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is fibrous and serves as the main storage organ for nutrients. Goniophlebium guatemalense plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
