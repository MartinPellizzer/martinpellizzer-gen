    "intro": "Gaultheria purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-flowered wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, high-altitude habitat. Gaultheria purpurascens is also noted for its aromatic leaves, which emit a sharp, mint-like scent when crushed."
