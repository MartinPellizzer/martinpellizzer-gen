It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and humid conditions. Its woody stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in coastal environments."
