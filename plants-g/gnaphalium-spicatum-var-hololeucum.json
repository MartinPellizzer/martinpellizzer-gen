It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, white to pale yellow flower heads. This variant is distinguished by its entirely white flowers, as opposed to the more common greenish or yellowish hues in other varieties. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant is often found in temperate regions of Europe and is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
