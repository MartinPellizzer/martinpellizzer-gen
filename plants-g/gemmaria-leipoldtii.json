    "intro": "Gemmaria leipoldtii, commonly known as the Leipoldt's gemmaria, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with dense, leathery foliage that is often a deep green color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers during the winter months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for coastal gardens."
