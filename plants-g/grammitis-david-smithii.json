    "intro": "Grammitis david-smithii, commonly known as the David-Smith's filmy fern, is a rare and delicate species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, almost translucent leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
