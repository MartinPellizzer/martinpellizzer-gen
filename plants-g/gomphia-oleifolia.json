    "intro": "Gomphia oleifolia, commonly known as the oil fern, is a species of aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its dense, floating fronds that form a mat on the water surface. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Gomphia oleifolia thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its presence often indicates good water quality and is sometimes used as an indicator species in ecological assessments."
