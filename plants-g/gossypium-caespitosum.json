    "intro": "Gossypium caespitosum, commonly known as the rough cotton or desert cotton, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woolly, hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its cotton-like fibers, though not typically used for commercial cotton production, have been historically used by indigenous peoples for various purposes. Gossypium caespitosum is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
