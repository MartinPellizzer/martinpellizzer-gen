    "intro": "Gastrochilus fargesii, commonly known as the Sichuan orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale green or white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on the trunks of trees or cliffs. Its botanical features include thin, leathery leaves and a compact, herbaceous growth habit. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
