    "intro": "Gynopachis pulcherrima, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in many areas. The flowers bloom throughout the growing season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
