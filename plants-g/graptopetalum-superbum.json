It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
