    "intro": "Gouldia antiqua, commonly known as the ancient gouldia, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a sought-after species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts. Due to its endangered status, cultivation and propagation are essential for its survival."
