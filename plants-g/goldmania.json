    "intro": "Goldmania, commonly known as the golden starflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals that resemble small stars, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates and well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of hair. Goldmania is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its potential medicinal properties."
