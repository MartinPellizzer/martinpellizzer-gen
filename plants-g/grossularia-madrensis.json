    "intro": "Grossularia madrensis, commonly known as the Mexican mountain currant, is a species of shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its small, bright red berries that are edible. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine pubescence, while its flowers are white or pale pink and clustered in racemes. Grossularia madrensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in traditional medicine."
