    "intro": "Gleichenia rupestris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant thrives in rocky soils and can often be found on limestone or sandstone outcrops. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Gleichenia rupestris is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
