    "intro": "Greigia vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic greigia, is a rare and unique plant species native to the volcanic regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its striking, umbrella-like inflorescence. The plant thrives in nutrient-rich volcanic soil and has adapted to high-altitude environments with extreme temperature fluctuations. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its flowers are typically white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Greigia vulcanica is considered a vulnerable species."
