    "intro": "Gaertnera coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved gaertnera, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense, rough texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It is often found growing in rocky or mountainous areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Gaertnera coriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
