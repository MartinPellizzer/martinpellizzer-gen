    "intro": "Geranium sylvestre, commonly known as woodland geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in woodland areas, along stream banks, and in moist meadows, preferring partial to full shade. The plant features upright stems that bear clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough texture and a slightly hairy surface. Geranium sylvestre is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
