    "intro": "Gesneria pachyclada, commonly known as the thick-stemmed gesneria, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. It is a popular houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements. Gesneria pachyclada prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
