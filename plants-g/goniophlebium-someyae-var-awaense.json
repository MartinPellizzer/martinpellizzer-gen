    "intro": "Goniophlebium someyae var. awaense, commonly known as the Awa fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in montane forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
