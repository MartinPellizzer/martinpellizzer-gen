The plant produces vibrant red bracts that surround its small, white flowers, creating a dramatic visual display. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. This species is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
