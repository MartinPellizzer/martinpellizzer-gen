    "intro": "Galium \u00d7 pomeranicum, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a hybrid perennial plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a common sight in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia."
