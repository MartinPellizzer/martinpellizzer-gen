    "intro": "Gynura cavaleriei, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Chinese velvetleaf, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, often blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Gynura cavaleriei thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions."
