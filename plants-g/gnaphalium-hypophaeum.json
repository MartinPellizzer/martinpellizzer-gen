    "intro": "Gnaphalium hypophaeum, commonly known as the narrowleaf everlasting, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flower heads, which are surrounded by bracts that give the plant a fluffy appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, often in temperate regions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a soft, hairy texture, and it is known for its ability to retain its color and form when dried. Gnaphalium hypophaeum is also noted for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
