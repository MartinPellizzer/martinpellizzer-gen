    "intro": "Gatyona leiocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruit cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the Philippines and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically dioecious, with separate male and female plants. Its most distinctive feature is the pale, fleshy seed capsule, which contains a single, large seed. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Gatyona leiocarpa is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research."
