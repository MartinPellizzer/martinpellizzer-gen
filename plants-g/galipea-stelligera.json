    "intro": "Galipea stelligera, commonly known as the rock almond, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Galipea stelligera typically grows on rocky slopes and coastal bluffs, where it forms dense thickets. It is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
