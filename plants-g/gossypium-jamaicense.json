    "intro": "Gossypium jamaicense, commonly known as Jamaican cotton, is a species of wild cotton native to the Caribbean islands. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces fluffy, white fibers that are encased in a boll, similar to other cotton species. It typically thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest in cotton breeding programs for improving fiber quality and resistance to pests."
