    "intro": "Geranium polyanthes, commonly known as the clustered geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and features rounded, palmately lobed leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring through early summer."
