    "intro": "Gomphandra polymorpha var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved gomphandra, is a rare and lesser-known species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often found in shaded, humid environments. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
