    "intro": "Gentianella albanica, commonly known as the Albanian gentian, is a perennial herb native to the Balkans, particularly Albania. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
