    "intro": "Geonoma molinillo, commonly known as the \"molinillo fern,\" is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that often have a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
