    "intro": "Gothofreda densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered ghost fern, is a unique member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, compact fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
