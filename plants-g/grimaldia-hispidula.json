    "intro": "Grimaldia hispidula, commonly known as the hairy grimaldia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, and the leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. Grimaldia hispidula is often used in native plant gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
