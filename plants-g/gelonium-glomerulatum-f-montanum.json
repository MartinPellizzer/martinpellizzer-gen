    "intro": "[WRONG START] Gelonia glomerulatum f. montanum, commonly known as the mountain gelonia, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a striking visual contrast to its flowering display. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often thriving in full sun conditions. This succulent is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in arid environments."
