    "intro": "Glossorhyncha pullei, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Glossorhyncha pullei is typically found in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
