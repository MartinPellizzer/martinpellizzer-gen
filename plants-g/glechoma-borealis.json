    "intro": "Glechoma borealis, commonly known as northern ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, pale blue or violet flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its creeping growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion. Glechoma borealis is characterized by its aromatic leaves and is often found in temperate climates."
