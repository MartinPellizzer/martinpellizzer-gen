    "intro": "Gesneria calcicola, commonly known as the limestone gesneria, is a rare and unique plant native to the limestone regions of southern China. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with dark green, waxy leaves that have a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Gesneria calcicola thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and somewhat elusive species in the botanical world."
