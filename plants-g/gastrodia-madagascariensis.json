    "intro": "Gastrodia madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascan thunderbolt, is an orchid species native to Madagascar. It is a unique plant that lacks true leaves and instead relies on its underground tubers for photosynthesis. The plant produces a distinctive, spicy aroma, which is believed to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
