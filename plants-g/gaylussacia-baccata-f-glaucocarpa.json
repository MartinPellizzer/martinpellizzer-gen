    "intro": "Gaylussacia baccata f. glaucocarpa, commonly known as the glaucous cranberry bush, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It is a naturally occurring form of Gaylussacia baccata, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that often has a bluish-white waxy coating, giving it a distinctive glaucous appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not as commonly consumed as other cranberry species. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
