    "intro": "Gentiana purpurea var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf gentian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vivid color and unique floral structure."
