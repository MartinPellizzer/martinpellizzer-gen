    "intro": "Gymnosphaera dinagatensis, commonly known as the Dinagat cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Gymnosphaera dinagatensis is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is found primarily on the island of Dinagat. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
