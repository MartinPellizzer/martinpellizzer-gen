    "intro": "Gagea reticularis, commonly known as the netted gagea, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and mountainous regions. Its bulbs are covered in a net-like pattern, giving it its common name and contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Gagea reticularis is often found in association with other spring-flowering plants in its native habitat."
