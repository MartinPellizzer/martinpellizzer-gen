    "intro": "Geissanthus serrulatus, commonly known as the serrated geissanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form with dense, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
