    "intro": "Gynerium levyi, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety hair, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Gynerium levyi is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, making it an invasive species in some regions."
