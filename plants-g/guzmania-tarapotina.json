    "intro": "Guzmania tarapotina, commonly known as the Andean flame plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange inflorescence, which contrasts beautifully with its dark green foliage. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rosette-shaped leaves collect water, creating a microhabitat for small aquatic organisms. Guzmania tarapotina is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and visual appeal."
