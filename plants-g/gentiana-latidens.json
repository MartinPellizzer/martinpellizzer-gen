It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy surface, while its stems are erect and branched. The flowers are tubular with five lobes and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and butterflies."
