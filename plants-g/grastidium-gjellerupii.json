    "intro": "Grastidium gjellerupii, commonly known as the Gjellerup's ghostplant, is a rare and elusive moss species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in extremely cold, moist environments, often found on rocky substrates or in peat bogs. The plant has a delicate, creeping growth habit with slender stems and small, translucent leaves. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, consisting of sporophytes that are typically hidden beneath the leafy shoots. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Grastidium gjellerupii is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental change."
