It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stem is erect and branched. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, aiding in its propagation."
