It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of spikelets that give it its common name. Its inflorescence is cylindrical and often appears as a spike, which is characteristic of the genus Glyceria. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
