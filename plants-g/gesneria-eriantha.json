It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria eriantha is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
