    "intro": "Gypsophila fastigiata subsp. collina, commonly known as the mountain gypsophila, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, delicate white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its charming, daisy-like appearance."
