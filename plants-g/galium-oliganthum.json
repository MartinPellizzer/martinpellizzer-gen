    "intro": "Galium oliganthum, commonly known as the small-stemmed bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually oval to lance-shaped with smooth or slightly hairy surfaces. Its flowers are tiny, white, and clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer. Galium oliganthum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
