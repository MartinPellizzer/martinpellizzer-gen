It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils and is found in various habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The species is also noted for producing a pungent odor, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
