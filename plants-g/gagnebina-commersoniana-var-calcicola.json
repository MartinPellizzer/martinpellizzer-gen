    "intro": "Gagnebina commersoniana var. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola variant of the genus Gagnebina, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is adapted to grow in limestone soils, which contribute to its common name. The plant features small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss, a key adaptation to its harsh environment. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and morphological characteristics."
