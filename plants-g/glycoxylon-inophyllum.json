    "intro": "Glycoxylon inophyllum, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a rare and unique plant found in specific tropical regions. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, woody structure that resembles a cross between a tree and a shrub. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the dry season. Its leaves are alternate and have a velvety texture, while its roots are adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study."
