It features a dense, compact growth habit with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact form and prolonged flowering period."
