    "intro": "Galeola gracilis, commonly known as the slender galea, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
