    "intro": "Galium sylvestre var. glabrum, commonly known as wood spindle or lesser bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that often branch near the base, and its opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, two-valved capsule that releases tiny seeds. Galium sylvestre var. glabrum is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its medicinal and ecological significance."
