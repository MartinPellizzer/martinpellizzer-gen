    "intro": "Glycine rosea, commonly known as the pink bean plant, is a leguminous species native to South America. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically pink to purple in color. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Glycine rosea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
