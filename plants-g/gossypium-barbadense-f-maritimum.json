    "intro": "Gossypium barbadense f. maritimum, commonly known as the sea cotton, is a rare and specialized variety of cotton native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its salt-tolerant nature, allowing it to thrive in saline environments where other cotton species cannot. The plant produces fluffy, white fibers that are similar to those of regular cotton but are adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, reducing water loss in coastal climates. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its unique adaptations and potential for developing salt-resistant crop varieties."
