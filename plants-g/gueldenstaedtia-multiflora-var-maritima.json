It features upright, slender stems that bear clusters of small, blue-violet flowers. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy and adapted to saline environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. Its ability to tolerate coastal conditions makes it an important species in stabilizing shoreline ecosystems."
