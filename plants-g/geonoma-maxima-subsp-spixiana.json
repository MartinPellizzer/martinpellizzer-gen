    "intro": "Geonoma maxima subsp. spixiana, commonly known as the Spix's giant bromeliad, is a large epiphytic plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding structure known as a tank. The plant produces striking inflorescences with red bracts and yellow-orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found on tree trunks or branches in the understory of tropical forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of significant interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
