    "intro": "Geranium nivale, commonly known as the snow geranium, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, adapting to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually rounded and hairy, helping to retain moisture in harsh conditions. Geranium nivale is often found in rocky soils and is a common sight in mountain meadows."
