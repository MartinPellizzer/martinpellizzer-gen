    "intro": "Gentianella albidocoerulea, commonly known as the white-blue gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue and white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its flowers are tubular with five lobes, and they attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
