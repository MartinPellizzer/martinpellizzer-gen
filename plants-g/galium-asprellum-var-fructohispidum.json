    "intro": "Galium asprellum var. fructohispidum, commonly known as the hispid-fruited bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, ascending stems that are often covered with fine, stiff hairs. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom in early summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
