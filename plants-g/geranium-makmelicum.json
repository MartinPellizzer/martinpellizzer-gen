    "intro": "Geranium makmelicum, commonly known as Persian geranium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Geranium makmelicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant."
