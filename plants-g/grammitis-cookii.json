    "intro": "Grammitis cookii, commonly known as Cook's gametophyte, is a fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, finely divided leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, water-repellent scales. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the leaf axils, and it relies on spores for propagation. Grammitis cookii is often found in humid, shaded environments where it can thrive without direct sunlight."
