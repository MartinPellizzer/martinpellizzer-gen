    "intro": "Guatteria slateri, commonly known as the Slater's guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Annonaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain several seeds, and the plant is often found growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
