It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and striking floral display make it a popular choice for both ornamental and low-maintenance gardening."
