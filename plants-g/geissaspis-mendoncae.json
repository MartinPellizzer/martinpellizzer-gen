It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a humid, temperate climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
