    "intro": "Gymnocalycium eurypleurum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived. Gymnocalycium eurypleurum is a succulent plant, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in arid environments. It is well adapted to full sun and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
