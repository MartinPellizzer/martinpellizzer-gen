    "intro": "Guzmania, commonly known as the flame plant or silver sword, is a type of bromeliad native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting bracts that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often resembling flowers. The plant has a rosette-shaped leaf structure that holds water, creating a microhabitat for small insects and amphibians. Guzmania thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. It is popular as a houseplant due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
