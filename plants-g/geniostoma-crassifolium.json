    "intro": "Geniostoma crassifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf geniostoma, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, thick, and leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
