    "intro": "Gleichenia dichotoma var. malayana, commonly known as the Malay spleenwort, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like fronds that are often divided into two distinct sections, giving it a dichotomous branching pattern. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. The varietal form malayana is distinguished by specific morphological traits that set it apart from other varieties of Gleichenia dichotoma."
