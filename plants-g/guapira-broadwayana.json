    "intro": "Guapira broadwayana, commonly known as the broadwayana guapira, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features oval, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, often with a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its compact size and seasonal floral display."
