    "intro": "Genista supranubia, commonly known as the cloud alpine broom, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions. Its small yellow flowers bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
