    "intro": "Gilia sinistra subsp. pinnatisecta, commonly known as the lefty gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, pinnatisect leaves that give it a finely divided appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This subspecies is notable for its unique floral structure and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
