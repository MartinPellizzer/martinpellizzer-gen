    "intro": "Gesneria elongata var. fruticosa, commonly known as the Shrub Gesneria, is a compact, shrub-like member of the Gesneriaceae family native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
