It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive, waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
