    "intro": "Gesneria viridiflora subsp. sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenis's green-flowered gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features broad, dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers in shades of green and yellow, which bloom during the warm season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its unique foliage and vibrant flowers make it a valuable addition to botanical collections and gardens."
