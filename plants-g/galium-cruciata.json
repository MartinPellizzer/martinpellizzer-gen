    "intro": "Galium cruciata, commonly known as the cross-leaf bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, sprawling stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are often adorned with four distinct leaf-like structures that resemble a cross, giving it its common name. Galium cruciata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
