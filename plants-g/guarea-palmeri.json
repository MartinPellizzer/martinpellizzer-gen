    "intro": "Guarea palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's guarea, is a tropical tree native to Central America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found in lowland rainforests. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood, though it is not as widely traded as other members of its family."
