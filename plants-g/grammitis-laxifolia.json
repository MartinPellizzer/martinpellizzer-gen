    "intro": "Grammitis laxifolia, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often hang from tree branches. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread along substrates. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a soft, velvety texture. Grammitis laxifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
