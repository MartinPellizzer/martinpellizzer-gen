    "intro": "Genista tridens subsp. juniperina, commonly known as the Juniperleaf broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that resemble those of juniper, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
