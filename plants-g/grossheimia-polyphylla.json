    "intro": "Grossheimia polyphylla, commonly known as the Tibetan snowbell, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features a compact rosette of broad, fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a notable species in alpine botany."
