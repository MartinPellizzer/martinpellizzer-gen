    "intro": "Gastrosiphon karkarensis, commonly known as the Karkar Island sea holly, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet ray florets and yellow disk flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to saline and coastal environments. It typically grows in low vegetation along the shoreline, where it is exposed to strong winds and tidal influences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
