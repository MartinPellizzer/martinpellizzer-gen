    "intro": "Goniophlebium arcuatum, commonly known as the arcuate liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thallus-like structure that forms dense, mat-like growths on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, often found on rock surfaces or in forest floors with high humidity. Its leaves are arranged in a distinctive arcuate pattern, giving it its scientific name. Goniophlebium arcuatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
