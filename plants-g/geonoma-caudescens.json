    "intro": "Geonoma caudescens, commonly known as the long-tailed fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces spores on the underside of its fronds rather than flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
