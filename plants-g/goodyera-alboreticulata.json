    "intro": "Goodyera alboreticulata, commonly known as the white-veined maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, glossy leaves with intricate, white-veined patterns. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps it anchor to its substrate. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
