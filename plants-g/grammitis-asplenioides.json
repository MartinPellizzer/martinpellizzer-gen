    "intro": "Grammitis asplenioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hart's tongue fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a distinctive, strap-like frond that is typically narrow and elongated, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors. Grammitis asplenioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in shaded garden settings."
