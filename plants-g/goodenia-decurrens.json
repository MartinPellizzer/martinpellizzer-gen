    "intro": "Goodenia decurrens, commonly known as the spreading goodenia, is a perennial herb native to Australia. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its slender, decumbent stems that often spread along the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in spikes. Its leaves are linear and often have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments. Goodenia decurrens is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry shrublands."
