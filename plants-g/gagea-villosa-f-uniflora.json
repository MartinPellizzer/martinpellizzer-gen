    "intro": "Gagea villosa f. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered wood onion, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, upright flower stalk. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. Its bulbs are often used in traditional herbal medicine, though it is not as widely cultivated as other members of its family. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
