It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, making it a popular ornamental species. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a leathery texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to well-drained soils. Guettarda ioensis is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
