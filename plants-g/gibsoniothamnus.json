    "intro": "Gibsoniothamnus, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, inconspicuous blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Gibsoniothamnus thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand coastal conditions such as salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
