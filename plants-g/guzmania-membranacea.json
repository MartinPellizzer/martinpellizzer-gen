    "intro": "Guzmania membranacea, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup that collects rainwater. The plant produces a tall flower spike with colorful bracts, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which can last for several months. Its ability to thrive in low-light conditions makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening. The plant's unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements contribute to its appeal among plant enthusiasts."
