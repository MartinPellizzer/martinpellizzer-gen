It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan and the Tian Shan mountains. The plant produces delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers with a greenish spathe, typically blooming in early spring. It prefers well-drained, calcareous soils and partial shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and the graceful appearance of its flowers."
