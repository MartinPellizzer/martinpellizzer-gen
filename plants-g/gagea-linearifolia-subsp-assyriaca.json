    "intro": "Gagea linearifolia subsp. assyriaca, commonly known as the Assyrian spring crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, spurred flowers that are typically pale blue or purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the floral diversity of the landscape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
