    "intro": "Gymnanthus, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. Gymnanthus species are characterized by their showy, bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. The leaves are typically opposite and simple, with a smooth texture and a lance-shaped or ovate form. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant floral display and ability to thrive in warm climates."
