    "intro": "Gleichenella, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. Gleichenella species are characterized by their creeping rhizomes and pinnate fronds with a distinctive, often hairy appearance. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps them retain moisture in arid conditions. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in their native habitats."
