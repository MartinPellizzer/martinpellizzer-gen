    "intro": "Gymnogramma schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds that are typically 10 to 30 centimeters in length. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clustered, small, and often hairy leaves. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle. Gymnogramma schaffneri thrives in shaded, moist environments, making it a common sight in tropical rainforests."
