It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences. The plant is known for its fine, silvery-white hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, almost sparkling appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
