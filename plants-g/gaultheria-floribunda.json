    "intro": "Gaultheria floribunda, commonly known as the white-flowered wintergreen, is a flowering shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring. The plant is part of the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving species, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Gaultheria floribunda is also valued for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its ornamental appeal makes it a popular choice for gardens in cooler climates."
