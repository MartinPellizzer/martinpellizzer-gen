It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom during the summer months. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Its hairy leaves and stems distinguish it from other similar species within the genus."
