It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant has hairy, rough-textured leaves that give it its common name, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, round berries that contain the seeds. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
