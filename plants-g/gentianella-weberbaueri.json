    "intro": "Gentianella weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. It has lance-shaped leaves and a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
