    "intro": "Gymnosporia wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's thorn, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its leaves are usually small and opposite. Gymnosporia wightiana has a woody stem with thorny branches, which helps it to survive in harsh conditions. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange aril, which is a characteristic feature of the genus."
