    "intro": "Glossostephanus, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Glossostephanus species are typically low-growing and form dense mats, making them well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value, they are popular among desert gardeners and succulent enthusiasts."
