    "intro": "Gymnogramma pteridiformis, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Gymnogramma pteridiformis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
