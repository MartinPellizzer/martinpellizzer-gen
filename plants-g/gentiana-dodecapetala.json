    "intro": "Gentiana dodecapetala, commonly known as the twelve-petaled gentian, is a striking alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its large, cobalt-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant features a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its flowers are arranged in a single, showy inflorescence, with twelve petals that are slightly notched at the edges. Gentiana dodecapetala is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
