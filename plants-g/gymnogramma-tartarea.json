    "intro": "Gymnogramma tartarea, commonly known as the silver-stemmed holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint glow in the dark. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread along the forest floor. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, rounded lobes that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Gymnogramma tartarea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
