    "intro": "Galium maritimum var. villosum, commonly known as seaside bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in sandy or saline soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is adapted to harsh coastal environments, making it a resilient and hardy species."
