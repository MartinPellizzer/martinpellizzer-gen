It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves around the stem, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecology."
