    "intro": "Glyceria vaginata var. contracta, commonly known as narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 mm wide, giving it a distinct appearance compared to other members of the genus. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
