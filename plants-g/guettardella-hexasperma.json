    "intro": "Guettardella hexasperma, commonly known as the six-ribbed fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests and is found primarily in South America. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
