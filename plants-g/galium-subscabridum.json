It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant features slender, ascending stems that are often covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface. Small white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, and the plant produces small, dry fruits called achene. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
