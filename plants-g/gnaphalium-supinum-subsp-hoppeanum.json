    "intro": "Gnaphalium supinum subsp. hoppeanum, commonly known as the creeping cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are often clustered in loose inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it well adapted to temperate climates and marginal habitats."
