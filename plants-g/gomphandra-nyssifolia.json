It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
