    "intro": "Galenia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf galenia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be either basal or alternate depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Galenia heterophylla is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
