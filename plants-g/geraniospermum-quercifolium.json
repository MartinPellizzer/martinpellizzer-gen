    "intro": "Geraniospermum quercifolium, commonly known as the oak-leaf geranium, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that resemble those of an oak tree, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitat."
