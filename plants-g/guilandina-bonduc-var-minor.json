    "intro": "Guilandina bonduc var. minor, commonly known as the lesser African bean tree, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It produces large, showy yellow flowers that are followed by woody pods containing several seeds. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and thorned stems, which are typical of many leguminous species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories. The seeds are edible when properly prepared, though they contain toxic compounds that require careful processing."
