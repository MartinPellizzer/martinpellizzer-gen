    "intro": "Gentiana aquatica var. pseudoaquatica, commonly known as the water gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem. It thrives in wet meadows, stream banks, and other waterlogged habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptability to aquatic environments and its role in supporting local pollinators."
