    "intro": "Galium rigidum, commonly known as rigid bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and small, opposite leaves. Its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Galium rigidum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats in suitable habitats."
