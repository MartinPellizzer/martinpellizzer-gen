    "intro": "Gussonea conica, commonly known as the conical gussonea, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive conical shape and finely divided leaves. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are aromatic and often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Gussonea conica is typically found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
