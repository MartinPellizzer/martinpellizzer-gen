    "intro": "Globba amplectens, commonly known as the velvetleaf globba, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and form dense mats."
