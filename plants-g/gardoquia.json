    "intro": "Gardoquia, commonly known as the desert rose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to conserve water, making it highly drought-resistant. Its flowers are typically borne on long, slender peduncles, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. Gardoquia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to xeriscaping in dry climates."
