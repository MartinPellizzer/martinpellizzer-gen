    "intro": "Gnaphalium coriaceum, commonly known as woolly cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, hairy foliage that gives it a fuzzy appearance, and its small, daisy-like flowers are typically white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Gnaphalium coriaceum is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
