    "intro": "Gladiolus nanus ackermannii, commonly known as the dwarf gladiolus, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and white, which bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows to a height of only 10\u201320 centimeters, making it ideal for rock gardens or container planting. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and it is often used in horticultural displays for its ornamental value. This species is noted for its hardiness and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
