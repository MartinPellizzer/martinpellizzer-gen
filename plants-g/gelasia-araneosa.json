    "intro": "Gelasia araneosa, commonly known as the spider plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are followed by spherical, red berries. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Gelasia araneosa is also known for its ability to propagate through offsets, which are easily separated and planted."
