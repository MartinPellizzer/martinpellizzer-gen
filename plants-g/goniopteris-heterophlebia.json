    "intro": "Goniopteris heterophlebia, commonly known as the heterophlebia water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that are often mistaken for water lilies due to their similar appearance. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-producing sorus clusters located on the underside of the leaves. Goniopteris heterophlebia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
