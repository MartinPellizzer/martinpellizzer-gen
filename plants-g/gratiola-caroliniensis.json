It features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in loose clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Gratiola caroliniensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
