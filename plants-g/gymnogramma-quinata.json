    "intro": "Gymnogramma quinata, commonly known as the five-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into five lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and ponds. Gymnogramma quinata has small, spore-producing structures called sori that are located on the underside of its fronds. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
