It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces dark blue berries that are edible and have a sharp, spicy flavor due to the presence of methyl salicylate. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Gaultheria seshagiriana is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
