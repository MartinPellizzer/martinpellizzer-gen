It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is found in regions such as Western Australia and South Australia. Its distinctive feature is the presence of hairy structures on its stems and leaves, which aid in reducing water loss.
