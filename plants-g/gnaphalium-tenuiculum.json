    "intro": "Gnaphalium tenuiculum, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats on soil surfaces, often in moist or rocky habitats. Its small, inconspicuous flowers produce tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. Gnaphalium tenuiculum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
