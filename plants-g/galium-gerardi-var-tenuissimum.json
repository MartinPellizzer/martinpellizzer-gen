It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable component of native plant ecosystems."
