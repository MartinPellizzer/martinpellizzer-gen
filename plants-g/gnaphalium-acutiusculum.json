    "intro": "Gnaphalium acutiusculum, commonly known as the sharp-leaved everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant produces small, yellow to brownish flowers that are often arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gnaphalium acutiusculum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
