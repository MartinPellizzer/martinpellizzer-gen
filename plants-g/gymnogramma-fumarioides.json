    "intro": "Gymnogramma fumarioides, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a distinctive morphology with creeping rhizomes and lanceolate, serrated leaves. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Gymnogramma fumarioides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
