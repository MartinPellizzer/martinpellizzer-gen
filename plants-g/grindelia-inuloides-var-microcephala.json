    "intro": "Grindelia inuloides var. microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its hairy foliage helps reduce water loss, making it well-suited for dry conditions. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in rocky or sandy habitats."
