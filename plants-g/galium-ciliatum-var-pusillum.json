    "intro": "Galium ciliatum var. pusillum, commonly known as the small-leaved bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, often prostrate stems that are covered with fine, silky hairs. The leaves are small, opposite, and have a distinctive ciliate margin, giving the plant its scientific name. It produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
