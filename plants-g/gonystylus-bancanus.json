    "intro": "Gonystylus bancanus, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is known for its small, white flowers and elliptical leaves. It thrives in humid, lowland rainforest environments and is often found in secondary growth areas. Due to its slow growth and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
