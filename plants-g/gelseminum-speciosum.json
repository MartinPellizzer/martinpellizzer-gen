    "intro": "Gelseminum speciosum, commonly known as the yellow moonflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a climbing vine that produces large, showy, white flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance, particularly at night. The flowers open in the evening and close by dawn, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while the stems are woody and twining. The plant is also known for its toxic properties, containing tropane alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals."
