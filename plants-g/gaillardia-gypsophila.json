    "intro": "Gaillardia gypsophila, commonly known as the desert gaura, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of daisy-like flowers with orange and yellow petals. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-drained soil. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Gaillardia gypsophila is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
