    "intro": "Gooringia littledalei, commonly known as the Littledale's hartungia, is a rare and delicate fern native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that resemble those of other ferns in the genus. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or rocky crevices. Its small, spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of most ferns. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Gooringia littledalei is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
