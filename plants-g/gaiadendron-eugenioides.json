It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The tree is valued for its dense, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and cabinetry. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
