    "intro": "Gyrostachys saccata, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to thrive in arid environments. Gyrostachys saccata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
