    "intro": "Geranium sylvaticum var. glanduligerum, commonly known as the sticky geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving them a slightly sticky texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers with five petals, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its glandular leaves and showy flowers make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitats."
