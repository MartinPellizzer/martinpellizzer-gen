It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its flowers are typically red or orange, appearing in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators such as birds and insects. Grevillea ilicifolia var. lobata is also drought-tolerant and requires minimal pruning once established."
