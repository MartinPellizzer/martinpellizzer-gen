    "intro": "Gnaphalium panniforme, commonly known as the woolly groundsel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features dense, felt-like foliage composed of tiny, overlapping leaves that give it a soft, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gnaphalium panniforme is often found in rocky soils and dry slopes, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
