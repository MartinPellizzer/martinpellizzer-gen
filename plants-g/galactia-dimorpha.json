    "intro": "Galactia dimorpha, commonly known as the twin-lobed milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers clustered in umbels. The plant is notable for its milky sap, which contains alkaloids and is used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Galactia dimorpha plays a role in supporting local pollinators and has ecological significance in its native habitat."
