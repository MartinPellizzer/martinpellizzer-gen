    "intro": "Gonzalagunia cornifolia, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Gonzalagunia cornifolia plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for certain pollinators."
