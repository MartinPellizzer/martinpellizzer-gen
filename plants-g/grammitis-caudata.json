    "intro": "Grammitis caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a trailing or cascading appearance. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can maintain the high humidity it requires. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor the plant to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis caudata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, showcasing its adaptability to humid, low-light conditions."
