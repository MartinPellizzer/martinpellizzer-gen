    "intro": "Galium lapeyrousianum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that produce small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered with fine, soft hairs, though the variety glabrum is notable for its nearly hairless appearance. The fruit is a small, two-lobed capsule that disperses seeds through wind and water."
