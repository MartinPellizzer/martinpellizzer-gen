    "intro": "Garretia, commonly known as the bluebell of the genus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Garretia has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its botanical name, *Garretia*, is derived from the Latin word for \"to gather,\" possibly referencing its historical use in herbal medicine."
