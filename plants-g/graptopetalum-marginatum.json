It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
