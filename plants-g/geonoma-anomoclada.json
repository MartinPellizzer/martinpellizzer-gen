    "intro": "Geonoma anomoclada, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, clustered spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and partial light. Its fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush, green appearance throughout the year. Geonoma anomoclada is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
