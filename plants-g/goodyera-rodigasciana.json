    "intro": "Goodyera rodigasciana, commonly known as the rodigascent lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its intricate, fragrant inflorescence that resembles a tresses of hair. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and swamps, where it thrives in the dappled light under the canopy. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, bloom in late spring to early summer. Goodyera rodigasciana is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it sensitive to habitat disturbance."
