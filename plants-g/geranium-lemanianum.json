    "intro": "Geranium lemanianum, commonly known as the water geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as ponds and streams. Due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in wet conditions, it is a popular choice for water gardens and bog landscapes."
