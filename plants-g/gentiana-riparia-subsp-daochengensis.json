    "intro": "Gentiana riparia subsp. daochengensis, commonly known as the Daocheng gentian, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This subspecies is of significant botanical interest due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its alpine environment."
