    "intro": "Guidonia fragilis, commonly known as the brittlewood tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and delicate, light green leaves that are alternate and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by edible, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its fragility, it is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and historical significance."
