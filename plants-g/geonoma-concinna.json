    "intro": "Geonoma concinna, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bryophyte fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are short and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
