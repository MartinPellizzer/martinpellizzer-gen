    "intro": "Gentiana paludicola, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in bogs or along the edges of marshes. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine downy layer. Gentiana paludicola plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for various invertebrates."
