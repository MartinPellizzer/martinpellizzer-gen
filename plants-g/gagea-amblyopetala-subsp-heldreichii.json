    "intro": "Gagea amblyopetala subsp. heldreichii, commonly known as the Heldreich's starflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and prefers cool, moist environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, low-growing rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
