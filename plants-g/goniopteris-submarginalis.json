    "intro": "Goniopteris submarginalis, commonly known as the marginal shield fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. The plant features large, leathery fronds with a unique, shield-like shape, often with a margin that is broader than the central part. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located along the margins of the fronds, giving it its common name. Goniopteris submarginalis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks."
