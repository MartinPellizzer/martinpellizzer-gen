    "intro": "Gastrodia mairei, commonly known as the Maire's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often reddish-brown pseudobulbs, which store nutrients and water. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its underground rhizomes for photosynthesis. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming infrequently. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gastrodia mairei is considered a valuable subject in botanical research and conservation efforts."
