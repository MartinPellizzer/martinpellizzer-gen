    "intro": "Grabowskia obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grasses, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshy areas. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Grabowskia obtusa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to filter water."
