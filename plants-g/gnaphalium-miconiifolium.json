It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers and compact, shrub-like growth habit. Native to South America, particularly Brazil, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces copious amounts of fine, white hairs on its stems and leaves, which contribute to its common name. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its long-lasting flowers and attractive foliage."
