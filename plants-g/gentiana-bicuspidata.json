    "intro": "Gentiana bicuspidata, commonly known as the two-lobed gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and sometimes branched. The flowers are tubular with two lobes at the tip, giving the plant its common name and contributing to its ornamental appeal."
