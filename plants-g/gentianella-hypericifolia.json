It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its flowers are blue to violet in color, with five petals and prominent yellow spots, blooming from June to August. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
