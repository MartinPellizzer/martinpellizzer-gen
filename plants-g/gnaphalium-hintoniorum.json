It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant features slender, wiry stems that bear small, white to pale yellow flower heads, which are often mistaken for individual flowers. Its leaves are narrow and linear, typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its feathery appearance. Gnaphalium hintoniorum is adapted to dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils."
