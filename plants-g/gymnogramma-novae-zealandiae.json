    "intro": "Gymnogramma novae-zealandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand gymnogramma, is a small, evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 cm in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Gymnogramma novae-zealandiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
