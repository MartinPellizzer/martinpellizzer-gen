    "intro": "Glycosmis pentaphylla var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sugar-apple, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically narrow and glossy, with a distinct venation pattern. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers followed by small, round fruits that turn from green to red when mature. The fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a thin, fleshy pulp, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is adapted to warm, tropical climates."
