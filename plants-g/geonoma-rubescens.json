    "intro": "Geonoma rubescens, commonly known as the red-veined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fronds with a distinctive reddish hue along the veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a leathery texture and a dark green color that contrasts with the reddish vascular patterns."
