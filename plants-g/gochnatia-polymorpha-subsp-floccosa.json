    "intro": "Gochnatia polymorpha subsp. floccosa, commonly known as the silky gochnatia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a fluffy appearance, and it produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowering period typically occurs during the warmer months, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. The subspecies is distinguished by its more densely floccose (fluffy) foliage compared to other subspecies of Gochnatia."
