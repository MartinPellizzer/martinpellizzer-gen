    "intro": "Grewia mexicana, commonly known as Mexican globemallow, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
