It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its glandular, hairy leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypsela, which are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
