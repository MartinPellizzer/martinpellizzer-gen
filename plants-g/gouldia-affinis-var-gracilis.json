    "intro": "Gouldia affinis var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender gouldia, is a striking ornamental grass native to Australia. It features slender, arching stems that produce feathery, pinkish-white inflorescences, which add a soft, elegant touch to gardens. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, attractive clumps. Gouldia affinis var. gracilis is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for water-wise gardens."
