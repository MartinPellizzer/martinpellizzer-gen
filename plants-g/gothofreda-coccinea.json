    "intro": "Gothofreda coccinea, commonly known as the red-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. This plant is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with long, thin stems and translucent, waxy leaves that resemble the shape of a ghost. It produces vibrant red flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern of dark purple veins. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
