    "intro": "Galium davuricum var. davuricum, commonly known as dwarf wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or pale green coloration. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization."
