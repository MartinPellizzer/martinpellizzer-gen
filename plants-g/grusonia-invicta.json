    "intro": "Grusonia invicta, commonly known as the hardy hibiscus, is a perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a yellow or orange center. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and can be quite robust. Grusonia invicta is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
