    "intro": "Gnaphalium hiemale, commonly known as winter everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flower heads that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in colder climates. Gnaphalium hiemale is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks."
