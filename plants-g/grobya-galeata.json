    "intro": "Grobya galeata, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowering stems are usually hairy and can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. Grobya galeata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
