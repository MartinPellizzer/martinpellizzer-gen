    "intro": "Gymnogramma rutifolia var. hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish gymnogramma, is a species of fern native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinct midrib. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps in retaining moisture. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
