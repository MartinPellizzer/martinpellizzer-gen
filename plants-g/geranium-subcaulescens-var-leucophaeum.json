    "intro": "Geranium subcaulescens var. leucophaeum, commonly known as the white-leaf geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and extended flowering period."
