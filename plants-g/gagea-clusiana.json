    "intro": "Gagea clusiana, commonly known as the clustered gagea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, rounded bulbs that serve as its primary means of propagation. It thrives in woodland habitats and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Gagea clusiana is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
