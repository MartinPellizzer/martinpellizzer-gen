    "intro": "Grewia biloba, commonly known as the red gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, round, yellow fruits that are edible and often consumed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Grewia biloba is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
