    "intro": "Gastrodia bambu, commonly known as the bamboo orchid, is a unique parasitic plant belonging to the orchid family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host bamboo for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces a thick, fleshy, and often aromatic underground tuber that is prized in traditional medicine. It blooms with small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green. Due to its specialized growth requirements, it is rarely found in the wild and is difficult to cultivate."
