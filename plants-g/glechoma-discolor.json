    "intro": "Glechoma discolor, commonly known as the pale deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Glechoma discolor is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to spread via stolons."
