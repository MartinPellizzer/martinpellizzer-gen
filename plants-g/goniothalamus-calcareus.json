It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often whitish bark that can calcify over time. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, and its fruits are fleshy berries containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in limestone-rich soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
