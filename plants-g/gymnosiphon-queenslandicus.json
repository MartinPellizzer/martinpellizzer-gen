    "intro": "Gymnosiphon queenslandicus, commonly known as the Queensland ghost flower, is a rare and unique plant native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Podostomataceae and is characterized by its distinctive, ribbon-like leaves that float on the surface of still water. The plant lacks true roots and instead anchors itself using specialized structures called holdfasts. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters along the leaf blades. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
