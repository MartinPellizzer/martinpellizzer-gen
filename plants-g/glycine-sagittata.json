It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with arrowhead-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into edible, tangy berries resembling tiny tomatillos.

Its growth habit includes a low, spreading stem that can form dense mats in suitable conditions."
