    "intro": "Gagea erubescens, commonly known as the red-flowered gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and showy, pink to red flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or open areas. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive periods of dormancy. Gagea erubescens is often found in California and Oregon, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates."
