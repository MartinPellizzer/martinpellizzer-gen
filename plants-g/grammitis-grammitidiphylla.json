    "intro": "Grammitis grammitidiphylla, commonly known as the two-leafed huperborean fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Huperboreaee. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure known as a sporangium, which produces and releases spores for propagation. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
