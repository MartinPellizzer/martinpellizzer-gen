    "intro": "Galactia wrightii, commonly known as Wright's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pod fruits that contain several seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in arid environments. Galactia wrightii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in xeriscaped landscapes. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils."
