    "intro": "Gastrolobium stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system to access water. Gastrolobium stenophyllum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
