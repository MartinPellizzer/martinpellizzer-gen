    "intro": "Gardoquia salviifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf gardoquia, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Gardoquia salviifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
