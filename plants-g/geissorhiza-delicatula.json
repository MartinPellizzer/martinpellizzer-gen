    "intro": "Geissorhiza delicatula, commonly known as the delicate orchid or the small orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. It is a terrestrial orchid, meaning it grows in soil rather than on other plants, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
