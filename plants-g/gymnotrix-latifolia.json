    "intro": "Gymnotrix latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale purple, which bloom at night. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is known for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
