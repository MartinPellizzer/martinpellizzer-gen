    "intro": "Guatteria curvinervia, commonly known as the curved-veined guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Annonaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with distinctively curved veins, which give it its common name. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a fragrant scent, and it produces berries that are edible for some bird species. Guatteria curvinervia plays a role in local ecosystems as both a food source and a habitat for various organisms."
