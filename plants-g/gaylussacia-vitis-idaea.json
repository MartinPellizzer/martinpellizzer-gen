    "intro": "Gaylussacia vitis-idaea, commonly known as whortleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible, dark blue berries that are rich in antioxidants. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
