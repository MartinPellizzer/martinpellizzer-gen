    "intro": "Glomera rugulosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved glomera, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its unique foliage and modest floral display, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
