    "intro": "Gnaphalium albescens, commonly known as silverleaf ragwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white, woolly foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its aromatic, sometimes bitter scent. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
