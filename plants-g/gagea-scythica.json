The plant produces small, rounded bulbs that are adapted for survival in rocky or dry soils. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Gagea scythica is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
