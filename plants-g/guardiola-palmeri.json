    "intro": "Guardiola palmeri, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Guardiola palmeri plays an important ecological role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar and habitat for various wildlife species."
