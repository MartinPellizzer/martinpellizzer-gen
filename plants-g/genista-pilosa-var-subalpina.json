It is characterized by its wiry, thorny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
