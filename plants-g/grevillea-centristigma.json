It features narrow, needle-like leaves and produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Its flowering period attracts nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to local biodiversity."
