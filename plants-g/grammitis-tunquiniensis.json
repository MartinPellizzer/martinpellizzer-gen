    "intro": "Grammitis tunquiniensis, commonly known as the Tunquin fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in cloud forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. Grammitis tunquiniensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
