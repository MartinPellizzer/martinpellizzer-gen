It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a distinctive white or pale midrib. The plant produces striking orange to red flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid conditions and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
