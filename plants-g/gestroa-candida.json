    "intro": "Gestroa candida, commonly known as the white star orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are broad and glossy, adapted to maximize light capture in low-light conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral structure."
