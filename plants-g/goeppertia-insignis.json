    "intro": "Goeppertia insignis, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a striking member of the Zingiberaceae family, native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, striped leaves that resemble a zebra's coat, with alternating light and dark green bands. The plant produces tall, erect inflorescences bearing small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Goeppertia insignis is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
