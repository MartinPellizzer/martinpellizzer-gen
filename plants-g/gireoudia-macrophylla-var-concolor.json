    "intro": "Gireoudia macrophylla var. concolor, commonly known as the broad-leafed gireoudia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, often with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
