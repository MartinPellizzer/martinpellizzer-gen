    "intro": "Grewia analamerensis, commonly known as the African snowball, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small white flowers that resemble snowballs, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
