    "intro": "Galactia hispidula, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by legume pods containing several seeds. Galactia hispidula is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
