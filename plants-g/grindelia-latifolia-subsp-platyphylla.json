    "intro": "Grindelia latifolia subsp. platyphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The showy yellow flowers appear in clusters and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
