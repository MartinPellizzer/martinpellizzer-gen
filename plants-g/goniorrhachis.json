    "intro": "Goniorrhachis, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that produces clusters of yellow, pendulous flowers, which bloom in the summer. The plant's botanical name, Goniorrhachis, is derived from the Greek words \"gono\" meaning seed and \"rrhachis\" meaning a type of fruit, reflecting its reproductive structures. The leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptic in shape, with a smooth texture. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
