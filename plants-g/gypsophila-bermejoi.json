    "intro": "Gypsophila bermejoi, commonly known as the Sierra Madre gypsophila, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in dry, harsh environments. It produces small, narrow leaves and has a compact growth habit, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
