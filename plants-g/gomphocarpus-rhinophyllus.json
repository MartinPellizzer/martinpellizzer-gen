    "intro": "Gomphocarpus rhinophyllus, commonly known as the red milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a milky sap that is toxic to livestock and humans, containing cardiac glycosides. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are erect and often branched. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal."
