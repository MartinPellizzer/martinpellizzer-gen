    "intro": "Gasteranthus trifoliatus, commonly known as the three-leaf bellflower, is a strikingly beautiful plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with contrasting yellow throats. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. Gasteranthus trifoliatus thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
