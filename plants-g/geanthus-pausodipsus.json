It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
