These plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in umbels. Gymnanthes species typically produce a milky latex when the stems or leaves are damaged. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their attractive foliage and unique fruit structures."
