    "intro": "Gnaphalium luzuloides, commonly known as silverleaf cudweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Its silver-gray leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
