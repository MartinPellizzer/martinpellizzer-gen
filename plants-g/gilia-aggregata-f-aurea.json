    "intro": "Gilia aggregata f. aurea, commonly known as the golden gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and its flowers are clustered in racemes. This variety is distinguished by its vivid yellow coloration, which sets it apart from the more common white or pink-flowered forms of Gilia aggregata."
