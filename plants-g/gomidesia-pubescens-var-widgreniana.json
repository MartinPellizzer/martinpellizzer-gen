    "intro": "Gomidesia pubescens var. widgreniana, commonly known as the Widgren's hairy gomidesia, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and violet. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its morphology includes slender stems and opposite leaf arrangement, making it distinct from other related species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically interesting but poorly studied plant."
