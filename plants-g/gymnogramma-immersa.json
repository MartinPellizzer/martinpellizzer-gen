    "intro": "Gymnogramma immersa, commonly known as the submerged fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it often grows submerged or partially submerged. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Gymnogramma immersa plays a role in water filtration and is sometimes used in ornamental aquatic gardens."
