    "intro": "Galanthus cabardensis, commonly known as the Cabardian daffodil, is a species of bulbous plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 20 to 40 centimeters, with a slender stem that supports its delicate blooms. Its flowers have a distinctive, slightly curved shape and are often adorned with a greenish tint at the base. Galanthus cabardensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring display."
