    "intro": "Gleichenia squamosissima, commonly known as the scalycushion fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive scalloped or wavy margin. It produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the dry season. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
