    "intro": "Gelonium spicatum, commonly known as the spiky gelonium, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, spiky leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated in both gardens and botanical collections."
