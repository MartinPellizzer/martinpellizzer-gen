It features upright stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged blooming period."
