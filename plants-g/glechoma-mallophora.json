    "intro": "Glechoma mallophora, commonly known as the creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Glechoma mallophora thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread quickly, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain areas."
