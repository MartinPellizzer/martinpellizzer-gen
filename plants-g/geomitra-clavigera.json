    "intro": "Geomitra clavigera, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces small, white or purple flowers. Geomitra clavigera is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized bladders to capture and digest prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
