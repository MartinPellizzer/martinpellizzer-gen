    "intro": "Gutenbergia nivea, commonly known as the snowflake lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments. It is characterized by its white, powdery appearance, which gives it its common name. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium, typical of lichens. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forest regions. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution."
