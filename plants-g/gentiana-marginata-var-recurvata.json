    "intro": "Gentiana marginata var. recurvata, commonly known as the recurved gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and hardy nature."
