    "intro": "Gomortega keule, commonly known as the \"crown of the Andes,\" is a unique evergreen tree native to the cloud forests of southern Chile and northern Argentina. It is notable for its striking, lantern-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The tree has a distinctive, twisted trunk and can grow up to 20 meters tall, with glossy, dark green leaves. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly the Andean hillstar, making it an important part of the local ecosystem. Gomortega keule is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is considered a symbol of the region's biodiversity."
