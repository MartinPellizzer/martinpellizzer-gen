    "intro": "Georgina frustranea var. flava, commonly known as the yellow-flowered georgina, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring and early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, while its stems are slender and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
