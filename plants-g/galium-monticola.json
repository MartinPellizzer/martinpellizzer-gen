It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, often hairy stems that are often prostrate or ascending. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Galium monticola is adapted to rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
