    "intro": "Gymnogramma obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, lanceolate to ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. Gymnogramma obtusifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
