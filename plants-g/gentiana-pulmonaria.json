It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are basal, heart-shaped, and covered in a distinctive white or grayish felt-like coating.
