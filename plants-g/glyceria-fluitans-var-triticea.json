It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in panicles, with lemmas that are typically hairy and pointed. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels contributes to its ecological significance in wetland habitats."
