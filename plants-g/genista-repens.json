    "intro": "Genista repens, commonly known as creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Genista repens is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
