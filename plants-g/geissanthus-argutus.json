    "intro": "Geissanthus argutus, commonly known as the roughleaf geissanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
