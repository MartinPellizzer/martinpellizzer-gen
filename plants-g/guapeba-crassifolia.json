    "intro": "Guapeba crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved guapeba, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
