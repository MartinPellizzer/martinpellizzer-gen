It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in open, rocky areas and has a low, spreading growth habit. Its small yellow flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces fine, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Gnaphalium schimperi is also noted for its use in traditional medicine, particularly for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities."
