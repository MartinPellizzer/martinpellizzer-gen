    "intro": "Gaultheria pullei var. pullei, commonly known as the dwarf strawberry bush, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, edible berries. These berries are highly aromatic and contain a high concentration of aromatic oils, which contribute to their distinctive flavor. Gaultheria pullei var. pullei is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also valued for its medicinal properties due to the presence of compounds like methyl salicylate."
