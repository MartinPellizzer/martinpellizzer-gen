    "intro": "Geranium mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican geranium, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically produces bright red or pink blooms during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.
