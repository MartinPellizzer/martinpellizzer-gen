    "intro": "Goniopteris bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, large, and often lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
