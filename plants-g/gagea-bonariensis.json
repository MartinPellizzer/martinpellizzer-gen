    "intro": "Gagea bonariensis, commonly known as the Buenos Aires gagea, is a small, bulbous geophyte native to South America. It produces delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the spring. The plant is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that allow it to survive periods of dormancy. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
