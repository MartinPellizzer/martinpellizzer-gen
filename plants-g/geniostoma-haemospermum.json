    "intro": "Geniostoma haemospermum, commonly known as the bloodseed plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange seed pods that split open to release its seeds. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant's unique seed dispersal mechanism and vibrant floral display make it a notable species in its native habitats."
