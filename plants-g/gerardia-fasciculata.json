    "intro": "Gerardia fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered gerardia, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are arranged in dense clusters at the base. Its small, white or pale blue flowers bloom in late spring, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. Gerardia fasciculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
