    "intro": "Gymnacranthera murtonii var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean gymnacranthera, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the rainforests of Borneo and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface and a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is often found growing in the understory of dense tropical forests, where it thrives in humid and shaded conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
