    "intro": "Genista tomentella, commonly known as the woolly broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, leathery pods. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and Mediterranean climates. Genista tomentella is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
