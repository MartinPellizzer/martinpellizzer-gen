    "intro": "Gahnia mannii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in swampy or seasonally waterlogged soils. Gahnia mannii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
