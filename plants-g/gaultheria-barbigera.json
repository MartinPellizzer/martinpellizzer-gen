    "intro": "Gaultheria barbigera, commonly known as the hairy waxleaf, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that is often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring. Its berries are red and edible, though they are not commonly consumed by humans. Gaultheria barbigera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
