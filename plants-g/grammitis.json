    "intro": "Grammitis, commonly known as rock ferns, are a diverse group of epiphytic and lithophytic ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. They are characterized by their small, delicate fronds that often grow on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants typically have a short, creeping rhizome and produce spores in clusters on the undersides of their leaves. Grammitis species are often found in shaded, humid environments and are adapted to nutrient-poor substrates. Their unique growth habits and morphological features make them important components of forest ecosystems."
