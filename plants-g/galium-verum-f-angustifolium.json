    "intro": "Galium verum f. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved bedstraw, is a variant of the yellow bedstraw species. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, opposite leaves. The leaves are typically narrower than those of the typical form, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and woodland edges."
