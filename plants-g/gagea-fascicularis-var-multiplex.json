It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shady areas. Its bulbs are typically clustered, giving it the species name \"fascicularis,\" and it is closely related to other members of the Liliaceae family. The varietal form \"multiplex\" refers to its tendency to form multiple flower clusters, enhancing its ornamental value."
