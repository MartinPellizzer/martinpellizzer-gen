    "intro": "Grammitis cornuta, commonly known as the horned grammitis, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant features a distinctive, wiry rhizome that helps it anchor to rocky or shaded surfaces. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Grammitis cornuta is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices."
