    "intro": "Gagea pusilla subsp. tesquicola, commonly known as the Sierra gagea, is a small, perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of delicate, white or pale blue flowers in early spring. Its bulbs are small and underground, serving as storage organs for nutrients. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger size and more open growth habit compared to other members of the species."
