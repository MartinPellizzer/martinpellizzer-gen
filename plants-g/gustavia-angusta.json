    "intro": "Gustavia angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid climates."
