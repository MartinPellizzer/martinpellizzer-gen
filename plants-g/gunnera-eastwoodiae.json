    "intro": "Gunnera eastwoodiae, commonly known as the Eastwood's giant ragwort, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, which are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flower clusters in the spring, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening in temperate climates."
