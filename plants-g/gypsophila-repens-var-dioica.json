    "intro": "Gypsophila repens var. dioica, commonly known as the wandering bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branched stems that produce clusters of small, delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to dry, rocky soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ability to spread via runners makes it an effective ground cover in suitable climates."
