    "intro": "Glechoma lamiifolia, commonly known as ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves with a scalloped edge, and small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant is native to Europe and western Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in lawns, gardens, and along stream banks. Glechoma lamiifolia is known for its creeping growth habit and ability to form dense mats, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
