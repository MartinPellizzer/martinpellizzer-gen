    "intro": "Geochorda, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique ability to photosynthesize through its roots, which are often submerged in water or moist soil. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer, adding to its ethereal appearance. Geochorda is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate, ephemeral beauty. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
