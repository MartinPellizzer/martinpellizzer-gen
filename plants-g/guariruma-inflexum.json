    "intro": "Guariruma inflexum, commonly known as the Brazilian ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with elliptical leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
