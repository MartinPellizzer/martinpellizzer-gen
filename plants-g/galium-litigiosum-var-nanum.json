    "intro": "Galium litigiosum var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf wood-sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets, and it produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a creeping habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive yet often overlooked member of the Rubiaceae family."
