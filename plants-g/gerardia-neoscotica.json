    "intro": "Gerardia neoscotica, commonly known as the New Scotia gerardia, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, often found in rocky and sandy soils. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are usually pink or purple in color. Gerardia neoscotica plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is an indicator species for Arctic and alpine ecosystems."
