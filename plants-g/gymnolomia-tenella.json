    "intro": "Gymnolomia tenella, commonly known as the slender rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the arid environment. Gymnolomia tenella is valued for its unique appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
