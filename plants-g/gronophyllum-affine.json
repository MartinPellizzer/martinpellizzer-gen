    "intro": "Gronophyllum affine, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen contribute to its ecological importance in stabilizing sandy soils. The wood is dense and strong, historically used by indigenous peoples for tool-making and construction."
