    "intro": "Geranium asperum, commonly known as the rough geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, serrated leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or borders. Its foliage and flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value."
