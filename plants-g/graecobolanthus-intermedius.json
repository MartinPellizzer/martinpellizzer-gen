    "intro": "Graecobolanthus intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate sand couch, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with poor soil and limited water availability. Graecobolanthus intermedius plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
