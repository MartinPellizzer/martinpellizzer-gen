    "intro": "Galega patula, commonly known as Spanish needle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is an annual herb that grows up to 1 meter tall, featuring slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. Galega patula is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
