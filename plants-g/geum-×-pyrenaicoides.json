    "intro": "Geum \u00d7 pyrenaicoides, commonly known as the Pyrenean avens, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pink to red flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. It produces achenes as its fruit, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its natural propagation. Geum \u00d7 pyrenaicoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
