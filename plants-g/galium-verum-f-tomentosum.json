    "intro": "Galium verum f. tomentosum, commonly known as the yellow bedstraw, is a variant of the yellow woodruff plant. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, ascending stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves and stems are often covered in a soft, woolly texture due to the presence of the tomentose hairs. This form is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream sides."
