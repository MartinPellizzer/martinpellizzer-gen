    "intro": "Gaultheria barosmoides, commonly known as the Brazilian wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible and contain high concentrations of methyl salicylate, giving them a distinctive wintergreen scent. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for commercial use."
