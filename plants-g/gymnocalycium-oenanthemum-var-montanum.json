    "intro": "Gymnocalycium oenanthemum var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain moon cactus, is a succulent cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spiny, woolly areoles, which are typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
