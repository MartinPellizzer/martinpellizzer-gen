It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and along roadsides. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations compared to its parent species."
