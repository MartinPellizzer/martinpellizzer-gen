    "intro": "Ginalloa helferi, commonly known as the Helfer's ginalloa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with small, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Ginalloa helferi thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a humid, cool climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
