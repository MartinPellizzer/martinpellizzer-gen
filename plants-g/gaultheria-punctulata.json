    "intro": "Gaultheria punctulata, commonly known as the spotted wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or purplish underside. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, peppery flavor, often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Gaultheria punctulata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories."
