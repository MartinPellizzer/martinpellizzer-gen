    "intro": "Garnieria, commonly known as the waxflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae. These plants are native to South Africa and are characterized by their showy, waxy flowers that often resemble candles. Garnieria species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The flowers are usually pink, red, or white, and they bloom in spring or summer. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
