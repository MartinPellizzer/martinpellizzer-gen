    "intro": "Gossypium aureum, commonly known as the golden cottonwood, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. Gossypium aureum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
