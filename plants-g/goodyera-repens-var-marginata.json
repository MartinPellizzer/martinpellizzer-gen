    "intro": "Goodyera repens var. marginata, commonly known as the marginate basket-fern, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and heart-shaped, evergreen leaves that are often adorned with a distinctive white margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors, where it forms dense mats. Its unique foliage and subtle floral display make it a sought-after plant in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
