    "intro": "Galactia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in dry, rocky soils. Galactia microphylla has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for wildlife."
