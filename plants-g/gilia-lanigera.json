    "intro": "Gilia lanigera, commonly known as the woolly gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Gilia lanigera is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinators and its resilience to harsh conditions."
