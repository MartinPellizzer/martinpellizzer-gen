It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly rough texture and a strong, aromatic scent. Gouffeia stricta is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
