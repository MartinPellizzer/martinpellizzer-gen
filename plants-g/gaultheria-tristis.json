    "intro": "Gaultheria tristis, commonly known as the evergreen trailing twinflower, is a low-growing shrub native to the temperate regions of the southern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories, where it forms dense mats. The plant is also valued for its aromatic foliage, which contains compounds used in traditional medicine and as a source of methyl salicylate."
