    "intro": "Grammosolen odgersii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Grammosolen odgersii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
