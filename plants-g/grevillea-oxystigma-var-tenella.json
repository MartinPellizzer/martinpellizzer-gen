    "intro": "Grevillea oxystigma var. tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waratah, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and striking red or pink flowers that bloom in winter. The plant is part of the Proteaceae family and is adapted to well-drained soils in coastal and dry inland areas. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The variety tenella is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Grevillea oxystigma."
