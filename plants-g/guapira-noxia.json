    "intro": "Guapira noxia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its dense, glossy green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in ecological contexts."
