    "intro": "Galium mexicanum subsp. asperrimum, commonly known as rough bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and stems are covered in stiff, bristly hairs, contributing to its rough texture. It thrives in rocky, dry habitats and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks."
