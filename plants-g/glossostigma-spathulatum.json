    "intro": "Glossostigma spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly. Glossostigma spathulatum is valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
