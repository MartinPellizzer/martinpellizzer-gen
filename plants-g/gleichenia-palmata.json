    "intro": "Gleichenia palmata, commonly known as the palm fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its feather-like fronds that resemble the structure of a palm tree, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. Gleichenia palmata is widely distributed across the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
