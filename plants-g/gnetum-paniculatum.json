    "intro": "Gnetum paniculatum, commonly known as the tropical gnetum, is a gymnosperm native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often pinnately arranged and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female structures. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, orange-colored aril, which is an adaptation for animal dispersal. Gnetum paniculatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as tropical forests and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
