    "intro": "Geranium scabrum, commonly known as rough geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy and rough to the touch. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or red, typically blooming from late winter to early summer. Geranium scabrum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
