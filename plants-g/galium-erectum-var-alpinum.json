    "intro": "Galium erectum var. alpinum, commonly known as alpine bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Galium erectum var. alpinum thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
