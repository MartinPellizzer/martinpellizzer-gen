    "intro": "Glossidea biternata, commonly known as the three-lobed liverwort, is a species of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically flattened and closely arranged. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on rocky substrates. Glossidea biternata exhibits a distinctive three-lobed morphology, giving it its common name. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are specialized for sexual reproduction and are often clustered near the margins of the thallus."
