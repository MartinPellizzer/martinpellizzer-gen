    "intro": "Garnotia sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in Hawaii. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats on the island's windward sides. The plant has simple, opposite, and leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-yellow in color, and it produces small, fleshy fruits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Garnotia sandwicensis is critically endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
