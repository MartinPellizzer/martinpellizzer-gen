    "intro": "Gossypium latifolium f. pseudoracemosum, commonly known as the broadleaf cotton, is a botanical variant of the cotton plant characterized by its broad, lanceolate leaves and showy, racemose inflorescences. This subspecies is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers are typically pink to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces fluffy, white cotton bolls that contain the fibrous material used in textile production. Despite its agricultural potential, it is less commonly cultivated than other cotton species due to its specific environmental requirements."
