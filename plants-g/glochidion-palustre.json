    "intro": "Glochidion palustre, commonly known as the swamp glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Glochidion palustre is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
