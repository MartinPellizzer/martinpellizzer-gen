    "intro": "Goniophlebium grammatoides, commonly known as the paperbark fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
