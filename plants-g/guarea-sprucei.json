    "intro": "Guarea sprucei, commonly known as the white guarea, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other hardwoods. The tree is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found in lowland rainforests. The wood of Guarea sprucei is valued for its durability and fine grain, though it is less commonly used commercially compared to other species in the same family."
