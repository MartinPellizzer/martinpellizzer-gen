    "intro": "Goodyera amoena, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and its striking, pinkish-purple flowers that resemble small slippers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, often on the roots of trees. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Goodyera amoena is a low-growing perennial that thrives in humid, temperate climates."
