    "intro": "Galedupa, commonly known as the sacred mountain orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale purple. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and cultural significance make it a prized species among botanists and horticulturists. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Galedupa is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
