    "intro": "Geranium anemonifolium var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf geranium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, palmate leaves that resemble those of an anemone, giving it its species name. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
