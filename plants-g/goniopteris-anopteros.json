    "intro": "Goniopteris anopteros, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often glossy fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The fronds are typically divided into lobes that are smooth and not toothed, giving the plant its specific epithet \"anopteros,\" meaning without teeth. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and can spread to form dense colonies, making it a common sight in forest understories."
