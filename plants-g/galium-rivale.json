    "intro": "Galium rivale, commonly known as water chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of its stems. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. Galium rivale is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in waterlogged or damp soils."
