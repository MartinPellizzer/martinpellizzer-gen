    "intro": "Gypsophila hungarica, commonly known as the Hungarian laceflower, is a perennial plant native to Hungary and parts of the Balkans. It belongs to the Carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, feathery flowers that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for alpine and steppe environments. Its flowers are usually white or pink, with a fluffy appearance that adds a soft, ethereal look to gardens. Gypsophila hungarica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in floral arrangements due to its unique texture and color."
