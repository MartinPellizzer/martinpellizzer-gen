    "intro": "Gymnopteris bipinnata var. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate holly fern, is a variant of the broad-ferns family (Pteridaceae). It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are divided into two sets of pinnae. The fronds are typically lanceolate and have a distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) base, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
