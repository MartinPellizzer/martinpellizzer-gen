    "intro": "Gastrolychnis apetala, commonly known as the leafless morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only tendrils and flowers present. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Gastrolychnis apetala is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories."
