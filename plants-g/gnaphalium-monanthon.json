    "intro": "Gnaphalium monanthon, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense mats or cushions, with small, hairy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense heads, which are characteristic of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. Gnaphalium monanthon is known for its ability to tolerate various environmental conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
