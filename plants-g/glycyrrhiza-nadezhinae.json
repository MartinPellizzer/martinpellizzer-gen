    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza nadezhinae, commonly known as the Nadezhina's licorice, is a rare and lesser-known species of the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fluffy pods that contain seeds. Its roots are particularly notable for their high concentration of glycyrrhizin, a compound responsible for its sweet taste and medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Glycyrrhiza nadezhinae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
