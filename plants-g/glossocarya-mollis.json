    "intro": "Glossocarya mollis, commonly known as the smoothleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are smooth and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Glossocarya mollis is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
