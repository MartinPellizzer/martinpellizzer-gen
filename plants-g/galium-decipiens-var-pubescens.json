    "intro": "Galium decipiens var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent wood sorrel, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant is native to parts of North America and thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its hairy (pubescent) stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. This variant is often confused with other Galium species due to its similar morphology."
