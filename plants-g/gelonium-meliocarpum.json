    "intro": "Gelonium meliocarpum, commonly known as the sweetgum tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its star-shaped leaves and distinctive spherical, spiky fruit known as a gumball. The plant has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by the development of its unique, woody fruit. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in urban landscapes for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
