    "intro": "Gagea liotardii var. algeriensis, commonly known as the Algerian gagea, is a bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Algeria. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered bulbs and slender, grass-like foliage. The plant produces delicate white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are often clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
