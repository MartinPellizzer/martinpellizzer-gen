It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting pollinators like birds and insects. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces long, twisting tendrils that help it climb supports. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for warm climates.
