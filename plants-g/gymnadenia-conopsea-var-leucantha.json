    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea var. leucantha, commonly known as the white lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, white or pale pink flower spikes that resemble a tresses of hair, blooming in late summer. The plant grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, often forming dense colonies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, and it is known for its delicate, grass-like leaves. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in botanical gardens and natural reserves."
