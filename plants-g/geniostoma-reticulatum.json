    "intro": "Geniostoma reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive network of veins. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are usually short and thick, supporting the growth of its aerial fronds. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
