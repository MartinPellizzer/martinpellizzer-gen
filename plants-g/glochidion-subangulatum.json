    "intro": "Glochidion subangulatum, commonly known as the narrow-angled glabrous wood, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often glabrous or nearly so. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
