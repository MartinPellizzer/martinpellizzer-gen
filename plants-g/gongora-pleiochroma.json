    "intro": "Gongora pleiochroma, commonly known as the rainbow orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful flowers that display a wide range of hues, including red, orange, yellow, and purple. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its inflorescence consists of a raceme of showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.
