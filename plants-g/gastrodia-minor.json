    "intro": "Gastrodia minor, commonly known as the lesser thunder god, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrients. The plant produces unique, fleshy, yellowish-brown pseudobulbs that store energy and support its growth. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically have a distinctive, often fragrant appearance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Gastrodia minor is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
