    "intro": "Gynochthodes calciphila, commonly known as the limestone bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that trap small organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. This plant thrives in calcareous (limestone-rich) waters, typically in shallow, still pools or wetlands. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. Gynochthodes calciphila plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and maintaining water quality."
