    "intro": "Guzmania compacta, commonly known as the compact flame plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliad family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup to collect water and nutrients. Its striking inflorescence consists of vibrant red bracts that surround small, inconspicuous flowers. Guzmania compacta is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light."
