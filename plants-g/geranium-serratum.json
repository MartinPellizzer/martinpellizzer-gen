    "intro": "Geranium serratum, commonly known as the serrated geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Geranium serratum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
