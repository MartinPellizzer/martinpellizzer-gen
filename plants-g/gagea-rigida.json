    "intro": "Gagea rigida, commonly known as the rigid gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or mountainous habitats. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive in harsh environmental conditions. Gagea rigida is often found in the Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges, where it thrives in cool, shaded areas."
