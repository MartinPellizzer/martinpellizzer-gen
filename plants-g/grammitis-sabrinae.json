    "intro": "Grammitis sabrinae, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fertile leaves, which are often smaller and more compact than the sterile fronds. Grammitis sabrinae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
