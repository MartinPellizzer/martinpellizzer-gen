It is a low-growing herb with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical form. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves and stems are often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
