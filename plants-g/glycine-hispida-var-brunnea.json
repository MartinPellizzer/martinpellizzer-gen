    "intro": "Glycine hispida var. brunnea, commonly known as the brown hairy bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated, brown pods. The plant is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Glycine hispida var. brunnea is valued for its ornamental appearance and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
