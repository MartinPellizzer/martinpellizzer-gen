    "intro": "Galium gracile f. rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are ovate to round in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stems. Small white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
