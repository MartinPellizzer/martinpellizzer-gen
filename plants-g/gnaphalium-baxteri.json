    "intro": "Gnaphalium baxteri, commonly known as the Baxter's everlasting, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces a fine, fluffy covering on its stems and leaves, which helps to reduce water loss and protect it from herbivores. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Gnaphalium baxteri is a perennial herb that is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
