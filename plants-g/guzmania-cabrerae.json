    "intro": "Guzmania cabrerae, commonly known as the Cabrera\u2019s bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that often displays bright red, orange, or yellow hues. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small invertebrates. Its roots are adapted for absorbing nutrients from the air and debris around it, making it well-suited for its natural habitat. Guzmania cabrerae is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
