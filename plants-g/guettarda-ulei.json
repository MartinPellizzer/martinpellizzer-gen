    "intro": "Guettarda ulei, commonly known as the oil tree or black mangrove, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, waxy leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain a single seed, often dispersed by water. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. Guettarda ulei is often found in coastal areas and brackish water environments, making it an important species in mangrove ecosystems."
