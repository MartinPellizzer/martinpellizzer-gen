    "intro": "Gerardiopsis, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plants typically grow in moist, open habitats such as prairies and wetlands. Gerardiopsis species are known for their small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to their limited distribution and habitat specificity, they are often considered rare or endangered."
