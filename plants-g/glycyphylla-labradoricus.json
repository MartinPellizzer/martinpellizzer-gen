    "intro": "Glycyphylla labradoricus, commonly known as Labrador sweet pepper, is a perennial shrub native to the Labrador region of Canada. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. These flowers give way to bright red, fleshy berries that are edible and have a sweet, peppery flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in boreal forest ecosystems."
