    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea var. ecalcarata, commonly known as the early marsh gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wet meadows and marshes in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has erect, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically arranged in racemes and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. This variant is distinguished by its shorter calyces compared to the typical form of Gymnadenia conopsea."
