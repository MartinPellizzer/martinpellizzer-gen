    "intro": "Garcinia smeathmanii var. orientalis, commonly known as the Malabar tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and often pinnate, and its yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces small, fleshy fruits that turn from green to yellow as they mature. The fruit's pulp is acidic and contains a high concentration of tannins, making it useful in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in dense forest understories."
