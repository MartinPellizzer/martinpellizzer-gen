    "intro": "Gastrochilus guangtungensis, commonly known as Guangdong gastrochilus, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to southern China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its botanical features include a short rhizome and lanceolate leaves with a waxy surface. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
