    "intro": "Grammitis cuencana, commonly known as the Cuencan fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in montane regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern on the underside of its leaves. Grammitis cuencana is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
