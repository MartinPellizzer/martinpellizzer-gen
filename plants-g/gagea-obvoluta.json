    "intro": "Gagea obvoluta, commonly known as the curled gagea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its bulbs are covered in a distinctive, membranous sheath that gives it its common name. Gagea obvoluta is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments and is a valuable component of native plant communities."
