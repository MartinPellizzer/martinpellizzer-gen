    "intro": "Gnetum philippinense, commonly known as the Philippine gnetum, is a tropical evergreen shrub belonging to the family Gnetaceae. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often lanceolate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, unisexual flowers, with male and female flowers typically occurring on separate plants. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, three-lobed aril, which is a unique feature among gymnosperms. Gnetum philippinense is native to the Philippines and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments."
