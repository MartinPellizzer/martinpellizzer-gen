It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
