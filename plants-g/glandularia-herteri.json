    "intro": "Glandularia herteri, commonly known as the Herteri's glandular sage, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and spikes of purple or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its glandular structures on the leaves produce essential oils, which may play a role in deterring herbivores and attracting pollinators."
