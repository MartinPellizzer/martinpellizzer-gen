    "intro": "Grammitis phlegmaria, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. Its small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures are typically found on the undersides of its leaves. Grammitis phlegmaria is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
