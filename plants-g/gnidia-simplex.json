    "intro": "Gnidia simplex, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically silver-white in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red or orange berries. Gnidia simplex is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
