    "intro": "Gagea circumplexa, commonly known as the clustered gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces rounded, white bulbs that store nutrients for the next growing season. It typically blooms in early spring and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Gagea circumplexa is often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
