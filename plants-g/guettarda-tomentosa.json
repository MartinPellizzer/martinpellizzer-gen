    "intro": "Guettarda tomentosa, commonly known as the silky guettarda, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy texture, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Guettarda tomentosa is well adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy choice for seaside gardens."
