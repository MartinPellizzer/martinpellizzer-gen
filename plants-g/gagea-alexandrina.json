It is a small, bulbous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and bears white or pale pink flowers in early spring. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
