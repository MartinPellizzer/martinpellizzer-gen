It is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They have simple, opposite leaves and produce berries that contain toxic seeds. Geissoloma species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental flowers and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
