    "intro": "Gilia virgata var. dasyantha, commonly known as the woolly gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a reddish or purple tinge. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinators."
