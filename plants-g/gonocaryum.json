    "intro": "Gonocaryum, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Rhizophoraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and aerial roots that help it anchor in waterlogged soils. The plant thrives in coastal areas, particularly in mangrove forests, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. Its leaves are alternate,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Gonocaryum is also notable for its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding."
