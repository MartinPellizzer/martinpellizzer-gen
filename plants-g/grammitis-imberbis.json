    "intro": "Grammitis imberbis, commonly known as the hairless fork fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form dense, mat-like growths on trees or rocks. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its rhizomes and leaf surfaces. Its small, inconspicuous spores are dispersed by wind, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Grammitis imberbis is often found in cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
