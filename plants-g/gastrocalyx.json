    "intro": "Gastrocalyx, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique bladder-like structures called utricles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. Gastrocalyx species are typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. They are carnivorous plants that supplement their nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey. Their botanical features include small, delicate flowers and a specialized root system adapted for aquatic environments."
