    "intro": "Galium procurrens, commonly known as creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Galium procurrens thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
