    "intro": "Gomphocarpus asclepiaceus, commonly known as the milkweed or the blue milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers. The plant has a milky sap that is toxic and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, while the stem is erect and often branched. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release the seeds, which are often attached to silky hairs for wind dispersal."
