    "intro": "Glechoma hederacea var. umbrosa, commonly known as creeping ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its spreading growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in loose clusters. The plant is known for its aromatic leaves and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and garden beds. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed. Its botanical name reflects its close relation to the species Glechoma hederacea, with \"umbrosa\" referring to its preference for shady conditions."
