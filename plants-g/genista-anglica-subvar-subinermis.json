    "intro": "Genista anglica subvar. subinermis, commonly known as the English broom or creeping broom, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, often prostrate stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, woody pods containing several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in coastal or sandy environments."
