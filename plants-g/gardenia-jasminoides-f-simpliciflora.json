    "intro": "Gardenia jasminoides f. simpliciflora, commonly known as the simple-flowered gardenia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and fragrant, white flowers with a high degree of symmetry. The flowers are typically smaller and more clustered compared to the standard gardenia, giving it a more subdued appearance. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens. It prefers partial shade and well-drained soil, and it produces yellow-orange berries that contain toxic seeds."
