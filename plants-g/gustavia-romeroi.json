    "intro": "Gustavia romeroi, commonly known as the white sablewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red fruits containing edible seeds. Gustavia romeroi is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats, where it thrives in humid, warm climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
