    "intro": "Goniopteris \u00d7 rolandii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Goniopteris lepidostoma and Goniopteris venosa. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae and a light green to pale yellow coloration. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity. It has no true roots but relies on rhizomes for vegetative propagation. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
