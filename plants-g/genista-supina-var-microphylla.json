    "intro": "Genista supina var. microphylla, commonly known as the creeping broom or dwarf broom, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, giving it a dense, carpet-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact size and hardy nature make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry, sunny environments."
