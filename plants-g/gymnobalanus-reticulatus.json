    "intro": "Gymnobalanus reticulatus, commonly known as the net-veined mangrove, is a tropical tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and distinctive net-like venation on its leaves. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems. Its small, white flowers are followed by elliptical, woody fruits that contain a single seed. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
