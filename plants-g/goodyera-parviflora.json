    "intro": "Goodyera parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is a low-growing plant with a rhizomatous root system and a rosette of ovate, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are typically less than 1 cm in size, clustered along a slender stem. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found growing on the forest floor. Goodyera parviflora is known for its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
