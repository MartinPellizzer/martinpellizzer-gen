    "intro": "Grindelia prostrata, commonly known as creeping gumweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with silver-green, woolly leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert regions. Grindelia prostrata is adapted to withstand drought and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental appearance and drought tolerance."
