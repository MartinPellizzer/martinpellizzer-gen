    "intro": "Grastidium incumbens, commonly known as the narrowleaf stork's-bill, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white to pale blue flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in the spring. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
