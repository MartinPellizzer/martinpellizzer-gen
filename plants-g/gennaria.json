    "intro": "Gennaria, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. These plants are typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in temperate regions. Gennaria species are characterized by their small, clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves that help them retain moisture. They are generally perennial and can form dense mats or low shrubs. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value."
