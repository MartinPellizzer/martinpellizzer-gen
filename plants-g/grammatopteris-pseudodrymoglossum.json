    "intro": "Grammatopteris pseudodrymoglossum, commonly known as the false drymoglossum fern, is a fossilized plant from the Carboniferous period. It belongs to the genus Grammatopteris, which is characterized by its distinctive, finely veined leaves. The plant's fronds were typically small and narrow, with a complex venation pattern that suggests a highly specialized photosynthetic adaptation. It is often found in coal-bearing strata, indicating it thrived in swampy, tropical environments. Its morphology provides valuable insights into the evolution of early seed plants."
