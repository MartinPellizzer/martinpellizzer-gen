    "intro": "Glyceria explanata, commonly known as the broadleaf grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often flat and arranged in a fan shape, with a distinct midrib. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Glyceria explanata plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
