    "intro": "Galactia tenera, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial legume characterized by its trailing growth habit and compound leaves with small, hairy stipules. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by pods that contain several seeds. Galactia tenera has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils."
