    "intro": "Glyceria distans, commonly known as the narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like blades and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland areas. Glyceria distans is also a food source for various aquatic and terrestrial herbivores."
