    "intro": "Gaultheria cordifolia, commonly known as the red evergreen or twinflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its waxy, dark green leaves that are oval and heart-shaped, with a reddish underside. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by bright red berries in the summer. These berries are edible and contain a high concentration of salicylic acid, which is responsible for the plant's medicinal properties. Gaultheria cordifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
