    "intro": "Grindelia scorzonerifolia var. subintegra, commonly known as the desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, sharing structural similarities with other members of the sunflower family."
