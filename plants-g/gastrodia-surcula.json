    "intro": "Gastrodia surcula, commonly known as the Chinese club moss, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its club-shaped underground tubers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has specialized structures called rhizomes that store nutrients. It is typically found in shaded, humid environments and requires specific conditions for successful cultivation. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of significant interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
