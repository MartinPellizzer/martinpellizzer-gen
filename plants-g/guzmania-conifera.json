    "intro": "Guzmania conifera, commonly known as the pinecone bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, pinecone-like inflorescence that emerges from a rosette of grass-like leaves. The plant's foliage is typically dark green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. Guzmania conifera thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical plant collections."
