    "intro": "Gratiola viscidula subsp. typica, commonly known as sticky bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its submerged, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it can anchor itself to substrates with its root system. The plant's leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its stems are often branched and covered in a sticky substance. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in nutrient-rich, oxygenated environments. The species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and serving as a food source for various invertebrates."
