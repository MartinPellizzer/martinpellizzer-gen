    "intro": "Gymnocalycium quehlianum var. terweemeanum, commonly known as the Terweeman's moon cactus, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that often branch out. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but striking. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
