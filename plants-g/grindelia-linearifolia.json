It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert regions. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid environments. Grindelia linearifolia is also known for its resinous secretions, which can cause skin irritation in some individuals."
