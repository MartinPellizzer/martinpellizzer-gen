    "intro": "Gymnocalycium weissianum var. atroroseum, commonly known as the dark rose globose cactus, is a species native to Argentina. It is characterized by its spherical or slightly ellipsoidal stem that is typically covered in a dense layer of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often obscured by the spines. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative cactus in collections."
