    "intro": "Gymnobalanus, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapotaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and brackish water environments, where they play a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. Gymnobalanus species are characterized by their woody structure, alternate leaves, and small, clustered flowers. They produce fleshy, orange-red fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. The genus includes several species, such as Gymnobalanus madruno and Gymnobalanus tomentosus, which are adapted to saline conditions."
