    "intro": "Gongora odoratissima, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance, which attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. Gongora odoratissima is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
