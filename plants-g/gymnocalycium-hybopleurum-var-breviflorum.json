    "intro": "Gymnocalycium hybopleurum var. breviflorum, commonly known as the short-flowered moon cactus, is a compact cactus species native to Argentina. It features a short, thick stem with a single, rounded spine cluster at the top. The plant produces small, white flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
