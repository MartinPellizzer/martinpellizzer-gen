    "intro": "Geranium pratense var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale cranesbill, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
