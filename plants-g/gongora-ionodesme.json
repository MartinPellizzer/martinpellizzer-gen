It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that resemble flames, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces showy, elongated inflorescences that bear numerous blooms, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Gongora ionodesme has a complex root system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, adapted to capture light in its natural habitat."
