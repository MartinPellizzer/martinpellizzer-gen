    "intro": "Gyrostachys ramentacea, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, wiry foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Gyrostachys ramentacea is adapted to poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
