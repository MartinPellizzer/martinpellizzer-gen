    "intro": "Gymnogramma caracasana, commonly known as the Caracas spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky surfaces or soil. Gymnogramma caracasana is notable for its ability to colonize disturbed areas and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
