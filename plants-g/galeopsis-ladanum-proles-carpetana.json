    "intro": "Galeopsis ladanum proles carpetana, commonly known as carpetweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Carpetweed is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and garden beds, and is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas."
