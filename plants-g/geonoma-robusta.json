    "intro": "Geonoma robusta, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. These trichomes help the plant retain moisture and protect it from intense sunlight. Geonoma robusta is often found growing on tree trunks or in shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid, warm environments."
