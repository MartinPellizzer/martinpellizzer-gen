It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive rust-colored margin, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and compact growth habit."
