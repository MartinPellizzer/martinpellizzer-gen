    "intro": "Gentianella tubulosa, commonly known as the slender gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are blue to purple in color, with five petals and a distinctive tubular shape, which attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Gentianella tubulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
