    "intro": "Gagea foliosa subsp. soleirolii, commonly known as the Soleiroli's spring beauty, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in cool, shaded environments. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
