    "intro": "Gymnadenia graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-leaved gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes at the top of the stems. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
