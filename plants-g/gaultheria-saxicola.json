    "intro": "Gaultheria saxicola, commonly known as the rock cranberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It produces small, edible berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a tart, cranberry-like flavor. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and maritime climates. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and emit a subtle minty aroma when crushed. Gaultheria saxicola is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and unique appearance."
