    "intro": "Genista salzmannii subsp. limbarae, commonly known as the Salzmann\u2019s broom, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
