It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to the moist, nutrient-poor conditions of its habitat. It is part of the Gentianaceae family, known for its showy, often blue or purple flowers. This subspecies is particularly notable for its ability to thrive in acidic, waterlogged soils."
