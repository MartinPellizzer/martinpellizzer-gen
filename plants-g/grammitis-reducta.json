    "intro": "Grammitis reducta, commonly known as the reduced maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Grammitis reducta is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
