    "intro": "Grammitis curvata, commonly known as the curly maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, rounded lobes along the fronds. Grammitis curvata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
