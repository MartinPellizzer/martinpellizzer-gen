    "intro": "Gilia palmifrons, commonly known as the broadleaf gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which give it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting various pollinators. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Gilia palmifrons is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in local biodiversity."
