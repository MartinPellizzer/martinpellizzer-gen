    "intro": "Galium aparine subsp. vaillantii, commonly known as common bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that are covered with stiff, hooked hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are opposite, simple, and often notched at the base. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to other Galium species, particularly in the structure of its stems and leaves."
