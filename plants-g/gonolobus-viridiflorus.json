    "intro": "Gonolobus viridiflorus, commonly known as greenflower dodder, is a flowering plant in the family Convolvulaceae. It is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
