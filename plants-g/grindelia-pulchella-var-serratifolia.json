    "intro": "Grindelia pulchella var. serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and grassland habitats. Its leaves are serrated and covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
