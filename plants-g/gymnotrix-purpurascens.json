    "intro": "Gymnotrix purpurascens, commonly known as the purple ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Colombia. It is characterized by its striking violet and white flowers, which resemble those of the ghost orchid, and its unique ability to grow epiphytically on tree bark. The plant has a short, fleshy stem and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Gymnotrix purpurascens is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
