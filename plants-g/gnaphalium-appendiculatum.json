    "intro": "Gnaphalium appendiculatum, commonly known as the clustered everlasting, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits that contain a single seed, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Its fibrous roots and drought-resistant nature make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
