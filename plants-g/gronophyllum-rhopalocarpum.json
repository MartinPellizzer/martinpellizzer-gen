    "intro": "Gronophyllum rhopalocarpum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a member of the Burseraceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resistance to drought and poor soil conditions. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used for construction and tool-making."
