    "intro": "Gymnopogon fastigiatus subsp. fastigiatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and is often found in disturbed or marginal areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable component of its native ecosystems."
