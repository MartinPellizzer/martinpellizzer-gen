    "intro": "Gagea minutissima, commonly known as the dwarf gagea, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open woodlands and alpine meadows. It produces a bulbous stem that stores nutrients, enabling it to survive in harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
