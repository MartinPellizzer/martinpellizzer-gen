    "intro": "Gilia setosissima, commonly known as the hairy gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to arid environments, helping to reduce water loss. Gilia setosissima is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
