    "intro": "Gongora incarum, commonly known as the Purple Lady's Slipper, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking violet and white flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. Gongora incarum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
