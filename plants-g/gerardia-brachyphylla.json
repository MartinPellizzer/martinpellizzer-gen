    "intro": "Gerardia brachyphylla, commonly known as the dwarf gerardia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late summer. Gerardia brachyphylla is well adapted to harsh, cold environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in permafrost conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra ecosystems."
