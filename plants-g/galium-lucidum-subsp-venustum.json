    "intro": "Galium lucidum subsp. venustum, commonly known as shining bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and opposite, simple leaves that are often glossy and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. Its roots are fibrous and its growth habit makes it a common weed in disturbed soils. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
