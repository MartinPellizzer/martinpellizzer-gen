    "intro": "Geranium arborescens, commonly known as the tree geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a woody base that gives it a tree-like appearance, with upright stems that can grow up to 3 feet tall. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple, typically blooming from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Geranium arborescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
