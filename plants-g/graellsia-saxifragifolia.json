    "intro": "Graellsia saxifragifolia, commonly known as the Sierra Lily, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges in western North America. It is a member of the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, spurred petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Graellsia saxifragifolia is often found in open meadows and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
