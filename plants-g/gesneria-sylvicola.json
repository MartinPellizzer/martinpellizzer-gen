    "intro": "Gesneria sylvicola, commonly known as the forest gesneria, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, and it requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture to flourish. Gesneria sylvicola is also valued for its ability to produce offsets, making it relatively easy to propagate through division."
