    "intro": "Grevillea neurophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grevillea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. It has a woody stem and produces small, follicle-like fruits that contain the seeds. Grevillea neurophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
