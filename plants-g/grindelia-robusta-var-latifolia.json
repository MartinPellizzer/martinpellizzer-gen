It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine,\u7ed2\u6bdb, which help reduce water loss. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
