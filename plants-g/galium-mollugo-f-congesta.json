It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often form dense mats. The plant features small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in groups of three to six, giving it its \"congesta\" variety name. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
