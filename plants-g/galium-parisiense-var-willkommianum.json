    "intro": "Galium parisiense var. willkommianum, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features slender, stoloniferous stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a common but often overlooked component of wetland and forest ecosystems."
