    "intro": "Guzmania remyi, commonly known as the red-tipped guzmania, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that typically features red bracts and yellow flowers. The plant has a rosette-shaped leaf structure that collects water, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. Its leaves are broad, leathery, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Guzmania remyi thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush appearance."
