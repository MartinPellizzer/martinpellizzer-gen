    "intro": "Grevillea polyacida, commonly known as the coastal grevillea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern and western Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically grey-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Grevillea polyacida is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
