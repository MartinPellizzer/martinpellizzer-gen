It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Its unique leaf morphology, with truncate or notched leaflets, distinguishes it from other species in the genus. Gonolobus truncatifolius is also notable for its medicinal uses in traditional African medicine."
