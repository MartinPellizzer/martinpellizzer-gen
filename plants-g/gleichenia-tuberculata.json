    "intro": "Gleichenia tuberculata, commonly known as the knob moss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically lance-shaped and have a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant produces sporangia in clusters along the margins of the fronds, which are often raised and tuberculate, giving it its common name. Gleichenia tuberculata is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
