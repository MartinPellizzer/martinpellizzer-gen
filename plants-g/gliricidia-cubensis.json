    "intro": "Gliricidia cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban glory pea, is a fast-growing leguminous tree native to the Caribbean. It has compound leaves with three to seven elliptical leaflets, and it produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable for soil enrichment. It is often used in agroforestry and as a windbreak due to its dense foliage and rapid growth. Additionally, its seeds and leaves are used in traditional medicine and animal feed."
