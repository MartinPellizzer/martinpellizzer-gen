    "intro": "Glochidion saccocarpum, commonly known as the broad-leaved glabrous sycamore, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including parts of Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, a typical feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in natural habitats."
