    "intro": "Genista spachiana, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sunny environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often have a slight pubescence, while its stems are wiry and branching. Genista spachiana is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive floral display and hardy nature."
