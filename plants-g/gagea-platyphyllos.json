    "intro": "Gagea platyphyllos, commonly known as the broad-leaved gagea, is a small, bulbous perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in dry conditions, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Gagea platyphyllos is often found in mountainous regions and is a common component of alpine plant communities."
