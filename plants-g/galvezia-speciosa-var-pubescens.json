    "intro": "Galvezia speciosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy galvezia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, showcasing its adaptability to arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are hairy, which helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
