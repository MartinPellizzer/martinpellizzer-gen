It features opposite, simple leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate, with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are slender and often prostrate, allowing it to spread across the ground. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
