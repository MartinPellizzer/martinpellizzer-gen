    "intro": "Godetia pacifica, commonly known as the pacific godetia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it thrives in salty and windy conditions. Its showy, yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
