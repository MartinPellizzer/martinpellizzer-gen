    "intro": "Galium cinereum var. pubescens, commonly known as silverweed or white bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, often hairy stems that are typically prostrate or ascending, with opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, and its fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and is often found in disturbed soils. Galium cinereum var. pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
