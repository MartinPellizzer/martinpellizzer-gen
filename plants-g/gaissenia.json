    "intro": "Gaissenia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their palmate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. They produce showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Gaissenia species are often found in disturbed habitats and can sometimes become invasive in non-native areas."
