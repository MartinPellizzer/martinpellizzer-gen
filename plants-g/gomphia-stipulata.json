    "intro": "Gomphia stipulata, commonly known as the stipulate gomphia, is a rare and unique plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, and its roots are often used in traditional medicine. Gomphia stipulata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, loamy soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
