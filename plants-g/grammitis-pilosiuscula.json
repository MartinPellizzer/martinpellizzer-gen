    "intro": "Grammitis pilosiuscula, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in a dense layer of soft, brownish hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and form dense mats, which help it spread and colonize new areas. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, a common feature among ferns."
