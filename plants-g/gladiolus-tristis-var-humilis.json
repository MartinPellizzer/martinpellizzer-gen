    "intro": "Gladiolus tristis var. humilis, commonly known as the weedy gladiolus, is a lesser-known variant of the gladiolus genus. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa, characterized by its slender stems and small, pale flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has a fibrous root system. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. This variety is less ornamental than other gladiolus species but is of interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptability."
