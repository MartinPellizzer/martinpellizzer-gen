    "intro": "Grevillea pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered grevillea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in clusters, which are borne on slender, leafless stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Grevillea pauciflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing nectar for native pollinators."
