    "intro": "Grevillea dallachiana alba, commonly known as the white-stemmed grevillea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of fluffy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant collections. Grevillea dallachiana alba is also appreciated for its ability to attract native pollinators such as birds and insects."
