    "intro": "Glandularia fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered glandular verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and showy clusters of violet-blue flowers. The plant has glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive texture and help in reducing water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in arid landscapes."
