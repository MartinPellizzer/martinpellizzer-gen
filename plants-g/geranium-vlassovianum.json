    "intro": "Geranium vlassovianum, commonly known as the Siberian geranium, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Asia. It features upright stems that bear opposite, palmately lobed leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
