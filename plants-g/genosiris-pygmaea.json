    "intro": "Genosiris pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf genosiris, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often vibrant flowers. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, clustered leaves and delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Genosiris pygmaea is considered a vulnerable species."
