    "intro": "Goodyera hachijoensis, commonly known as the Hachijo Islands moss orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and delicate, nodding flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. This rare species is found exclusively on the Hachijo Islands, making it a unique and ecologically significant plant."
