    "intro": "Glandora prostrata var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored prostrate glandora, is a low-growing perennial plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and a contrasting white or pale underside. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it adaptable to arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in rocky or sandy soils."
