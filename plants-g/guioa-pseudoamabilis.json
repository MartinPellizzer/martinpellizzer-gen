    "intro": "Guioa pseudoamabilis, commonly known as the white guioa, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its lanceolate, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring or early summer. Its fruit is a globose capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Guioa pseudoamabilis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and as a street tree due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability."
