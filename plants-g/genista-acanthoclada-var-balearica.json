It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has compound leaves composed of several narrow, pointed leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
