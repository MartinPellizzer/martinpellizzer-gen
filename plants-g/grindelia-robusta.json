    "intro": "Grindelia robusta, commonly known as the desert composite or stickyhead, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant features narrow, silvery-green leaves with a sticky coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Grindelia robusta is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh desert conditions."
