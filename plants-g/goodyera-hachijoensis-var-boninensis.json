    "intro": "Goodyera hachijoensis var. boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the Bonin Islands. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces delicate, white to pale green flowers in a loose raceme. The plant has pleated leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on mossy rocks or tree trunks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
