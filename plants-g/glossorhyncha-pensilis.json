    "intro": "Glossorhyncha pensilis, commonly known as the hanging lip orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and its distinctive, pendulous flowers that resemble lips, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a short, fleshy spur at the base. Glossorhyncha pensilis typically grows in shaded, moist environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an intriguing subject for botanical study."
