    "intro": "Genista polyanthos, commonly known as the sweet pea shrub, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and clusters of small, fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces elongated, leathery pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in temperate climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
