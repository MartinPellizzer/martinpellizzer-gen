    "intro": "Galium pumilum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy wood-sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive pubescent (hairy) surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of white or yellow flowers, typically in spring, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grassy areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
