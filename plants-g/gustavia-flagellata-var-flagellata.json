    "intro": "Gustavia flagellata var. flagellata, commonly known as the long-leaf hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its long, slender, pendant-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and as a houseplant. The species is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it adaptable to various growing conditions."
