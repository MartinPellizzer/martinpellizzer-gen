    "intro": "Gynochthodes neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian starfish orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found exclusively in the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped inflorescence with brightly colored, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees in the dense, humid undergrowth. Its small, strap-like leaves are adapted to conserve moisture in its nutrient-poor environment. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is classified as critically endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
