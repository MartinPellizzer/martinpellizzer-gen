It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, often purple or violet-colored flowers. The plant typically produces a single, showy bloom that is adorned with intricate patterns and a distinct, elongated spur. Its botanical features include thick, fleshy leaves and a sturdy, erect stem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts."
