    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza duvia, commonly known as the Indian licorice, is a perennial herb native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into pods containing several seeds. Glycyrrhiza duvia is valued for its roots, which are used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties. However, it is less commonly cultivated compared to its relative, Glycyrrhiza glabra, due to its lower commercial demand."
