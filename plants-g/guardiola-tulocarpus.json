    "intro": "Guardiola tulocarpus, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green or golden yellow. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clusters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters near the base of the plant. The leaves are not only aesthetically pleasing but also serve as a habitat for various small insects and microorganisms."
