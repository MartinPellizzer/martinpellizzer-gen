    "intro": "Gronophyllum microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by small, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in arid or semi-arid conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in reforestation projects in its native region."
