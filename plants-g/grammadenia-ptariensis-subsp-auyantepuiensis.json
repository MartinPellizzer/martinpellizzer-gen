It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy orchid-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, humid environments at high altitudes. Its leaves are broad and succulent, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
