    "intro": "Glossopetalon spinescens var. meionandrum, commonly known as the small-flowered glossopetalon, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its overall appearance. This variant is distinguished by its reduced floral structures compared to the typical form of Glossopetalon spinescens. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
