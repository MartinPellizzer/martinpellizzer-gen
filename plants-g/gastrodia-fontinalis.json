    "intro": "Gastrodia fontinalis, commonly known as the spring gastrodia, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, pale green to yellowish leaves and its unique, fleshy, club-like structure that resembles a tuber. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. It produces a single, slender flower with a distinctive hooded lip and a greenish-yellow color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gastrodia fontinalis is considered a vulnerable species."
