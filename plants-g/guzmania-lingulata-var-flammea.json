    "intro": "Guzmania lingulata var. flammea, commonly known as the Flame-tipped Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, flame-like red bracts that surround its inflorescence, giving it a dramatic visual appeal. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small animals. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and bloom in the center of the rosette, adding to its ornamental value. Guzmania lingulata var. flammea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
