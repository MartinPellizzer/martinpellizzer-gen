It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and often have a waxy coating. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forests. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it recognizable in botanical collections. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
