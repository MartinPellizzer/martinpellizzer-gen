    "intro": "Gonocarpus paniculatus, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to red. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by water, aiding in its spread along shorelines. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in coastal ecosystems and a subject of study in botany and ecology."
