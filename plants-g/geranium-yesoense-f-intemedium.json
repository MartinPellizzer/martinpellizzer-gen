    "intro": "Geranium yesoense f. intemedium, commonly known as the Yesso geranium, is a rare and lesser-known botanical variant native to the Korean Peninsula. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with serrated margins and a hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
