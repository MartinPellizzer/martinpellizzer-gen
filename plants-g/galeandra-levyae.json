    "intro": "Galeandra levyae, commonly known as the Levite's orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its morphology includes narrow, strap-like leaves and a compact, pseudobulbous structure typical of many orchids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
