    "intro": "Gnaphalium liui, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to regions of Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Gnaphalium liui produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the summer months."
