    "intro": "Gentianella longicarpa, commonly known as the long-fruited gentian, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae, which is characterized by showy blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are often surrounded by glandular, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The fruit is a long, cylindrical capsule that matures in the fall, dispersing seeds through wind or animals."
