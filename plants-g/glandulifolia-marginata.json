    "intro": "Glandulifolia marginata, commonly known as the margined glandular plant, is a species characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. Its leaves are typically elongated with serrated margins and are covered in small, glandular structures that secrete various compounds. These glands contribute to the plant's ability to deter herbivores and retain moisture in arid environments. The flowers are usually small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink. This plant is native to certain regions of South America and is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
