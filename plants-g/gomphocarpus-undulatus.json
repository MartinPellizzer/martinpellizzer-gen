    "intro": "Gomphocarpus undulatus, commonly known as the zigzag milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsule-like fruits that release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing along roadsides and in disturbed soils. Gomphocarpus undulatus is part of the Apocynaceae family, which includes many plants with milky sap and showy flowers."
