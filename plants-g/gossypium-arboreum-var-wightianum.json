    "intro": "Gossypium arboreum var. wightianum, commonly known as the Wight's cotton tree, is a species of shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody stem, alternate leaves, and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a fibrous capsule, which is a key feature of the genus Gossypium. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm climate with adequate sunlight. This variety is less commonly cultivated for commercial cotton production compared to other Gossypium species."
