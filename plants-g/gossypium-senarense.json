    "intro": "Gossypium senarense, commonly known as the Senar\u00e9 cotton, is a lesser-known species of cotton native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and fluffy, white cotton fibers that are produced in the capsules of its flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in warm, humid climates with well-drained soils. Its fibrous structure is similar to other cotton species, but it is less commercially cultivated due to lower yields and fibrous quality. Despite its limited agricultural use, Gossypium senarense holds significance in botanical studies for its genetic diversity and ecological adaptations."
