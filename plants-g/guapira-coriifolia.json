It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden spaces. Guapira coriifolia is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
