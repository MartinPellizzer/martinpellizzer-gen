    "intro": "Gynura cacalioides, commonly known as the silverleaf gynura, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine white pubescence, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by oval-shaped, brownish seed pods. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Gynura cacalioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
