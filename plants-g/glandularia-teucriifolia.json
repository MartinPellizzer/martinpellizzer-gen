It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which contribute to its aromatic scent and help in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.
