    "intro": "Gymnocalycium andreae subsp. carolinense, commonly known as the Carolina moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived. Its succulent nature allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments with minimal water requirements. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance needs."
