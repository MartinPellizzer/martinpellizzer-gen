It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces showy, bright yellow flowers with prominent yellow stamens, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
