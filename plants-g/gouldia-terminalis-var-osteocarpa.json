    "intro": "Gouldia terminalis var. osteocarpa, commonly known as the coastal gouldia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and striking, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, showy flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal dunes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
