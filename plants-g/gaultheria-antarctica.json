    "intro": "Gaultheria antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark blue berries in the summer. These berries are edible and contain a high concentration of methyl salicylate, which gives them their distinctive wintergreen scent. Gaultheria antarctica is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous and subantarctic regions."
