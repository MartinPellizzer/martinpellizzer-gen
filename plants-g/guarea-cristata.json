    "intro": "Guarea cristata, commonly known as the crown-of-thorns or sacred tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, dark green leaves and distinctive, spiny fruit capsules that mature into red, fleshy berries. The plant belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes other hardwood trees known for their aromatic wood. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Guarea cristata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
