    "intro": "Geonoma leptostachys, commonly known as the slender-stalked geonoma, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous root system that helps anchor it in the soil. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
