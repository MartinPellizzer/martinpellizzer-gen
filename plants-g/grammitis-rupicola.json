    "intro": "Grammitis rupicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Grammitis rupicola plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
