    "intro": "Gambelia speciosa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and large, showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing its adaptation to harsh desert conditions. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Gambelia speciosa plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
