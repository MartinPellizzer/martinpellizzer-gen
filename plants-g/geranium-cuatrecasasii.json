    "intro": "Geranium cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's geranium, is a rare and unique species native to the Canary Islands. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The leaves are typically rounded and have a slightly hairy texture, while the stems are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
