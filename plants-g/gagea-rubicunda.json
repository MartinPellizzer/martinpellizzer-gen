    "intro": "Gagea rubicunda, commonly known as the redstem gagea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Its bulbs are underground and serve as storage organs, allowing the plant to survive harsh conditions. Gagea rubicunda is often found in rocky or open woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils."
