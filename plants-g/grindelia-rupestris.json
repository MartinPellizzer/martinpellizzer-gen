    "intro": "Grindelia rupestris, commonly known as desert gumweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as cliffs and slopes. The plant features silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small yellow flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Grindelia rupestris is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native range."
