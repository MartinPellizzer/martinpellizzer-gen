It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several minute seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along dunes and coastal bluffs, where it plays a role in stabilizing these dynamic environments."
