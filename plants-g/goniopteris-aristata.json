    "intro": "Goniopteris aristata, commonly known as the aristate spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rock surfaces or in shaded forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of its leaves. Goniopteris aristata is a small, epiphytic fern that plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
