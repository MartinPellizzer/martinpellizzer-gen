    "intro": "Gaylussacia affinis, commonly known as the common waxwing, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges, swamps, and thickets. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are white or pale green, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals. Its leaves are oval with a pointed tip and have a slightly rough texture. The shrub is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
