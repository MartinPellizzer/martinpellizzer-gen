    "intro": "Gonopyrum serotinum, commonly known as the late wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered at the base of the stems, with small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Gonopyrum serotinum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
