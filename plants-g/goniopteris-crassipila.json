    "intro": "Goniopteris crassipila, commonly known as the broad-veined water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds with broad, parallel veins. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it in wet soils. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing a lush appearance throughout the growing season."
