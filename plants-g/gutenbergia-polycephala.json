It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with finely divided, fern-like leaves. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
