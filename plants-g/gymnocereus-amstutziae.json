    "intro": "Gymnocereus amstutziae, commonly known as the Amstutz's night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the Mexican state of Sinaloa. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gymnocereus amstutziae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological importance in desert ecosystems."
