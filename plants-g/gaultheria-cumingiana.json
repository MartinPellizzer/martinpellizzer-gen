    "intro": "Gaultheria cumingiana, commonly known as the Cuming's wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by bright red berries that are highly aromatic. Its leaves contain methyl salicylate, giving the plant its characteristic wintergreen scent and making it notable for its medicinal and aromatic properties. Gaultheria cumingiana thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes."
