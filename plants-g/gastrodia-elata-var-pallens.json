    "intro": "Gastrodia elata var. pallens, commonly known as the pale gastrodia, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its underground tuberous structure, which is rich in starch and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine. The plant produces a single, showy white or pale yellow flower, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
