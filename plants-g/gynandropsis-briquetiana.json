It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system for water absorption. Gynandropsis briquetiana is also known for its milky sap, which is toxic and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
