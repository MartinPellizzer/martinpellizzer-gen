    "intro": "Geranium chamaedryfolium, commonly known as the alpine geranium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from cold temperatures and desiccation. Geranium chamaedryfolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and beauty."
