    "intro": "Gastrolychnis sordida, commonly known as the smoky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a slightly toxic reputation due to the presence of alkaloids. The fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when mature, often mistaken for edible plants but should be handled with care."
