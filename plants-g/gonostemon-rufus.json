It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially grown."
