    "intro": "Grammitis gracilis, commonly known as slender maidenhair fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
