It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is also noted for its role in supporting local pollinators and its potential medicinal properties."
