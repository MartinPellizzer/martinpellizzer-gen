    "intro": "Glechoma hymenodonta, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and small, spurred flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their mild diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
