    "intro": "Glyceria nutkaensis, commonly known as Nutka grass, is a perennial grass species native to western North America. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and lake shores. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets that are clustered at the base of the inflorescence. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Glyceria nutkaensis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
