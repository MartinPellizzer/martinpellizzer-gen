    "intro": "Goodenia heterotricha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf goodenia, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Goodenia heterotricha is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
