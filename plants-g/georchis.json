    "intro": "Georchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant belonging to the orchid family. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom on a slender stem. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Georchis thrives in specific, humid, and shaded environments, often found in the southeastern United States. Due to its limited habitat and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a threatened species."
