It is characterized by its dense, dark hardwood and slow growth rate, making it highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody fruits containing several seeds. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, Gonystylus nobilis is often considered a vulnerable species."
