    "intro": "Grewia sinuata, commonly known as the sour fig or red sour fig, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. The fruits are often consumed raw or used in jams and preserves due to their tart flavor. Grewia sinuata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in regions with low rainfall."
