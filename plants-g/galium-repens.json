    "intro": "Galium repens, commonly known as white bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Galium repens thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
