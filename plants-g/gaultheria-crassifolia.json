    "intro": "Gaultheria crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year, and its clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. Gaultheria crassifolia thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Its aromatic leaves contain methyl salicylate, which gives it a distinctive wintergreen scent."
