    "intro": "Gethyllis lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. The plant is characterized by its pale yellow or white flowers and a fibrous root system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is typically found in grasslands and open areas where its host species thrive. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
