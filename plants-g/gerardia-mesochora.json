    "intro": "Gerardia mesochora, commonly known as the mountain gerardia, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and the Pyrenees. It typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often in open, sunny habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems rise above the leaves, bearing small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. Gerardia mesochora is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes."
