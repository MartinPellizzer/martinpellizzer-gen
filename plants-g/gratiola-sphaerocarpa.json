    "intro": "Gratiola sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing above the water surface. The botanical features of Gratiola sphaerocarpa are adapted for both aquatic and terrestrial survival, making it a unique example of a carnivorous plant."
