    "intro": "Geranium maculatum, commonly known as the spotted geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features upright stems with heart-shaped leaves that have a distinctive red or purple spot at the base. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded to partially shaded areas. Geranium maculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
