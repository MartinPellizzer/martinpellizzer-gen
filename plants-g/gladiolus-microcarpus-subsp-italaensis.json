    "intro": "Gladiolus microcarpus subsp. italaensis, commonly known as the Italaensis gladiolus, is a rare and compact member of the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short, erect stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
