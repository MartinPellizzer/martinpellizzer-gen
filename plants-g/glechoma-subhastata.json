    "intro": "Glechoma subhastata, commonly known as the creeping ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy underside and small, fragrant blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant spreads via runners, forming dense mats that can cover the ground effectively. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its medicinal properties have been traditionally used for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects."
