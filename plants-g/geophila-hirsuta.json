    "intro": "Geophila hirsuta, commonly known as hairy false forget-me-not, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It features a mat-forming habit with slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic hirsute appearance. Geophila hirsuta thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
