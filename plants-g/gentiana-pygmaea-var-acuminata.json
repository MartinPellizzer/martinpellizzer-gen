    "intro": "Gentiana pygmaea var. acuminata, commonly known as the acuminata gentian, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the high elevations of the Appalachian Mountains. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or wooded areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
