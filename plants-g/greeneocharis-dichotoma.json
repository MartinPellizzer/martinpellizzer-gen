    "intro": "Greeneocharis dichotoma, commonly known as the forked greenbriar, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems that branch dichotomously, forming a dense, thorny structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, red berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Greeneocharis dichotoma is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open woodlands."
