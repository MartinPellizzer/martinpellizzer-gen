    "intro": "Gliricidia, commonly known as the madhuca or callerya, is a fast-growing legume native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features compound leaves with an odd number of leaflets, typically ranging from 10 to 20, and produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its seeds are encased in pods and can remain viable for several years, aiding in its spread. Gliricidia is often used in agroforestry and as a source of fodder due to its high nutritional value."
