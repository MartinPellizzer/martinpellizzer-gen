    "intro": "Genistidium dumosum, commonly known as the shrubby broom, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical pea-like flowers and compound leaves. The plant features a sprawling growth habit with woody stems that produce dense clusters of yellow flowers in early spring. Its small, trifoliate leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Genistidium dumosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal and dryland soils."
