    "intro": "Galium scabriusculum subsp. protoscabriusculum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically features slender, ascending stems covered in fine, stiff hairs, which give it its \"scabriusculum\" name meaning \"rough little.\" The leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy surface. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is often found in moist, open habitats such as woodland edges and stream banks."
