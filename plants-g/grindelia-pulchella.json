    "intro": "Grindelia pulchella, commonly known as the showy goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers and silvery, fuzzy foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Grindelia pulchella is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine by some Native American tribes."
