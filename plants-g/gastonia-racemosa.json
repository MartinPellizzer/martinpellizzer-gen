    "intro": "Gastonia racemosa, commonly known as the clustered holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, with spiny margins. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
