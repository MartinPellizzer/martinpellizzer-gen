    "intro": "Gentiana yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in forests or meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, while its stems are upright and branched. Gentiana yunnanensis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its traditional medicinal uses in Chinese herbal medicine."
