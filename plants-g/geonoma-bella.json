    "intro": "Geonoma bella, commonly known as the beautiful geonoma, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, delicate fronds that often have a lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understories of dense vegetation. Its rhizomes are often covered in a fine, hairy layer, which helps in water retention. Geonoma bella is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
