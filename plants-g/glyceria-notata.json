It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight reddish or purple tint. Glyceria notata plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
