    "intro": "Guariruma sinuatum, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in the humid environment. Guariruma sinuatum plays a role in the ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
