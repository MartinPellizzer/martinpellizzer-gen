    "intro": "Gnaphalium quintuplinerve, commonly known as the five-veined cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces tiny, yellowish to white flower heads that are clustered in dense, fluffy inflorescences. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. Due to its delicate appearance and ability to colonize various habitats, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
