    "intro": "Galium mollugo var. petraeum, commonly known as the alpine bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky soils and woodland areas. The plant features slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and usually have a slightly hairy texture. This variant is distinguished by its adaptability to alpine conditions and its role in supporting local insect populations."
