It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet, featuring upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a slightly hairy texture. Geranium retrorsum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
