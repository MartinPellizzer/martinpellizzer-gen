    "intro": "Gossypium hirsutum var. religiosum, commonly known as the sacred cotton, is a variety of upland cotton native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its fibrous, fluffy seeds that are often associated with religious and ceremonial practices among indigenous communities. The plant produces bright yellow flowers and has a hairy stem, typical of the Gossypium genus. Its fibers are valued not only for their textile properties but also for their cultural and spiritual significance. This variety is less commonly cultivated commercially compared to other cotton types due to its limited yield and specific growing requirements."
