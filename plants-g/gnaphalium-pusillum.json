    "intro": "Gnaphalium pusillum, commonly known as the small white cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. It is known for its ability to produce a fine, powdery substance from its flower heads, which can be easily dispersed by wind. Gnaphalium pusillum is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in various habitats."
