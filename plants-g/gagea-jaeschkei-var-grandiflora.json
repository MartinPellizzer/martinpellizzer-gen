    "intro": "Gagea jaeschkei var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered gagea, is a rare and striking member of the Liliaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to the mountainous regions of central China, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its bulbs are small and often overlooked, but they play a crucial role in its survival and reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
