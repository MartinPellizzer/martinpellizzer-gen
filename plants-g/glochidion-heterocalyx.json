    "intro": "Glochidion heterocalyx, commonly known as the white-flowered glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by a fleshy, cup-shaped structure called a cyathium. Glochidion heterocalyx is typically found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal. It is also used in traditional medicine in some regions for its purported healing properties."
