    "intro": "Gouldia terminalis var. pseudodichotoma, commonly known as the pink ghost flower, is a striking member of the orchid family native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spiraling arrangement of pink and white petals that resemble a ghostly apparition. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a compact, cushion-like growth habit. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
