    "intro": "Gleichenia retroflexa, commonly known as the creeping wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, elongated shape that often forms dense mats on the forest floor. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
