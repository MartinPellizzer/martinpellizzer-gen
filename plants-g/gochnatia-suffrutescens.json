    "intro": "Gochnatia suffrutescens, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody, often thorny stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its fruit is a capsule containing small, hard seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resistance to drought and poor soil conditions. Gochnatia suffrutescens is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
