    "intro": "Gladiolus curtifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gladiolus, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features sword-shaped leaves that are narrower than those of other gladiolus species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, upright stems that bear clusters of showy, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. Due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements, it is often cultivated for its vibrant blooms."
