    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea f. niphobia, commonly known as the snow leek, is a rare and alpine plant characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. It produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear white to pale pink, tubular flowers arranged in a spike. The plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements."
