    "intro": "Globularia nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stem globularia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a compact, globe-shaped rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
