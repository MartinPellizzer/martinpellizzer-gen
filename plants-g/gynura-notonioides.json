    "intro": "Gynura notonioides, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silver vine, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Gynura notonioides is also popular as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage."
