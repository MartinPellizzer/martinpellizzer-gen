    "intro": "Gymnanthes multiramea, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, fleshy fruits containing several seeds. Gymnanthes multiramea is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used for furniture and carving. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
