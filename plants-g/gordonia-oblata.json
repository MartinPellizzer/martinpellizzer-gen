    "intro": "Gordonia oblata, commonly known as the white-barked beech, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by clusters of red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are oval-shaped with smooth edges and turn yellow in the fall. Gordonia oblata is often found in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments."
