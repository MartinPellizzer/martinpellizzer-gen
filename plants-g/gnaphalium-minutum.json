    "intro": "Gnaphalium minutum, commonly known as the common cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features small, narrow leaves arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces tiny, fluffy flower heads that are often mistaken for seeds, which are actually composite flowers consisting of many tiny florets. Its flowers are usually yellow or whitish and bloom from late spring to early autumn. Gnaphalium minutum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, and it is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
