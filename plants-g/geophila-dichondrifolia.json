    "intro": "Geophila dichondrifolia, commonly known as the creeping bluebell, is a herbaceous perennial native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features slender, rhizomatous stems that spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Geophila dichondrifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
