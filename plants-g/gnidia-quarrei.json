    "intro": "Gnidia quarrei, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by small, round fruits that are edible for some bird species. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Gnidia quarrei is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
