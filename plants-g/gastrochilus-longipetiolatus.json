    "intro": "Gastrochilus longipetiolatus, commonly known as the long-petioled stomach lip, is a rare orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated petioles and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a unique lip structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
