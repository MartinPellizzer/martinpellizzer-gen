    "intro": "Galatella sedifolia subsp. biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, often blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
