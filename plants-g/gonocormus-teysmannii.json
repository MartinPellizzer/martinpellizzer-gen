    "intro": "Gonocormus teysmannii, commonly known as the Teyssmann's ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with translucent, waxy leaves and pale greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in montane forests. It has small, clustered roots that anchor it to tree bark or moss-covered substrates. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered."
