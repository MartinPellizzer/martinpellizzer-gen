    "intro": "Gymnogramma chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapan gymnogramma, is a species of fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are covered in small, scale-like structures. Gymnogramma chiapensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
