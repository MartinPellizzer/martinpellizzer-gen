    "intro": "Galium umbellatum var. scabrifolium, commonly known as roughleaf bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features slender, branched stems that often lie prostrate or ascend, covered in fine, stiff hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough, sandpapery texture along the margins, giving it its common name. Small white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
