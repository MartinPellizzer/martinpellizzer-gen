    "intro": "Galinsoga ciliata, commonly known as common galinsoga, is an annual herb native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves with fine, hairy margins. The plant produces numerous tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, spiny fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a weed in many regions."
