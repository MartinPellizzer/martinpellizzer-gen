    "intro": "Graphorkis filicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed marsh orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in eastern Australia. It features a short, horizontal rhizome with a single, erect flowering stem that bears a few showy, greenish-white to pale yellow flowers. The leaves are narrow and strap-like, often with a waxy coating, and are arranged along the stem. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
