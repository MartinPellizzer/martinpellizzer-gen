    "intro": "Geranium reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that are often hairy and bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with intricate net-like veins. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or purple, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
