    "intro": "Gentiana humilis var. albescens, commonly known as the white gentian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking blue to sky-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it tolerates cool, temperate climates. This variety is distinguished by its pale or white flowers, which contrast with the more typical blue hues of other gentian species."
