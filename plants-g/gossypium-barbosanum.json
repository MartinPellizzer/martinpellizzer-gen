    "intro": "Gossypium barbosanum, commonly known as the Barbosa cotton, is a species of cotton native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fluffy, white fibers that are used for textile production, similar to other cotton species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its genetic diversity, it is also of interest for breeding programs aimed at improving cotton resilience and yield."
