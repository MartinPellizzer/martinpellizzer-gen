    "intro": "Gilia abrotanifolia, commonly known as the plains gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It has slender, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Gilia abrotanifolia plays a role in supporting local ecosystems and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its adaptability to arid conditions."
