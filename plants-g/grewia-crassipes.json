    "intro": "Grewia crassipes, commonly known as the roughleaf grewia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, round, orange fruits that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for dry climates. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and wildlife habitat."
