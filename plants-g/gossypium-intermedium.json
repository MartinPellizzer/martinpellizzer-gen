    "intro": "Gossypium intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate cotton, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, broad ovate leaves, and showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its cotton-like fibers, though not commercially valuable, are used in some traditional crafts. Gossypium intermedium plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various insects and small animals."
