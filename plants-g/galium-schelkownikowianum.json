    "intro": "Galium schelkownikowianum, commonly known as the Schelkunov's bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
