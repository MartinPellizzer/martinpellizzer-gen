    "intro": "Goodyera affinis, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and its unique, spurred, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments and is often found in association with other orchids. Goodyera affinis is known for its ability to form dense colonies, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
