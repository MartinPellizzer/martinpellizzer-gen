    "intro": "Genista stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited broom, is a flowering plant in the Fabaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, narrow pods containing seeds. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and slender, often spiny stems. Genista stenocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
