    "intro": "Gentiana sikokiana f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered gentian, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South Korea. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its bright white to pale blue flowers, which contrast sharply with its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
