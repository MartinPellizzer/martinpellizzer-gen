    "intro": "Grubovia krylowii, commonly known as the Krylov's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
