    "intro": "Gnaphalium obconicum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Gnaphalium obconicum is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued as a ornamental plant for its long-lasting flowers."
