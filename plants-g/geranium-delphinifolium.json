    "intro": "Geranium delphinifolium, commonly known as the sea geranium, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, saline soils. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Geranium delphinifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic value."
