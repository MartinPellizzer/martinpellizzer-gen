    "intro": "Guzmania jaramilloi, commonly known as the Jaramillo's torch plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Colombia and is characterized by its striking, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms. Its flowers, which are typically red or orange, bloom in the center of the rosette and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Guzmania jaramilloi is a popular ornamental plant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
