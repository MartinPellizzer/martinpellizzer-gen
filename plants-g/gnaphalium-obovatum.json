    "intro": "Gnaphalium obovatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are broad and oval-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Gnaphalium obovatum is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting flowers and delicate appearance."
