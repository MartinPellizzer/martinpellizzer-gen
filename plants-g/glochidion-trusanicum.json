    "intro": "Glochidion trusanicum, commonly known as the Trusanic glabrous wood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
