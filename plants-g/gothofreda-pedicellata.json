    "intro": "Gothofreda pedicellata, commonly known as the moonlight bellflower, is a rare flowering plant characterized by its unique, bell-shaped blooms that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. Native to the misty highlands of the Andes, it thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil. The plant features slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are pollinated primarily by nocturnal moths and bats. Due to its endangered status, conservation efforts are underway to protect this ethereal species from habitat loss."
