    "intro": "Gypsophila scabra, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Gypsophila scabra is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
