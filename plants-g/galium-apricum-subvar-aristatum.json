    "intro": "Galium apricum subvar. aristatum, commonly known as the arrow-leaved bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are lanceolate to ovate, with a distinctive pointed tip, and are usually arranged alternately along the stem. Small white or pale yellow flowers appear in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
