    "intro": "Grammitis subrepanda, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a leathery texture, which helps reduce water loss. Grammitis subrepanda is often found in shaded, humid environments, making it a common sight in rainforests."
