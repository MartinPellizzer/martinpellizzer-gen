    "intro": "Grevillea glabrata subsp. dissectifolia, commonly known as the dissected grevillea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often deeply divided, giving the plant a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid environments."
