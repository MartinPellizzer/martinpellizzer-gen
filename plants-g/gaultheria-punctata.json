    "intro": "Gaultheria punctata, commonly known as the spotted wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with white or silver speckles, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, aromatic flavor, often used in culinary applications. Gaultheria punctata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist woodland environments."
