    "intro": "Glechoma parnassica, commonly known as the alpine ground-ivy, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Glechoma parnassica thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its ability to tolerate cold climates makes it a hardy species well adapted to high-altitude ecosystems."
