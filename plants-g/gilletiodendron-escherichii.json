    "intro": "Gilletiodendron escherichii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and beauty. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range."
