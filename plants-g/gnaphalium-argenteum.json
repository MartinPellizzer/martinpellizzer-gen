    "intro": "Gnaphalium argenteum, commonly known as silverleaf cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
