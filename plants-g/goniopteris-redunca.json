    "intro": "Goniopteris redunca, commonly known as the redunca fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, intricate frond structure with a central rib and multiple pinnae, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks. The fronds are typically bright green, with a waxy surface that helps protect the plant from excessive moisture loss."
