    "intro": "Gleichenia speluncae var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular Gleichenia, is a rare fern species native to subterranean environments. It thrives in dark, humid cave systems where it relies on limited light and moisture for survival. The plant's leaves are typically elongated and have a distinct glandular texture, which may aid in water retention. It is characterized by its unique morphology, including specialized structures adapted to its cave habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
