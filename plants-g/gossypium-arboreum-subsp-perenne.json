    "intro": "Gossypium arboreum subsp. perenne, commonly known as the perennial tree cotton, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family. It is native to tropical regions of South America and is characterized by its woody stem and broad, palmate leaves. The plant produces fluffy, white cotton-like fibers that are harvested from its capsules. It is adapted to grow in warm, humid climates and is often found in secondary forests or disturbed areas. Due to its fibrous characteristics, it has been studied for potential use in textile production."
