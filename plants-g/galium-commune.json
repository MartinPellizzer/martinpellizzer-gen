    "intro": "Galium commune, commonly known as common bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Galium commune is commonly found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils."
