It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with thin, wiry stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
