    "intro": "Gnaphalium cymatoides, commonly known as the hairy leaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by fluffy, white to pale pink seed heads. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often used in dried floral arrangements due to its long-lasting, fluffy appearance."
