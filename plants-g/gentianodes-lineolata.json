    "intro": "Gentianodes lineolata, commonly known as the narrow-veined gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their striking blue or purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
