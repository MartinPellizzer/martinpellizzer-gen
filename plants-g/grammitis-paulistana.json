    "intro": "Grammitis paulistana, commonly known as the Brazilian wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has slender, wiry fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hair. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis paulistana thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests."
