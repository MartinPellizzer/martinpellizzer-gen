    "intro": "Gomphandra scorpioidea, commonly known as the sword fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, sword-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in the substrate. The fronds are often divided into segments, with the upper parts being more delicate and the lower parts more robust."
