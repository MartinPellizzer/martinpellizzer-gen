    "intro": "Goldbachia sabulosa, commonly known as the sandstone aster, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of purple and white, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration. Goldbachia sabulosa plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
