    "intro": "Gastrodia procera, commonly known as the giant club-moss, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Podostomata and is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a thick, fleshy rhizome and small, scale-like leaves. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments, often found in dense forests. Gastrodia procera is also recognized for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies for its purported health benefits. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
