    "intro": "Grammitis limbata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperborean, is a fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Grammitis limbata plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
