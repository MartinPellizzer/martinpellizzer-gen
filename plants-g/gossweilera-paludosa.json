    "intro": "Gossweilera paludosa, commonly known as the marsh mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features elongated, hairy stems that grow from a rhizomatous base, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention. Gossweilera paludosa is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in consistently moist to waterlogged soils."
