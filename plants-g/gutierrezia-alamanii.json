    "intro": "Gutierrezia alamanii, commonly known as desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the aster family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellowish-green flowers and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh desert conditions. It produces small, composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gutierrezia alamanii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
