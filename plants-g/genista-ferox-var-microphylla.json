It features small, spiny leaves and produces bright orange-yellow flowers in late spring. The plant is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and is often used in hedges or as a decorative plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for gardeners in Mediterranean climates."
