    "intro": "Gahnia subaequiglumis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, clumped growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along waterways. Gahnia subaequiglumis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
