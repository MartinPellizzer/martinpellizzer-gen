    "intro": "Geranium pratense subsp. sylvaticum, commonly known as the woodland geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and stream sides, preferring rich, loamy soils. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough texture and a slightly hairy surface. The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and smaller flowers compared to the main species."
