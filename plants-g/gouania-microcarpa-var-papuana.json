    "intro": "Gouania microcarpa var. papuana, commonly known as the Papuan gouania, is a small shrub native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
