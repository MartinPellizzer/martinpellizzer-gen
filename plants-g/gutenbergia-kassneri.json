    "intro": "Gutenbergia kassneri, commonly known as the Kassner's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale green leaves and delicate, white or pale yellow flowers that resemble translucent petals. The plant is a terrestrial orchid, growing in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, and it is pollinated by specific insect species, making it highly dependent on its ecological niche. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gutenbergia kassneri is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts to protect its survival."
