    "intro": "Gesneria shaferi subsp. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf gesneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features broad, dark green leaves that are often variegated with silver or white markings, adding visual interest to its foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
