    "intro": "Genista ramosissima, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its slender, branched stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and Mediterranean regions. Due to its invasive tendencies in some areas, it is sometimes considered a weed."
