    "intro": "Grammitis totta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form dense, carpet-like growths on trees. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in lines on the underside of the leaves. Grammitis totta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
