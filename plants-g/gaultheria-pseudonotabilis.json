    "intro": "Gaultheria pseudonotabilis, commonly known as the Andean wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and rhododendrons. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by dark blue berries that are edible. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed, similar to wintergreen. Gaultheria pseudonotabilis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude regions with well-drained soil."
