It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant leaves that emit a distinctive vanilla-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. Due to its medicinal and ornamental uses, it has been historically cultivated for its unique fragrance and potential health benefits."
