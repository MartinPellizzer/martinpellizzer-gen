    "intro": "Gentianella paludosa, commonly known as the bog gentian, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in peat bogs and damp meadows, where it thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are basal, opposite, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Gentianella paludosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in maintaining wetland biodiversity."
