It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is often found in chaparral and scrub habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
