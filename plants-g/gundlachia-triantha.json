    "intro": "Gundlachia triantha, commonly known as the three-lobed sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, three-lobed leaves and has a compact growth habit, making it well adapted to its native habitat. Gundlachia triantha is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
