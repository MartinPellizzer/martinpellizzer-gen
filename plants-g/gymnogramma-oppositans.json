It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the lower leaf surfaces. Gymnogramma oppositans is characterized by its delicate fronds and is often found in forest understories across tropical and subtropical regions."
