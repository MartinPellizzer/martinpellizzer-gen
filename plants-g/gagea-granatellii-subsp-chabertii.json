    "intro": "Gagea granatellii subsp. chabertii, commonly known as the Chabert's spring beauty, is a rare and delicate bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are grass-like and appear after the flowers, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
