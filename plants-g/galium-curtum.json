It typically features slender, ascending stems that are often hairy and have a faintly aromatic scent. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a lanceolate or ovate shape with finely serrated edges. Galium curtum is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
