The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowering period is associated with moist, well-drained soils in woodland or alpine habitats. Gentiana longiflora is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, showy blooms."
