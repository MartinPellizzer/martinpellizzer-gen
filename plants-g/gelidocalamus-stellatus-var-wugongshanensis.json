    "intro": "Gelidocalamus stellatus var. wugongshanensis, commonly known as the Wugongshan bamboo, is a rare and endemic plant species native to China. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection."
