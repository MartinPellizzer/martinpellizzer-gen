    "intro": "Guzmania crispa, commonly known as the pinky guzmania, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that often displays shades of red, pink, and purple. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater in a central cup, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its foliage is typically green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. Guzmania crispa is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
