    "intro": "Galium pumilum subsp. pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats with small, opposite leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its stems are prostrate or ascending, often rooting at the nodes to form a spreading vegetation. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and mountain meadows."
