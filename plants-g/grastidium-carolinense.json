    "intro": "Grastidium carolinense, commonly known as the Carolina grassvetch, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, oval legumes that contain seeds, and it plays a minor role in local ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat overlooked species."
