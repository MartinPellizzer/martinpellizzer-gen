    "intro": "Gomphia stipulacea var. pentandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gomphia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to fire-prone environments. The plant is characterized by its narrow, strap-shaped leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. It typically grows in open, sandy soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
