It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
