    "intro": "Grindelia neomexicana, commonly known as desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Grindelia neomexicana is also known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which can deter herbivores."
