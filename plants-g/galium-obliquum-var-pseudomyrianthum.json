    "intro": "Galium obliquum var. pseudomyrianthum, commonly known as the false myrianthum bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and opposite, ovate leaves with slightly hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in cymes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This variant is distinguished from the typical Galium obliquum by its unique floral structure and slightly different leaf morphology."
