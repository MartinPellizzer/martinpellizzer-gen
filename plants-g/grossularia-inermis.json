    "intro": "Grossularia inermis, commonly known as the snowball viburnum, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically red or yellow when mature. It thrives in cooler climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland borders."
