    "intro": "Gleditsia vestita, commonly known as the honey locust, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 12 to 24 inches long and consist of 15 to 30 small, oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a distinctive flaky texture that becomes more pronounced with age. The honey locust is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
