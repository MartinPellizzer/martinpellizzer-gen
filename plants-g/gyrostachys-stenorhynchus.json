    "intro": "Gyrostachys stenorhynchus, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round berries. It is well adapted to the dry, coastal environments of Hawaii, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
