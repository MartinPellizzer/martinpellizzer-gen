    "intro": "Genipa pavetta, commonly known as the red bell pepper tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that mature to a bright red color, often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye. Its botanical features include opposite leaf arrangement and the presence of stipules, which are small leaf-like structures at the base of the leaves. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
