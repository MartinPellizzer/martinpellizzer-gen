    "intro": "Gastrodia, commonly known as the thunder god's orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique underground tubers and lack of true leaves, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. The plant is native to Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in shaded, humid environments. Gastrodia species are often found in forest floors and are known for their medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine. Its flowers are typically small, greenish, and lack showy petals, making it less conspicuous than other orchids."
