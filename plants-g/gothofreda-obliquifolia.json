    "intro": "Gothofreda obliquifolia, commonly known as the slant-leaf ghostplant, is a rare and delicate member of the Pteridophyta division, specifically within the order Equisetales. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, needle-like leaves that curve at an angle, giving it its scientific name. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in specialized leaf-like structures called sporophylls. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Gothofreda obliquifolia is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
