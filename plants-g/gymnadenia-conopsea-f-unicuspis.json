    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea f. unicuspis, commonly known as the single-cusp orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species characterized by its unique floral morphology. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to specific regions of Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces striking, pale pink to white flowers with a single, elongated lip. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements. This orchid is of particular interest to botanists due to its genetic distinctiveness and conservation status."
