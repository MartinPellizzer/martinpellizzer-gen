The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and are followed by small, woody pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and resilient plant, well-suited to Mediterranean climates."
