    "intro": "Glyptopetalum longipedicellatum, commonly known as the long-stalked starflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and produces small, green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
