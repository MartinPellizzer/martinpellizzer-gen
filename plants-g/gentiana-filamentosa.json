    "intro": "Gentiana filamentosa, commonly known as the filament gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a silvery-blue hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Gentiana filamentosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
