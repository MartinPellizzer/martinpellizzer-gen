    "intro": "Gymnocalycium parvulum subsp. amoenum, commonly known as the Amoenum Cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Argentina. It features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
