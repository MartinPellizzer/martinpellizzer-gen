    "intro": "Galium jordanii var. scabridum, commonly known as Jordan's bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often hairy stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a slightly rough texture, contributing to its scientific name \"scabridum,\" which refers to its rough or scaly surface. Galium jordanii var. scabridum is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
