    "intro": "Gymnosporia senegalensis var. stuhlmanniana, commonly known as the Stuhlmann's African burr, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its woody stem and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by spiny, globe-shaped fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry savannas and woodland areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of fuelwood."
