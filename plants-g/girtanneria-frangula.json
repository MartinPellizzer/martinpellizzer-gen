    "intro": "Girtanneria frangula, commonly known as common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, black berries that are rich in anthraquinones. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types and environmental conditions. It is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed sites. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
