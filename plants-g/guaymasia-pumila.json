    "intro": "Guaymasia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf guaymasia, is a small, flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
