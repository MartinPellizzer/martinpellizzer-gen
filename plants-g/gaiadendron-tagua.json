    "intro": "Gaiadendron tagua, commonly known as the ivory nut or tagua, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody, palm-like appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a hard, woody capsule that contains a single seed, which is often used as a substitute for ivory due to its smooth, pale appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests."
