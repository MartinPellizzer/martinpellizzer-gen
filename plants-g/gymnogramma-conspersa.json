    "intro": "Gymnogramma conspersa, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are borne on the underside of the fertile fronds, which are usually smaller and more compact than the sterile ones."
