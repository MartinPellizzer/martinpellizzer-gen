    "intro": "Geblera tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geblera, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value. Geblera tenuifolia is known for its relatively slow growth and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
