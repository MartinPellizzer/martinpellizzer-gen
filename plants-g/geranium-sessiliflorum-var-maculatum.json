It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often with a distinctive white or red spot at the base of each petal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valued addition to both wild and cultivated landscapes."
