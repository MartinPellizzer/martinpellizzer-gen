    "intro": "Gymnadenia delavayi, commonly known as Delavay's grass-pink, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Gymnadenia delavayi is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
