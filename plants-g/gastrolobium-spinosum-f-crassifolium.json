    "intro": "Gastrolobium spinosum f. crassifolium, commonly known as the thick-leaved spear-leaf wattle, is a variant of the native Australian shrub Gastrolobium spinosum. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often broader and more robust than those of the typical form. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. It is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils in arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia. This subspecies is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in dryland landscaping due to its hardy nature."
