    "intro": "Grona heterocarpos subsp. heterocarpos, commonly known as the narrowleaf grona, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
