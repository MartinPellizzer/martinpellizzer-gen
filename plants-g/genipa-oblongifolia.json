It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles. The tree is notable for its unique fruit, which is typically harvested when it turns a bright red color, indicating ripeness. The fruit has a hard, woody exterior and a sweet, aromatic pulp that is often used in traditional beverages and culinary applications. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its ecological benefits in native habitats."
