    "intro": "Goniophlebium argutum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It features small, submerged or floating leaves that often have a bladders-like structure used to trap aquatic prey. The plant's stems are typically hairy and robust, adapted to its aquatic habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or yellowish in color. Goniophlebium argutum plays a role in its ecosystem by controlling populations of small aquatic organisms."
