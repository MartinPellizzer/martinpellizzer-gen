    "intro": "Ginkgo biloba f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf ginkgo, is a unique variant of the ginkgo tree characterized by its smaller, more delicate leaves compared to the standard ginkgo. This cultivar is known for its distinctive fan-shaped leaves that turn a striking yellow in autumn. It is a male-only form, meaning it does not produce fruit, making it a preferred choice for urban landscaping due to the absence of messy fruit litter. The plant is native to China and is valued for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities. Its ancient lineage and resilience make it a popular choice in botanical gardens and parks worldwide."
