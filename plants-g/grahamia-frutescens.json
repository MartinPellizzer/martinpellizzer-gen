    "intro": "Grahamia frutescens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale green, leafless stems and its single, showy white or pale pink flower. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its stems for photosynthesis, making it highly specialized. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees in swampy areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
