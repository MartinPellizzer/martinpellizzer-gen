    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza glabra var. caduca, commonly known as the deciduous licorice, is a variant of the licorice plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and pinnately compound leaves that turn yellow and drop in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in racemes, followed by pods containing several seeds. Its roots, similar to the common licorice, are rich in glycyrrhizin and other compounds. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
