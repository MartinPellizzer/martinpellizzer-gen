It is characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescence and vibrant, colorful flowers that range from purple to yellow. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or in the undergrowth. Its flowers are highly specialized, with intricate structures that facilitate pollination by specific insect species.
