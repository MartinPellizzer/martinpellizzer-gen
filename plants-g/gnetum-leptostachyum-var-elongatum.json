    "intro": "Gnetum leptostachyum var. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated gnetum, is a member of the Gnetophyta class, characterized by its unique combination of gymnosperm and angiosperm traits. It is a woody plant with a distinctive morphology, featuring compound leaves and a branching stem structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers, which are typically unisexual and arranged in catkin-like inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, three-lobed aril, a feature that aids in seed dispersal. This variant is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
