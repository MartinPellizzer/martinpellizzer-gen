    "intro": "Gouldia ovata var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable gouldia, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that range in color from red to orange and yellow, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant typically grows in a clumping form, with narrow, grass-like leaves that provide a textured contrast to the colorful bracts. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is often used in rock gardens or as a container plant."
