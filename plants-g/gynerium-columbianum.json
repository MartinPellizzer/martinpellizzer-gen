    "intro": "Gynerium columbianum, commonly known as the Columbian water flea, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish itself in suitable habitats. Gynerium columbianum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
