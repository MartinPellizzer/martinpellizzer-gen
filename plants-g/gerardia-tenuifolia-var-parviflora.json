    "intro": "Gerardia tenuifolia var. parviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gerardia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun conditions. It is often found in alpine environments where it contributes to the local flora. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
