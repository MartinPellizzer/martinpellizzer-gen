    "intro": "Galium ellipticum f. ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaved bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender stems that often lie prostrate or ascend, covered in fine, soft hairs. The leaves are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a slightly toothed margin, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Small white or pale green flowers appear in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
