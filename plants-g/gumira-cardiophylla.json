    "intro": "Gumira cardiophylla, commonly known as the heartleaf gumira, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinct heart-shaped leaves. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are glossy and often have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. The flowers are usually small, tubular, and come in shades of pink or white, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
