    "intro": "Galium pumilum var. glabrum, commonly known as smooth bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrum is distinguished by its smoother, hairless surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or stream banks. Its flowering stems are usually prostrate or ascending, and it is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
