    "intro": "Genista sepiaria, commonly known as the coastal broom, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to coastal environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Genista sepiaria is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
