    "intro": "Gaylussacia oleifolia, commonly known as the wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, aromatic, elliptical leaves that turn a striking red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and forest edges. Its dense growth habit makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
