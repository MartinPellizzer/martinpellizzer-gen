    "intro": "Gothofreda kuntzei, commonly known as the Kuntze's ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shaded, rocky habitats. The plant has a short stem with few leaves, and its flowers are typically small and clustered, giving it a ghostly appearance. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is known for its unique morphology and limited distribution. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
