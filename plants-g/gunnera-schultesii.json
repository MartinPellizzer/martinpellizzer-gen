    "intro": "Gunnera schultesii, commonly known as the giant rhubarb, is a striking plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in diameter, with a deeply lobed structure. The plant belongs to the Gunneraceae family and is known for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to high-altitude environments. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific growing conditions to thrive."
