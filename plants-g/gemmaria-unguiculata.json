    "intro": "Gemmaria unguiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gemmaria, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Gemmaria unguiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny landscapes."
