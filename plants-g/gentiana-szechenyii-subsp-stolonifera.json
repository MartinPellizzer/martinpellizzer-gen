    "intro": "Gentiana szechenyii subsp. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its stoloniferous growth habit, which involves the production of horizontal stems that can give rise to new shoots. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky slopes. The plant's ornamental value has made it a subject of interest in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in cultivation."
