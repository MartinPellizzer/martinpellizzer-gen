    "intro": "Gymnogramma lanata, commonly known as the hairy gymnogramma, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats over time. Gymnogramma lanata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
