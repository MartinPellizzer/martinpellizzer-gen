It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Goswamia is native to South and Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is known for its stinging hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact."
