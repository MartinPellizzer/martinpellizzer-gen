    "intro": "Gymnanthes glabrata, commonly known as the smooth gymnanthes, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Gymnanthes glabrata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in the wild."
