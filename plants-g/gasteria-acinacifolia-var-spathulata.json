It features thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are broad and oval in shape, often with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
