    "intro": "Galactia formosa, commonly known as the showy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial legume belonging to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Galactia formosa is often found in grasslands, rocky slopes, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
