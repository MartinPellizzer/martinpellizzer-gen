    "intro": "Gyrostachys porrifolia, commonly known as the leafy mustard, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb with alternate, pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. Its seeds are enclosed in a siliqua, a type of dry, dehiscent fruit. Gyrostachys porrifolia is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
