    "intro": "Gaultheria multiglandulosa, commonly known as the red-flowered wintergreen, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, dark red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces aromatic leaves that contain methyl salicylate, a compound responsible for its distinctive wintergreen scent. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. Gaultheria multiglandulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
