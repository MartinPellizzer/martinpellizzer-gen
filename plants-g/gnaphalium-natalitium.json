    "intro": "Gnaphalium natalitium, commonly known as Natal ragwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. Its small, yellowish flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Natal ragwort is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
