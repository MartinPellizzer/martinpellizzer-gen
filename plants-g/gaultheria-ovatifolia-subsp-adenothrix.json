    "intro": "Gaultheria ovatifolia subsp. adenothrix, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wintergreen, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, evergreen leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. The subspecies is noted for its aromatic leaves, which contain methyl salicylate, giving it a distinctive wintergreen scent."
