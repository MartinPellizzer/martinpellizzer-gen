    "intro": "Glycine cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, with the central leaflet resembling a heart shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. Glycine cordifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm climate with ample sunlight. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil and supports sustainable agriculture."
