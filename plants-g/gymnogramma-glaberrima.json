    "intro": "Gymnogramma glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that are typically glabrous, or smooth, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore sacs on the underside of its fronds, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Gymnogramma glaberrima is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively uncommon member of the fern family."
