    "intro": "Geranium depilatum, commonly known as the woolly geranium, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped or rounded, and the plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Geranium depilatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
