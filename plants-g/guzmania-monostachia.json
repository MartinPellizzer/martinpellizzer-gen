It is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that resembles a flame, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a rosette-shaped leaf structure that collects water, which serves as a microhabitat for small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are usually broad and waxy, with a vibrant green color that contrasts with the bright flowers. Guzmania monostachia is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
