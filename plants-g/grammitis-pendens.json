    "intro": "Grammitis pendens, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often hang from tree branches in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a rhizome that is creeping and produces small, clustered leaves. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Grammitis pendens thrives in humid environments and is often found in shaded, moist forest areas."
