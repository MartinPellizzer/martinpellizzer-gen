    "intro": "Gumifera nilotica, commonly known as the African gum tree, is a deciduous tree native to the savannas of sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elongated, narrow leaves that are often shed during the dry season. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It is known for exuding a sticky resin, which has been traditionally used for various medicinal and industrial purposes. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
