    "intro": "Glycine frutescens var. magnifica, commonly known as the giant sensitive plant, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of South America. It features compound leaves that are sensitive to touch, folding shut when disturbed, a characteristic shared with other members of the Mimosa genus. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers followed by flat, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its rapid growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a shade plant or in hanging baskets."
