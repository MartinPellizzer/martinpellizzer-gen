    "intro": "Gesneria triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered gesneria, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often variegated with white or silver markings. The plant produces clusters of vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Gesneria triflora is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
