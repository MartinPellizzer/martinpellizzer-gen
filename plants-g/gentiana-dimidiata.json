    "intro": "Gentiana dimidiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Gentiana dimidiata is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas, where it forms dense colonies. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
