    "intro": "Gastrolobium floribundum, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers that appear in dense clusters, typically from late winter to early spring. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine, hairy structures. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Gastrolobium floribundum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
