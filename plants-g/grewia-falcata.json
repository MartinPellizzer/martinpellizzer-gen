    "intro": "Grewia falcata, commonly known as the spearleaf gumwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy underneath. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by round, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. Grewia falcata is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and sandy soils. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
