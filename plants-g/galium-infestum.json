    "intro": "Galium infestum, commonly known as silverweed or creeping silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often covered with fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Galium infestum thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
