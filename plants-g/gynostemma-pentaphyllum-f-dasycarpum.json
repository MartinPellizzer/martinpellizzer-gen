    "intro": "Gynostemma pentaphyllum f. dasycarpum, commonly known as the hairy-fruited gynostemma, is a variant of the gynostemma plant, which is native to East Asia. This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fruits that set it apart from the typical form. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, sharing some morphological traits with other members of the gourd family. The plant typically features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers. While less commonly cultivated than the standard gynostemma, it is valued for its potential medicinal properties and adaptability to various growing conditions."
