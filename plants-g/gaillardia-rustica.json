    "intro": "Gaillardia rustica, commonly known as the Indian blanket flower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its vibrant, daisy-like flowers that range in color from red to orange and yellow. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces showy, composite flower heads that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Gaillardia rustica is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sunlight, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native gardens."
