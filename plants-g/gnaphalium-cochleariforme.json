    "intro": "Gnaphalium cochleariforme, commonly known as the kidney-shaped everlasting, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine, soft hairs. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
