    "intro": "Glochidion huahineense, commonly known as the Huahine gloryberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fruits that are capsule-like and contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
