It is characterized by its swollen, colorful stems that resemble a cup or a ball, often displaying vibrant red, orange, or yellow hues. The plant lacks true leaves, relying instead on its thick, fleshy stems for photosynthesis. Its flowers are typically small, yellow or green, and appear at the base of the stem. Gymnocactus ourselianum is a popular ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
