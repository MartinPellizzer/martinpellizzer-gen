    "intro": "Gilia exilis, commonly known as the slender gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the stems are often branched and covered with fine hairs. Gilia exilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
