    "intro": "Galatella canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant features silvery-white hairs on its leaves, which give it its common name and help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow and arranged in a single head, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Galatella canescens is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
