    "intro": "Gnaphalium yuccifolium, commonly known as the yucca leaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single blooms. The plant features narrow, sword-shaped leaves similar to those of yucca species, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are arranged in dense clusters. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. The plant's name reflects both its leaf structure and its ability to retain its color and form for extended periods after flowering."
