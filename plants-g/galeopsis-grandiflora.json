    "intro": "Galeopsis grandiflora, commonly known as greater hedge nettle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm and thrives in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by its stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact. Galeopsis grandiflora is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
