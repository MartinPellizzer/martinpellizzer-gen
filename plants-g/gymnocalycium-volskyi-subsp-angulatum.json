    "intro": "Gymnocalycium volskyi subsp. angulatum, commonly known as the angular moon cactus, is a succulent cactus native to northern Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and compact growth make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
