    "intro": "Grammitis alternidens, commonly known as the veined maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant features a distinctive pattern of alternating light and dark green veins on its leaves, which give it its common name. Grammitis alternidens thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them."
