    "intro": "Glomera pseudomonanthos, commonly known as the Cape orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to South Africa. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in coastal regions with a Mediterranean climate. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
