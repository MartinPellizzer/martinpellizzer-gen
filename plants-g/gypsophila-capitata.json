    "intro": "Gypsophila capitata, commonly known as the baby's breath or desert candytuft, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. Gypsophila capitata is often used in floral arrangements due to its delicate appearance and ability to hold its shape when dried."
