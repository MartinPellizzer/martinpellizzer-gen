    "intro": "Gentiana kurroo var. brevidens, commonly known as the Kashmiri gentian, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine meadows, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stem is erect and bears the showy flowers. This variant is noted for its smaller flower size compared to other gentian species, making it a unique and visually appealing member of the Gentianaceae family."
