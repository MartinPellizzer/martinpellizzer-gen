    "intro": "Gordonia lobbii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and dense, aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now listed as an endangered species."
