    "intro": "Gymnocalycium glaucum, commonly known as the white moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Gymnocalycium glaucum is a slow-growing, cold-hardy cactus that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for succulent collections."
