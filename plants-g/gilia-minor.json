It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Gilia minor is often found in arid regions and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient environments."
