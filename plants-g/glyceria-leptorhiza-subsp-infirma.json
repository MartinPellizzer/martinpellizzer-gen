    "intro": "Glyceria leptorhiza subsp. infirma, commonly known as slender watergrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond margins, and along stream edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Its rhizomes are slender and extensively branched, contributing to its ability to spread and form dense vegetation. This subspecies is adapted to fluctuating water levels and plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
