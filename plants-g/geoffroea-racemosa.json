    "intro": "Geoffroea racemosa, commonly known as the Chilean rose or white bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, and it has a woody stem with a distinctive, aromatic scent. Geoffroea racemosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual and olfactory characteristics."
