    "intro": "Graphorkis callichroma, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that range from red to orange, often with contrasting dark veins. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. The flowers bloom in clusters, producing a visually stunning display that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
