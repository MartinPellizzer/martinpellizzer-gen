    "intro": "Goodyera rubicunda, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories. The plant features delicate, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with distinctive red veins. Goodyera rubicunda is epiphytic in some regions, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique floral structure and vibrant coloration make it a visually striking and ecologically significant species in its habitat."
