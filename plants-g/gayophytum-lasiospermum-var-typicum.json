    "intro": "Gayophytum lasiospermum var. typicum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
