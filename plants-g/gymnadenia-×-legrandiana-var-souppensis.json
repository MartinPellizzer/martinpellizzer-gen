    "intro": "Gymnadenia \u00d7 legrandiana var. souppensis, commonly known as the Souppes hybrid orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Pyrenees region of France. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant produces dense clusters of pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny meadows and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
