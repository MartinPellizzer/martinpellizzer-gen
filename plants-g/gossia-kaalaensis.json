    "intro": "Gossia kaalaensis, commonly known as the Kaala gum tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped, glossy green leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
