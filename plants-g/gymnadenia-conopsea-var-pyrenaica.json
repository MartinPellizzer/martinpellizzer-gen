    "intro": "Gymnadenia conopsea var. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean coralroot, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces a rosette of fleshy, greenish-yellow leaves and bears small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in a spike. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and heathlands. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
