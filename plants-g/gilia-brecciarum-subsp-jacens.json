    "intro": "Gilia brecciarum subsp. jacens, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in sandy or rocky soils along dry streambeds and in desert scrub habitats."
