    "intro": "Gaultheria sclerophylla var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy wintergreen, is a variant of the wintergreen plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, dark green foliage with a fine, hairy texture on the underside of the leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, spicy flavor, often used in culinary applications. The species is adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments."
