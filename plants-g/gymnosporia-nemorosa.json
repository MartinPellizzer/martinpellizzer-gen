    "intro": "Gymnosporia nemorosa, commonly known as the forest thorn, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces woody, cone-like structures called gynosporia, which contain the seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in woodland and shrubland habitats. Gymnosporia nemorosa is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing shelter and food for various wildlife."
