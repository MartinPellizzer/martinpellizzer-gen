    "intro": "Grammitis leonardii, commonly known as the Leonard's spore moss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, rounded clusters on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis leonardii is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light."
