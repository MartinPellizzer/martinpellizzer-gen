    "intro": "Galium confertum var. laceanum, commonly known as the laceleaf woodryard, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a finely toothed or lobed margin, giving the plant its lace-like appearance. It produces clusters of tiny, white to pale green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender pedicels. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental species within the Rubiaceae family."
