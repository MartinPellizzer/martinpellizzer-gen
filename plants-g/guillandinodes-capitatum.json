    "intro": "Guillandinodes capitatum, commonly known as the golden crown fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its striking, golden-yellow fronds that contrast beautifully with its dark green base. The plant features small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Guillandinodes capitatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
