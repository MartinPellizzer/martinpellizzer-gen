    "intro": "Guarea excelsa, commonly known as the \"giant beauty\" or \"balsa tree,\" is a large tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicle inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. Guarea excelsa is valued for its lightweight, strong wood and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
