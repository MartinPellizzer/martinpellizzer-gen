    "intro": "Galium flaccidum, commonly known as the flaccid bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Galium flaccidum is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
