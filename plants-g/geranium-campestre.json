    "intro": "Geranium campestre, commonly known as the field geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of five-petaled flowers, typically in shades of pink, red, or white. The leaves are palmately lobed, with a serrated edge, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in meadows and grassy areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and wildflower landscapes."
