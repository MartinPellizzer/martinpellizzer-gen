    "intro": "Geranium miahuatlanum, commonly known as the Miahuatlan geranium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically produces vibrant red or pink blooms during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Geranium miahuatlanum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
