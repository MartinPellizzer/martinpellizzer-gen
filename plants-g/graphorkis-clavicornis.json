    "intro": "Graphorkis clavicornis, commonly known as the knobbed rock fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, knob-like spore-producing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a single row along the fertile fronds. The plant typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, preferring humid and shaded environments. Its fronds are usually short and compact, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. The species is notable for its specialized adaptations to nutrient-poor substrates, making it a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
