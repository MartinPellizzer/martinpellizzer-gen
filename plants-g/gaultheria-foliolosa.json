    "intro": "Gaultheria foliolosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by bright red berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. Gaultheria foliolosa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
