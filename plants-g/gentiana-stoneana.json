    "intro": "Gentiana stoneana, commonly known as the Sierra Stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to arid and rocky environments. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
