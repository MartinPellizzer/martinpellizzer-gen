It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces yellow-orange berries that contain a high concentration of hydroxycitric acid, which is of interest in herbal medicine. Its bark and leaves are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Garcinia cambogioides thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
