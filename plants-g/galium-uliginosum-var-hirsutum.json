    "intro": "Galium uliginosum var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This species plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
