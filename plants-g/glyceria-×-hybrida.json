    "intro": "Glyceria \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid greenbulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic wildlife. Glyceria \u00d7 hybrida is also used in wetland restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ecological benefits."
