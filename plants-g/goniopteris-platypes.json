    "intro": "Goniopteris platypes, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often floating on the water surface. The fronds are usually divided into segments with a distinctive, serrated edge. This plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
