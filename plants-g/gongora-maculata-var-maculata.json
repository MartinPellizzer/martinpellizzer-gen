    "intro": "Gongora maculata var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted gongora, is a striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It is characterized by its vibrant, velvety petals and a unique, intricate pattern of spots and stripes on its flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers, which can be up to 10 centimeters in diameter, are highly fragrant and attract various pollinators. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
