    "intro": "Greggia montana, commonly known as the mountain greggia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Greggia montana thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it is primarily found in the wild."
