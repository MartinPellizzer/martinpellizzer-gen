    "intro": "Glycine hispida var. rara, commonly known as the rare hairy bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features compound leaves with small, hairy stipules and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated pods. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other Glycine species due to its rarity and specific growing conditions."
