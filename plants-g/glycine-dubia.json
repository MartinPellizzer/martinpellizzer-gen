    "intro": "Glycine dubia, commonly known as the desert bean or wild soybean, is a leguminous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces elongated pods containing small, edible seeds that are rich in protein and oil. Glycine dubia has adapted to harsh environments through deep root systems and the ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable species for ecological restoration. Its botanical features make it both a useful forage plant and a subject of study in plant physiology and ecology."
