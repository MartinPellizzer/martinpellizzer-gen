    "intro": "Gonolobus rotatus, commonly known as the spiral vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its helically twisted stems that allow it to climb and wrap around supports. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a rough texture. Gonolobus rotatus is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its unique growth habit."
