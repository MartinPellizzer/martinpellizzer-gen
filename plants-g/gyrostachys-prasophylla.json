    "intro": "Gyrostachys prasophylla, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a distinctive globular shape, featuring a short, thick stem and a dense cluster of leaves at the base. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Gyrostachys prasophylla is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in sandy or rocky soils."
