    "intro": "Galium anfractum, commonly known as the zigzag bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Galium anfractum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
