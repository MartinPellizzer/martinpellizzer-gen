    "intro": "Gleichenia moniliformis, commonly known as the chain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that are often divided into linear segments resembling a chain, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are usually located on the underside of its leaves. Gleichenia moniliformis is an epiphytic or lithophytic plant, meaning it can grow on other plants or rocks without being parasitic."
