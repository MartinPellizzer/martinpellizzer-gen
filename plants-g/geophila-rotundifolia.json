    "intro": "Geophila rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf mountain beauty, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has rounded, opposite leaves that are often hairy, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Geophila rotundifolia is often found in alpine meadows and forest understories, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native range."
