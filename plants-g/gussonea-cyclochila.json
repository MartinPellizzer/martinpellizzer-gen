    "intro": "Gussonea cyclochila, commonly known as the cyclochila lichen, is a unique species of lichen that exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, which adheres tightly to rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a smooth and leathery texture. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found on limestone or sandstone substrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized lichen species."
