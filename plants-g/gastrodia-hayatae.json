    "intro": "Gastrodia hayatae, commonly known as the Japanese thunder god mushroom, is a rare and unique orchid-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it derives its nutrients from fungi rather than through photosynthesis. The plant lacks chlorophyll and has a fleshy, tuberous structure that stores energy. It blooms with small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance. Due to its limited habitat and endangered status, it is of significant interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
