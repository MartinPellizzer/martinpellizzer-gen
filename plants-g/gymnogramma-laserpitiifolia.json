    "intro": "Gymnogramma laserpitiifolia, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are covered in a dense layer of fine, golden hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, ovate pinnae that are often arranged in a dense, shield-like structure. Gymnogramma laserpitiifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
