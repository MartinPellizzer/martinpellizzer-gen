    "intro": "Gomphocarpus tomentosus subsp. tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels. It is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and savannas. The milky sap it exudes is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
