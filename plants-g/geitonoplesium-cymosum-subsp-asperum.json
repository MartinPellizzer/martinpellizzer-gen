    "intro": "Geitonoplesium cymosum subsp. asperum, commonly known as the rough cymosum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Marcgraviaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its woody vines and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers that are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a rough texture, giving the subspecies its common name. The fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains multiple seeds, contributing to its ecological role in seed dispersal."
