    "intro": "Glandularia ribifolia, commonly known as the redstem flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its glandular leaves, which secrete a sticky substance, and its showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its small, elongated seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. Glandularia ribifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
