    "intro": "Grantia globosa, commonly known as the globe sponge or globular sponge, is a unique marine organism that belongs to the phylum Porifera. It is characterized by its spherical shape and a dense, porous structure that allows it to filter water for nutrients. The sponge's body is composed of a matrix of collagen fibers and a network of channels called spongiocytes. It lacks true tissues and organs, relying instead on specialized cells for various functions. Grantia globosa is typically found in shallow coastal waters and is an important part of marine ecosystems."
