    "intro": "Galphimia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf galphimia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom throughout the warmer months. Its leaves are small, elliptical, and sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. Galphimia sessilifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in sunny, well-drained conditions."
