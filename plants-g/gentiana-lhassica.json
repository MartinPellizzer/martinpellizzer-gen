    "intro": "Gentiana lhassica, commonly known as the Tibetan gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas, particularly in Tibet and Nepal. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
