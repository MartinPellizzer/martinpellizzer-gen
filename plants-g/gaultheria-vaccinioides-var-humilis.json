    "intro": "Gaultheria vaccinioides var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf wax myrtle, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, dark green leaves that are glossy and emit a subtle aromatic scent when crushed. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to provide habitat and food for wildlife."
