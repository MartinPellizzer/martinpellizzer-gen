    "intro": "Gonianthes sagrana, commonly known as the sacred nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces striking purple or violet flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are ovate and have a velvety texture, while the fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to red as it matures. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided for cultivation and is more commonly found in wild habitats."
