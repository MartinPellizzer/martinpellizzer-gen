It is characterized by its distinctive grayish-blue foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant belongs to the Myrtaceae family, sharing some structural features with other members of this family. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
