    "intro": "Gaultheria rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the mountain cranberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are lance-shaped and arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and wildlife. Its compact form and dense foliage make it well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover in shaded, moist environments. Gaultheria rosmarinifolia is also valued for its aromatic leaves and historical use in traditional medicine."
