    "intro": "Gymnocalycium riojense subsp. paucispinum, commonly known as the Rioja prickly pear, is a cacti species native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in sparse, pale spines. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its foliage consists of flat, paddle-shaped stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
