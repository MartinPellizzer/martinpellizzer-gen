    "intro": "Gordonia cristalensis, commonly known as the Crystal Mountain gordonia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gordonia cristalensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
