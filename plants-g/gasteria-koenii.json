    "intro": "Gasteria koenii, commonly known as the Koenig's gasteria, is a species of flowering plant in the asparagus family. It is native to South Africa, specifically the eastern region, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves with white or pale markings. It produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers on a tall, leafless stem during the spring season. Gasteria koenii is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
