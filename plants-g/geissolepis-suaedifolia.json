    "intro": "Geissolepis suaedifolia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, adapting to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Geissolepis suaedifolia is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
