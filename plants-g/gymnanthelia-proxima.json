It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its leaves are usually narrow and leathery. Gymnanthelia proxima plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
