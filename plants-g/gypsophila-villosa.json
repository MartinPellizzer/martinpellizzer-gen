    "intro": "Gypsophila villosa, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers during the summer months. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Gypsophila villosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
