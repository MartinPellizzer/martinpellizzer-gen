    "intro": "Gentiana nivalis subf. reducta, commonly known as the Alpine gentian, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps and other mountainous areas. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its subsp. reducta form is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth and reduced corolla lobes compared to the typical form. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its adaptation to extreme alpine conditions."
