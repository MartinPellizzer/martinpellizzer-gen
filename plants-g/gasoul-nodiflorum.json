    "intro": "Gasoul nodiflorum, commonly known as the mountain snowflower, is a rare alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has dark green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its cold, arid environment. It is adapted to survive in low temperatures and strong winds, often growing at altitudes above 4,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
