    "intro": "Gentiana herzogii, commonly known as Herzog's gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps and surrounding regions. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gentiana herzogii is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
