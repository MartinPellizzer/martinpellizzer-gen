    "intro": "Glochidion temehaniense, commonly known as the Temehani lanceleaf, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Glochidion temehaniense is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
