    "intro": "Gymnogramma pinnata var. polypodioides, commonly known as the Polypodioides Shield Fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its pinnate fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and the fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in rows along the veins."
