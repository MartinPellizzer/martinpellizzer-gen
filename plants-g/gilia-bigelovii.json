    "intro": "Gilia bigelovii, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. It produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, aiding in its adaptation to harsh, dry conditions."
