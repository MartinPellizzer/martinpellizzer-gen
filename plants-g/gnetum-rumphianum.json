    "intro": "Gnetum rumphianum, commonly known as the tropical cycad, is a member of the Gnetophyta division and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones rather than flowers. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and conservation efforts."
