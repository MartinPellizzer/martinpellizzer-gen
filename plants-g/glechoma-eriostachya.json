    "intro": "Glechoma eriostachya, commonly known as the creeping ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats on the ground. Glechoma eriostachya is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks."
