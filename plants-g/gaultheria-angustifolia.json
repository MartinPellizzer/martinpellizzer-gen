    "intro": "Gaultheria angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf wintergreen, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the forests of eastern North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are rich in methyl salicylate, a compound responsible for the plant's distinctive wintergreen scent. Gaultheria angustifolia thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
