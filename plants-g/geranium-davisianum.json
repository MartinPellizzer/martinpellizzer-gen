    "intro": "Geranium davisianum, commonly known as the Davis's geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple tinge. The plant produces clusters of showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom from late spring to early fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
