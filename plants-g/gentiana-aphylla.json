    "intro": "Gentiana aphylla, commonly known as the leafless gentian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures that help it conserve water in its harsh alpine habitat. Its flowers are typically tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gentiana aphylla is often found in rocky soils and is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
