    "intro": "Grewia crenata, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually opposite and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. Grewia crenata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
