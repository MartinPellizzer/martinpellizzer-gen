    "intro": "Glechoma sinograndis, commonly known as Chinese ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported medicinal properties."
