    "intro": "Glossocardia setosa, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that attract various pollinators. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic to some animals. Glossocardia setosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-arid conditions."
