    "intro": "Glycine lantzii, commonly known as the Lantz's soybean, is a leguminous plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pod-like fruits containing several seeds, which are used for both culinary and industrial purposes. Glycine lantzii is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility in its native habitat."
