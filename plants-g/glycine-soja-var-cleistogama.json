    "intro": "Glycine soja var. cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous soybean, is a variant of the soybean plant characterized by its closed, self-fertilizing flowers. This botanical feature allows for efficient reproduction without the need for pollinators, which is an adaptation to ensure seed production in less favorable environmental conditions. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is native to East Asia, particularly China. Its leaves are trifoliate, and the pods contain small, yellowish seeds that are used in traditional agriculture. Due to its unique reproductive strategy, it is of interest in plant breeding and ecological studies."
