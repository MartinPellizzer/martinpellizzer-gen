It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial that typically forms dense mats on moist, often boggy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish to white flower heads that are often surrounded by pale green or white bracts. Its leaves are usually narrow, linear, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.
