It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its intricate, net-like pattern on the leaves, which gives it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in woodland or open meadow habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
