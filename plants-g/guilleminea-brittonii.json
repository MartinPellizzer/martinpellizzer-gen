    "intro": "Guilleminea brittonii, commonly known as the Britton's guilleminea, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has finely divided, aromatic leaves. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
