    "intro": "Gueldenstaedtia giraldii, commonly known as the Giraldii vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in temperate regions of Europe. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. Its pods contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize open areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
