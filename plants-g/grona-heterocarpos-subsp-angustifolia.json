    "intro": "Grona heterocarpos subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf grona, is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and distinctive floral structures. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with a unique arrangement of sepals and petals, often surrounded by bracts. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the stems are often reddish in color. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
