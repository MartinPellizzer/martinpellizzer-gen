    "intro": "Grevillea papuana, commonly known as the Papuan grevillea, is a striking flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Papua, Indonesia. It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences and attract native birds and insects. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid habitat. Grevillea papuana is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological systems of its native environment."
