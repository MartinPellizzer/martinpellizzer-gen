    "intro": "Gossypium guyanense var. braziliense, commonly known as the Brazilian cotton plant, is a wild species native to South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy stems, which are typical features of the genus Gossypium. The plant produces small, fluffy cotton-like fibers that are used in traditional textiles by indigenous communities. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at improving cotton resilience and yield."
