    "intro": "Gagea triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf gagea, is a small, perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in early spring. Its bulbs are small and clustered, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded woodlands. Gagea triphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable climates."
