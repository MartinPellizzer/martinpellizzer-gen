    "intro": "Galeopsis angustifolia subsp. carpetana, commonly known as carpetweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, with a distinct serrated edge. Small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in whorls along the stems, and they bloom from late spring to early autumn. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields."
