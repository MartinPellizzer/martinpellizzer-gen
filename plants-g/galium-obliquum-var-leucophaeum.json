It features slender, ascending stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and have a distinctive white or pale green underside, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. This variety is closely related to other species in the Rubiaceae family and is often found in moist, shaded woodlands."
