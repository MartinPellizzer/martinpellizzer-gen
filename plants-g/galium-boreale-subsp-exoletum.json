    "intro": "Galium boreale subsp. exoletum, commonly known as the Arctic bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically forms dense mats close to the ground, with slender, wiry stems that often lie flat on the soil surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered with fine, soft hairs. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons."
