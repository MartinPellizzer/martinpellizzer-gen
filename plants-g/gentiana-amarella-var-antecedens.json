    "intro": "Gentiana amarella var. antecedens, commonly known as the early gentian, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom early in the spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stem is erect and often branched. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
