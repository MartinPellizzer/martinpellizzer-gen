    "intro": "Gomphandra agusanensis, commonly known as the Agusan gomphandra, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and simple, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is typically found in lowland to montane forest habitats, often in areas with high humidity and moderate rainfall. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique botanical species from habitat loss and over-collection."
