    "intro": "Galium babadaghense, commonly known as the Babadagh bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, sprawling stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky and dry habitats, often found in alpine meadows and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
