    "intro": "Gagea composita, commonly known as the composite gagea, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, rounded bulbs that serve as storage organs for nutrients. It typically blooms in early spring and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. Gagea composita is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cooler, moist environments."
