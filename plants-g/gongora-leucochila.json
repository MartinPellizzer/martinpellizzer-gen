    "intro": "Gongora leucochila, commonly known as the White-lipped Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking white petals and a distinctive, elongated lip that is often tinged with purple or pink. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are highly fragrant and bloom during the cooler months, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
