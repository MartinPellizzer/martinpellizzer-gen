    "intro": "Gymnolomia rudbeckioides, commonly known as the roughleaf gum tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal and heathland environments. The plant is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy upper surface. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Gymnolomia rudbeckioides is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in local ecosystems."
