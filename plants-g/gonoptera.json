    "intro": "Gonoptera, commonly known as the goldenrod gall fly, is a small insect that induces the formation of galls on goldenrod plants. The galls, which are abnormal growths on the plant, provide shelter and nutrients for the developing larvae. These galls are typically found on the stems and leaves of goldenrod species. The botanical impact of Gonoptera involves the alteration of plant morphology and the potential reduction of plant vigor. While the galls are not harmful to the plant's survival, they can affect its aesthetic and ecological roles."
