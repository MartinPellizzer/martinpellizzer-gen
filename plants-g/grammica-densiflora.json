It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are upright and can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. Grammica densiflora is often found in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks."
