    "intro": "Gomphrena desertorum var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert bluemink, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its production of small, often blue or purple, bract-like flowers that resemble tiny minks. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry environments."
