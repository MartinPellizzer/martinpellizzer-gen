    "intro": "Grewia schliebenii, commonly known as the silverleaf gumtree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its pale grey or silver-green leaves, which are covered in fine, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Grewia schliebenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
