    "intro": "Gnidia villosa, commonly known as the hairy gnidia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a distinctive glandular appearance. Its leaves are typically ovate or elliptical, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Gnidia villosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
