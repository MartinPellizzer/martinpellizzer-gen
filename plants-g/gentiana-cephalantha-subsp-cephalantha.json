It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and mountain meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
