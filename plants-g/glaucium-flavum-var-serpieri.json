    "intro": "Glaucium flavum var. serpieri, commonly known as the yellow flax or yellow hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow, rayed flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is part of the Papaveraceae family, which includes poppies and other flowering plants with showy blooms."
