    "intro": "Grammitis mariae, commonly known as the Marie's fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi-lobed or trifoliate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Grammitis mariae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
