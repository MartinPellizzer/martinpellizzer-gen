It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are broad and flat, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers on tall, branched stems during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it an ideal choice for xeriscaping. Its compact size and unique foliage make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and indoor settings."
