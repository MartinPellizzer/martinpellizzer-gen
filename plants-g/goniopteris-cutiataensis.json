    "intro": "Goniopteris cutiataensis, commonly known as the Tertiary fern, is a fossil plant that lived during the Paleocene epoch. It is characterized by its large, complex fronds with a distinctive structure resembling modern ferns. The plant's leaves were likely broad and segmented, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in its ancient environment. Its reproductive structures suggest it reproduced via spores, a common method among early land plants. Fossilized remains of Goniopteris cutiataensis provide valuable insights into the flora of ancient ecosystems."
