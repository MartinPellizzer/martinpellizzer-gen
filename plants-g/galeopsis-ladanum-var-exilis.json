    "intro": "Galeopsis ladanum var. exilis, commonly known as slender hedge-nettle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides or in meadows. The plant features small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered with fine hairs, and the stems are upright with a somewhat hairy texture. This variety is often mistaken for other similar species due to its delicate appearance and growth habit."
