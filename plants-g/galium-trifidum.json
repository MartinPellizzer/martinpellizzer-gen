    "intro": "Galium trifidum, commonly known as three-lobed bedstraw, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, opposite leaves. The leaves are typically trifid, meaning they are divided into three distinct lobes, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
