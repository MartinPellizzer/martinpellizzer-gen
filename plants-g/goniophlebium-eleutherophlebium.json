    "intro": "Goniophlebium eleutherophlebium, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks and branches in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of moss-like structures. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, clustered formations along the leaf margins. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light."
