    "intro": "Gastrodia longitubularis, commonly known as the long-tubular orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous rhizomes and lack of true leaves, relying instead on its underground structures for photosynthesis. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive, elongated labellum. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and is often found in humid, forested areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
