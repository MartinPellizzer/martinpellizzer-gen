    "intro": "Gleichenia affinis var. packensis, commonly known as the Pack's Gleichenia, is a fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green and slightly serrated along the edges. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is noted for its adaptability and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
