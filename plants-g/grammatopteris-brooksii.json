    "intro": "Grammatopteris brooksii, commonly known as the Brooks' grammatophyllum, is a fossilized plant belonging to the family Cycadaceae. It is primarily found in coal seams from the Carboniferous period, indicating its presence in ancient swampy environments. The plant exhibits a distinctive morphology with a short trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. Its leaves are often preserved as compressions, showing intricate venation patterns. This species provides important insights into the evolution of early seed plants and the paleoecology of Carboniferous forests."
