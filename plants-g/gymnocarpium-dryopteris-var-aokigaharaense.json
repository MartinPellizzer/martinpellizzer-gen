    "intro": "Gymnocarpium dryopteris var. aokigaharaense, commonly known as the Aokigahara fern, is a variant of the genus Gymnocarpium, which belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant produces small, naked sporangia on the underside of its leaves, a feature that distinguishes it from other ferns with spore-bearing structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. This variant is native to Japan and is notable for its ecological and botanical significance in the region."
