    "intro": "Gnaphalium imbricatum, commonly known as the silverleaf woollyhead, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and feathery foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense, woolly inflorescences, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are silvery-gray due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment."
