    "intro": "Galactia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical, woody pods that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Galactia stenophylla has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
