    "intro": "Gomesa ranifera, commonly known as the sticky leaf plant, is a unique species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which can trap small insects. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its botanical features include lance-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. The sticky secretion not only aids in pest control but also contributes to its ecological role in its native habitat."
