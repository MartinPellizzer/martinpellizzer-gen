    "intro": "Galium ciliatum, commonly known as silky bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with soft, hairy margins. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine for their mild diuretic properties. Galium ciliatum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
