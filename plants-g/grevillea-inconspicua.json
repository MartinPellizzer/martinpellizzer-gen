    "intro": "Grevillea inconspicua, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grevillea, is a small shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It typically grows to a height of around 1 to 2 metres and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, blooming from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Grevillea inconspicua is well adapted to the dry climate of its native region and is relatively drought tolerant."
