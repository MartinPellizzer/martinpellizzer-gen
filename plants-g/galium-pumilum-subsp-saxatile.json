    "intro": "Galium pumilum subsp. saxatile, commonly known as the saxatile bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to rocky and mountainous regions. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native range."
