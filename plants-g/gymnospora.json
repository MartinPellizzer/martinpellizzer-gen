    "intro": "Gymnospora, commonly known as the \"naked seed plant,\" is a group of seed plants that do not produce flowers or fruits. These plants are characterized by their naked seeds, which are not enclosed within an ovary. Gymnosporas typically have needle-like or scale-like leaves and are often found in temperate or cold climates. They include well-known species such as pines, firs, and spruces. The botanical study of gymnosporas is important for understanding plant evolution and ecological roles in various ecosystems."
