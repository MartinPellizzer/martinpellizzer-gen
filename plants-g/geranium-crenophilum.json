    "intro": "Geranium crenophilum, commonly known as the mountain geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It features upright, branched stems that are covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a slightly wavy or scalloped edge, giving it a distinctive appearance. Geranium crenophilum thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
