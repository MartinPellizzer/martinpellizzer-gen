    "intro": "Guatteria polycarpa subsp. drupacea, commonly known as the clustered guatteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a drupe, which develops from the flower and contains a single seed. This species is of interest to botanists due to its morphological features and ecological role in its native habitats."
