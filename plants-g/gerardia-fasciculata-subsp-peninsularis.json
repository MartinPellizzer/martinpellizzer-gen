It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal areas. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and genetic distinctiveness."
