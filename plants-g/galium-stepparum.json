    "intro": "Galium stepparum, commonly known as steppe bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in whorled clusters along the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Galium stepparum thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
