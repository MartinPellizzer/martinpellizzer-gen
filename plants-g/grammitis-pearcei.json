    "intro": "Grammitis pearcei, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in rainforests. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Grammitis pearcei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant due to its compact size and elegant appearance."
