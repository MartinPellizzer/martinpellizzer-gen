    "intro": "Gilia subnuda, commonly known as the naked gilia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, branching stems and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple. Its flowers are typically tubular with five lobes and are adapted for pollination by birds or insects. The leaves are linear to lance-shaped and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance."
