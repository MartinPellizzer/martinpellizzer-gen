    "intro": "Gnaphalium gerberifolium, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow, silvery-gray, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting flowers and attractive appearance."
