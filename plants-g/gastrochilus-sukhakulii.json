    "intro": "Gastrochilus sukhakulii, commonly known as the Sukhakul's stomach orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Thailand. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a pouch-like structure that resembles a stomach. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers are usually small, with a complex arrangement of sepals and petals, and it blooms during the rainy season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
