    "intro": "Gundelia mesopotamica, commonly known as the Mesopotamian gum plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, an adaptation to its harsh environment. The plant produces a resinous gum that has been historically used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it resilient in dry climates. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary response to the extreme conditions of its native habitat."
