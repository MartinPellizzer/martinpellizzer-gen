    "intro": "Gossypium somalense, commonly known as Somali cotton, is a wild cotton species native to the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and produces small, fluffy cotton fibers that are typically shorter than those of cultivated cotton varieties. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to harsh climatic conditions. It has been studied for its potential in breeding programs to improve drought tolerance in cotton crops. Its genetic diversity may contribute to the development of more resilient cotton varieties for future agricultural needs."
