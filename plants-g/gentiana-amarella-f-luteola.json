    "intro": "Gentiana amarella f. luteola, commonly known as the yellow gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which contrast with its dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, calcareous soils. It blooms from late summer to early autumn, producing showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
