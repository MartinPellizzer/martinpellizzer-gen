    "intro": "Gaertnera occidentalis, commonly known as the western gaertnera, is a flowering plant native to the western regions of the United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Gaertnera occidentalis is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or disturbed areas."
