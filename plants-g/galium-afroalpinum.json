    "intro": "Galium afroalpinum, commonly known as African bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats, often at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Galium afroalpinum is adapted to cool, moist environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various insects."
