    "intro": "Goniopteris alan-smithiana, commonly known as the Alan-Smith's water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its large, intricate fronds that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant thrives in damp, shaded environments, typically near streams or in wetlands. Its historical significance lies in its role as a relic of the Gondwana flora, offering insights into prehistoric plant life. Due to habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and is protected in several conservation reserves."
