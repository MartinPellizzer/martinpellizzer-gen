    "intro": "Gymnadenia corneliana, commonly known as the sweet cicely, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is known for its sweet, licorice-like scent. Gymnadenia corneliana is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
