    "intro": "Galanthus reginae-olgae subsp. reginae-olgae, commonly known as the Queen of Wales snowdrop, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It produces delicate, white, nodding flowers with a single erect tepal in the center, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulb and are adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments. It prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil and partial to full shade. This subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring display."
