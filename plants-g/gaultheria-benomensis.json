It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many plants adapted to acidic and nutrient-poor soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Its berries, which are red when mature, contain seeds and are an important food source for local wildlife. The plant is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine."
