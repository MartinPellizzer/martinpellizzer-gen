    "intro": "Glochidion superbum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or stinging leaf, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits containing one or two seeds. Glochidion superbum is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and secondary forests. Its stinging hairs can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care."
