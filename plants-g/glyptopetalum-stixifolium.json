    "intro": "Glyptopetalum stixifolium, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Glyptopetalum stixifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to rocky, well-drained soils."
