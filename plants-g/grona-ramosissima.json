    "intro": "Grona ramosissima, commonly known as the hairy willow, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. Due to its adaptability and ornamental qualities, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
