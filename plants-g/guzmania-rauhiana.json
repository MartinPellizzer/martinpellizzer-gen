    "intro": "Guzmania rauhiana, commonly known as the Rauh's flame plant, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that often displays red, orange, or yellow hues. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small aquatic environment for microorganisms and small invertebrates. Its pseudobulbs and basal rosette structure allow it to thrive in humid, shaded conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Guzmania rauhiana is known for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
