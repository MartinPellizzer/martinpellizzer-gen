It thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in marshes, tidal flats, and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny grains. It plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Its adaptability to saltwater makes it an important component of coastal wetland ecosystems."
