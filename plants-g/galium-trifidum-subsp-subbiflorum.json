    "intro": "Galium trifidum subsp. subbiflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate on the ground, forming dense mats. The leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three narrow, lance-shaped lobes. Small, white or pale yellow flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
