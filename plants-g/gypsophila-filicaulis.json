    "intro": "Gypsophila filicaulis, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, fluffy white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for dry, rocky environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration. Gypsophila filicaulis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
