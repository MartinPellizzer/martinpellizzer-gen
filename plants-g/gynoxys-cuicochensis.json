It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has palmate leaves with a hairy texture, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a valuable subject for botanical research."
