    "intro": "Geum scopulorum, commonly known as the rock avens, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor conditions, allowing it to thrive in harsh, rocky habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
