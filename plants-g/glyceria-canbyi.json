It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams and ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Glyceria canbyi is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
