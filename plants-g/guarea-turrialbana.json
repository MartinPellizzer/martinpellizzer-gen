    "intro": "Guarea turrialbana, commonly known as the yellow balsa or white cedar, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its lightweight wood, it has historical uses in construction and as a material for model building."
