    "intro": "Galium anglicum, commonly known as cleavers, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Galium anglicum is commonly found in moist habitats such as meadows, ditches, and woodland edges."
