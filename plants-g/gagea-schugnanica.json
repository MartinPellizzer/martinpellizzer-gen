    "intro": "Gagea schugnanica, commonly known as the Schugnan lily, is a rare and delicate perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive harsh seasonal conditions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Gagea schugnanica is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
