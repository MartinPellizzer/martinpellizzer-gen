    "intro": "Guzmania ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian flaming sword, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It features a vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that resembles a sword, typically in shades of red or orange. The plant possesses a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small aquatic environment for microorganisms. Its flowers are short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Guzmania ecuadorensis thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
