    "intro": "Grammitis mayoris, commonly known as the giant fern, is a striking member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant exhibits a distinctive dichotomous branching pattern, with each frond splitting into two equal parts. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters along the margins of the fronds. Grammitis mayoris thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions."
