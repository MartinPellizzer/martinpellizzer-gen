    "intro": "Glandularia clavata, commonly known as the glandular blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture and help in water conservation. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides. Glandularia clavata is a perennial species that plays a role in supporting local pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
