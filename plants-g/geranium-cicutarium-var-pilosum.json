    "intro": "Geranium cicutarium var. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy cranesbill, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided with serrated edges, and the roots are fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
