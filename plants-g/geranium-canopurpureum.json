It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage color and compact growth habit."
