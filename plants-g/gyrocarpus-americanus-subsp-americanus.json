    "intro": "Gyrocarpus americanus subsp. americanus, commonly known as the American whirlgen, is a small, deciduous tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and distinctive, spiny fruits. The plant is adapted to coastal and brackish environments, often growing in mangrove swamps and tidal flats. Its fruits, which are indehiscent and resemble small whirlwinds, contain a single seed and are dispersed by water. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its unique morphology and role in coastal ecosystems."
