    "intro": "Grammitis sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a sinuous, undulating edge, which gives it its common name. Grammitis sinuata plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to the microhabitat diversity and supporting various invertebrate life."
