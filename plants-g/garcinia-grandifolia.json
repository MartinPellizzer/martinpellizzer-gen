    "intro": "Garcinia grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf garcinia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, which develop into fleshy, orange-red berries. These berries contain a single seed and are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Garcinia grandifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has also been studied for its potential pharmacological properties."
