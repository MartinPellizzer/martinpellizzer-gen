    "intro": "Gagea altaica, commonly known as the Altai scilla, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Its bulbous underground stem stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh alpine conditions. Gagea altaica is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
