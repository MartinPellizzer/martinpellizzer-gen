It features slender, branched stems that often lie prostrate or ascending, and its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are borne on slender pedicels and are often accompanied by small, leaf-like bracts. Galium alboflorum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides."
