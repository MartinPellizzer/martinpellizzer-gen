    "intro": "Gallitrichum verbenacum, commonly known as the common gallworts, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Geraniaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a distinctive, somewhat succulent texture. Gallitrichum verbenacum is known for its ability to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion in its native habitats."
