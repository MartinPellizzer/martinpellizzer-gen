    "intro": "Galium \u00d7 hillardiae, commonly known as the silverweed. It is a hybrid species within the Rubiaceae family, characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems and leaves have a distinctive silvery sheen, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Galium \u00d7 hillardiae is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
