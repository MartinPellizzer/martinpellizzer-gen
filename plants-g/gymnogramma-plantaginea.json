It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, mat-like growth form. The plant features rhizomes that spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize moist, shaded areas effectively. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles tiny buttons. Gymnogramma plantaginea is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, well-drained soils."
