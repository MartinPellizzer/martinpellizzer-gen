It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that aid in its propagation. The botanical features of this species make it a notable example of xerophytic adaptation in the region."
