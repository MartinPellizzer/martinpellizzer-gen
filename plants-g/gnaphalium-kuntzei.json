    "intro": "Gnaphalium kuntzei, commonly known as the silverleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas, often forming dense mats. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance and aiding in water conservation. The flowers are usually pale yellow to white, and the plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds."
