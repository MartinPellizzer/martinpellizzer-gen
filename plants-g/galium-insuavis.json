    "intro": "Galium insuavis, commonly known as sour woodruff, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and stems emit a distinctive, somewhat sour scent, which is more pronounced when crushed. Galium insuavis thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks."
