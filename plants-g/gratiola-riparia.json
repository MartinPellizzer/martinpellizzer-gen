    "intro": "Gratiola riparia, commonly known as the riparian gratiola, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows along the edges of streams, rivers, and other moist environments, where it thrives in sandy or loamy soils. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in loose inflorescences, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Gratiola riparia is known for its adaptability to fluctuating water levels and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in riparian zones."
