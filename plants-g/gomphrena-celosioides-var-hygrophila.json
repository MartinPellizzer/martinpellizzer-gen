    "intro": "Gomphrena celosioides var. hygrophila, commonly known as the swamp bluemink, is a perennial herb native to wetland areas of the southeastern United States. It features dense, spike-like inflorescences that range in color from blue to purple, giving it a striking appearance. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its unique floral structure and habitat preference make it an interesting subject for botanical study and ecological restoration projects."
