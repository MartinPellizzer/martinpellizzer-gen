It is characterized by its drooping, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through underground stems. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unique growth form."
