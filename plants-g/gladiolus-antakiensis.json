    "intro": "Gladiolus antakiensis, commonly known as the Antakian gladiolus, is a rare and endemic species native to the highlands of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that typically display a range of vibrant colors, including red, pink, and white. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and grows from a rhizomatous underground stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
