    "intro": "Grewia beguinotii, commonly known as the red gum tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but not generally consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Grewia beguinotii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for local wildlife."
