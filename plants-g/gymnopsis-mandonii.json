    "intro": "Gymnopsis mandonii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and a distinctive corona. Gymnopsis mandonii is adapted to harsh, dry environments, featuring thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. It serves as a host plant for certain butterfly species and has medicinal uses in traditional Native American practices."
