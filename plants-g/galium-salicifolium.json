    "intro": "Galium salicifolium, commonly known as willow-leaf bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender stems that are often prostrate or ascending, covered in fine hairs. The leaves are lanceolate to ovate, with a distinct willow-like appearance, and are usually hairy on both surfaces. Small white or pinkish flowers appear in clusters, and the plant produces small, three-lobed berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
