    "intro": "Geophila reniformis var. americana, commonly known as American kidneyroot, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense groundcover in suitable habitats."
