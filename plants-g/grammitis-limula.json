    "intro": "Grammitis limula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both roots and new growth, allowing it to spread along forest floors or rocky areas. Its leaves are usually lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Grammitis limula thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions of the Americas."
