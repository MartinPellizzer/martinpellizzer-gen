It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its small, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
