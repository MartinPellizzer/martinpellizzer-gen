    "intro": "Guilandina wrightiana, commonly known as the giant guilandina, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and long, twisted vines that can reach lengths of up to 30 meters. The plant produces showy, cream-colored flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and hardiness, it is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture."
