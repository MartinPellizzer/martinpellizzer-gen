    "intro": "Grevillea arenaria subsp. arenaria, commonly known as the sand grevillea, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to sandy soils and low rainfall, making it drought-tolerant. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, and it is a popular choice for coastal gardens due to its hardiness. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for native wildlife."
