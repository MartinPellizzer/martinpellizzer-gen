It is characterized by its simple, often lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. Gymnoleima species are usually found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
