It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically arrowhead-shaped, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist soil and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Gynerium sagittatum is also known for its ability to help stabilize soil and improve water quality in wetland ecosystems."
