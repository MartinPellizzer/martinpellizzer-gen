    "intro": "Gymnadenia nigra f. vesubiana, commonly known as the dark pink orchid, is a rare and striking variant of the common grass pinks. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its deep pink to almost black flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in moist, calcareous grasslands and heathlands. It has lance-shaped leaves and a compact growth habit, with a single spike of flowers. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
