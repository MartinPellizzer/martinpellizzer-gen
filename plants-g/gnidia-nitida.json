    "intro": "Gnidia nitida, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble those of the ghost orchid, hence its common name. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often covered in a fine, silky hair that gives it a unique appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Gnidia nitida is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
