    "intro": "Gomphocarpus cornutus, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy as well. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap contains latex, which is a common feature in the milkweed family. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal."
