    "intro": "Goniopteris quadrangularis, commonly known as the quadrangular fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, quadrangular (four-sided) stems and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a tall, unbranched trunk that is covered with a thick, fibrous layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with each segment bearing a row of small, round sori on the underside. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
