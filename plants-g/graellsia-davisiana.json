    "intro": "Graellsia davisiana, commonly known as the Davis's orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal environments. Its flowers are usually borne on terminal inflorescences, and the plant prefers well-drained soil and bright, indirect light. Graellsia davisiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates."
