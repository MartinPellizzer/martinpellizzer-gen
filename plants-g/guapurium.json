    "intro": "Guapurium, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Guapurium stipulatum, which is native to South America. These plants are characterized by their ornamental value, featuring attractive leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The wood of some species is highly valued for its density and rich color, making it sought after in musical instrument crafting. However, due to overharvesting, many species are now threatened with extinction."
