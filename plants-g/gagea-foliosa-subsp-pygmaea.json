    "intro": "Gagea foliosa subsp. pygmaea, commonly known as the pygmy gagea, is a small, bulbous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open, sunny habitats. The plant produces delicate, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale green flowers in early spring. It is part of the Amaryllidaceae family, which includes other bulbous plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
