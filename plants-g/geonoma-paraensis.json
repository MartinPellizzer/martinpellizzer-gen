    "intro": "Geonoma paraensis, commonly known as the Paraense geonoma, is a species of fern found in the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Geonoma paraensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to the forest's biodiversity and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
