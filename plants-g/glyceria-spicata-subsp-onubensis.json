    "intro": "Glyceria spicata subsp. onubensis, commonly known as the Onubian spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and riverbanks. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to temperate climates with adequate water availability. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
