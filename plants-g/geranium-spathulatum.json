    "intro": "Geranium spathulatum, commonly known as the broadleaf geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
