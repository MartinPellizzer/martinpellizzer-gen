    "intro": "Gwilymia moricolor, commonly known as the rainbow orchid, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, multicolored petals that range from violet to yellow, creating a visually stunning display. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy texture, which helps retain moisture in its natural habitat. Gwilymia moricolor is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
