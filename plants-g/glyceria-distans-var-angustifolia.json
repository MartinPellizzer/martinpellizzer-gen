    "intro": "Glyceria distans var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant has slender, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, saturated soils. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
