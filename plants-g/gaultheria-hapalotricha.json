    "intro": "Gaultheria hapalotricha, commonly known as the hairy-leaved wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many shrubs and small trees adapted to acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside of the leaves. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by bright red berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. Gaultheria hapalotricha is also valued for its aromatic leaves, which contain compounds used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
