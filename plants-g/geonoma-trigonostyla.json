    "intro": "Geonoma trigonostyla, commonly known as the three-angled fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, triangular-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, lanceolate segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as tropical forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its leaves are covered in a thin layer of trichomes. Geonoma trigonostyla is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
