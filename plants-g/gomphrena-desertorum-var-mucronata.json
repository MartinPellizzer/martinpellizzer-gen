    "intro": "Gomphrena desertorum var. mucronata, commonly known as the desert bluemink, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its striking, papery blue to purple bract-like flowers that resemble tiny mink-like tails. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by colorful, leaf-like bracts, which are the primary ornamental feature. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal."
