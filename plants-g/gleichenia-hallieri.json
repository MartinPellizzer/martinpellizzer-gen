    "intro": "Gleichenia hallieri, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Gleicheniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that resemble a fern-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are divided into small, overlapping segments that give it a unique appearance. Gleichenia hallieri is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also significant in M\u0101ori cultural traditions."
