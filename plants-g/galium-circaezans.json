    "intro": "Galium circaezans, commonly known as creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Galium circaezans thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
