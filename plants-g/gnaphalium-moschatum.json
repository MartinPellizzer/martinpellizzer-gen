    "intro": "Gnaphalium moschatum, commonly known as sweet everlasting, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to North America and is characterized by its small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides."
