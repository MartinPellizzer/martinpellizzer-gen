    "intro": "Glycine \u00d7 gracilis var. nigra, commonly known as the black sicklepod, is a variant of the sicklepod genus Glycine. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with dark green, glossy foliage. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, followed by narrow, elongated pods. Its dark-colored foliage and unique growth habit make it a distinctive addition to botanical collections. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to warm, temperate climates."
