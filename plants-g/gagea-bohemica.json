    "intro": "Gagea bohemica, commonly known as the Bohemian spring beauty, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors and is adapted to temperate climates. Gagea bohemica produces small, fleshy bulbs that serve as storage organs for nutrients. Its blooming period occurs in early spring, making it an early indicator of seasonal change in its natural habitat."
