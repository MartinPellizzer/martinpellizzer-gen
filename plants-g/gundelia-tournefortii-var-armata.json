    "intro": "Gundelia tournefortii var. armata, commonly known as the mountain fennel, is a perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of the Mediterranean region. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with silver-gray, hairy foliage that helps it withstand harsh, arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early spring. Its fibrous root system is adapted to retain moisture in poor, rocky soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging environments."
