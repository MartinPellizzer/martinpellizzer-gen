    "intro": "Gonocarpus urceolatus, commonly known as the cup-shaped sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is characterized by its distinctive, cup-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its root system is adapted to tolerate saline and sandy soils, making it a hardy species in coastal environments. Gonocarpus urceolatus plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small marine organisms."
