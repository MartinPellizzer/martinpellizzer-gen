    "intro": "Gaylussacia, commonly known as the huckleberry plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the Ericaceae family. These shrubs are native to North America and are characterized by their small, acidic berries. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a leathery texture and are often arranged alternately on the stems. Gaylussacia species thrive in acidic, well-drained soils and are often found in forested areas. They play an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals."
