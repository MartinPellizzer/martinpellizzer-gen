    "intro": "Gaultheria buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and heathers. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. Gaultheria buxifolia produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
