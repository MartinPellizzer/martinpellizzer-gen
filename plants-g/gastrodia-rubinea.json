    "intro": "Gastrodia rubinea, commonly known as the red gastrodia, is a unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces a distinctive red, fleshy rhizome that is often harvested for traditional medicinal purposes. Its flowers are typically small and white or pink, arranged in a spike-like cluster. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Gastrodia rubinea is considered a rare and endangered species."
