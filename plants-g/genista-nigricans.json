It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by dark, woody pods containing seeds. Its thorny stems and evergreen foliage make it a distinctive and often invasive species in certain regions. It thrives in a variety of soils but prefers well-drained, sunny locations."
