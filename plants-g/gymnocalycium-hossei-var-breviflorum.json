    "intro": "Gymnocalycium hossei var. breviflorum, commonly known as the short-flowered moon cactus, is a species of cactus native to Argentina. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is typically covered in a dense layer of white to pale blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by pale green, ribbed fruits. It is a succulent plant that stores water in its fleshy stem, allowing it to survive in arid environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
