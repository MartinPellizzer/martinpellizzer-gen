    "intro": "Galium minutulum, commonly known as lesser bedstraw, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender stems that are often prostrate or ascending, with small, opposite leaves that are usually rounded or ovate. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale pink, and arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Galium minutulum is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in early successional habitats."
