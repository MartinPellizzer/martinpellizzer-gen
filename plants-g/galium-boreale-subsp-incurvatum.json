    "intro": "Galium boreale subsp. incurvatum, commonly known as the bent-stem bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats with slender, often curved stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly wavy margin. Small white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters during the summer, and the plant produces small, three-lobed berries that are dispersed by birds. It thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is an important component of tundra and subarctic ecosystems."
