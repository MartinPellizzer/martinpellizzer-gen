It is characterized by its striking red or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It is native to parts of Europe, particularly in regions such as Spain and Portugal. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
