    "intro": "Gleichenia abscida, commonly known as the brittle fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white\u8338\u6bdb, giving it a soft appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Gleichenia abscida is known for its ability to thrive in humid climates and its role in maintaining ecological balance in forest ecosystems."
