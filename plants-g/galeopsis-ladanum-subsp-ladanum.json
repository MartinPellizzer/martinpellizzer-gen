    "intro": "Galeopsis ladanum subsp. ladanum, commonly known as common hedge nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed capsule that disperses seeds via wind. It is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
