    "intro": "Gomphocarpus schinzianus, commonly known as the Schinz's milkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features showy, yellow-orange flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that split open to release seeds with silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its milky sap contains latex, which is characteristic of the milkweed genus."
