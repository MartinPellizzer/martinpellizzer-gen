    "intro": "Gnaphalium glabrum, commonly known as silverleaf woollyhead, is a flowering plant native to various regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is low-growing, with silver-gray foliage that reflects light and helps reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically grouped into clusters, and it produces fluffy, white to pale yellow seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Gnaphalium glabrum is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
