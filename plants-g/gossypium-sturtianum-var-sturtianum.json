It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant produces fluffy, white cotton-like fibers that are covered in fine hairs, which are used in traditional Aboriginal practices. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. This species is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its unique adaptations and ecological significance."
