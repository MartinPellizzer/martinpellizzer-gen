It is a member of the Menispermaceae family, which includes several species of climbing plants. The plant features compound leaves with opposite arrangement and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and it thrives in moist, wooded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
