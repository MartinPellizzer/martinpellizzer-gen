It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to saline and brackish environments, often found in tidal marshes and coastal dunes. Its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations makes it an important component of salt marsh ecosystems. Glyceria maritima var. virescens plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
