    "intro": "Goodyera zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's gesneriad, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, intricately shaped flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or among leaf litter. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
