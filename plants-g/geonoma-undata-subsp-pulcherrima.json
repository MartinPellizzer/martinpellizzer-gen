    "intro": "Geonoma undata subsp. pulcherrima, commonly known as the red-veined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, deeply divided fronds that often display a vibrant red or orange vein pattern against a green background. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rhizomes are typically short and produce numerous stolons, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round foliage and making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
