    "intro": "Glechoma curvidens, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive scalloped edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Glechoma curvidens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread quickly, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in gardens."
