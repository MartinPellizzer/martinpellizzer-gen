    "intro": "Grossularia velutina, commonly known as the velvet pomegranate, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It produces small, bright red berries that are similar in appearance to pomegranates but are generally smaller and less tart. The plant is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. The berries are edible and have a sweet, slightly tangy flavor, making them a valued plant in local horticulture."
