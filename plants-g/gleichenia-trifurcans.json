    "intro": "Gleichenia trifurcans, commonly known as the three-branch fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically divided into three branches, giving it its common name. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the fronds. Gleichenia trifurcans is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
