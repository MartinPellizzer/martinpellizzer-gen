It is characterized by its woody stems, scale-like leaves, and unique reproductive structures. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with a distinctive three-lobed shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it an important subject in the study of gymnosperm-like characteristics in angiosperms."
