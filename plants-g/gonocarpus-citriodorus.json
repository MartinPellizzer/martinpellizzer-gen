    "intro": "Gonocarpus citriodorus, commonly known as the lemon thyme or citronella grass, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves and is often cultivated for its essential oils. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread readily in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in green or reddish hues. Gonocarpus citriodorus is valued in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent due to its volatile compounds."
