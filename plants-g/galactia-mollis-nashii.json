It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant for soil enrichment in degraded areas."
