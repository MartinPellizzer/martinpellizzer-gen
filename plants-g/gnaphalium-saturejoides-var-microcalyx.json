It is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers and hairy, often gray-green foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. It produces small, cylindrical seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. This variant is distinguished by its smaller calyx compared to other varieties within the species."
