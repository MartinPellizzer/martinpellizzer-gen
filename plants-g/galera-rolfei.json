    "intro": "Galera rolfei, commonly known as the Rolfe's galera, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Galera rolfei is considered a species of conservation concern."
