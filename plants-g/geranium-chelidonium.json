It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant contains various alkaloids, including chelidonine, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found along stream banks and in woodland areas. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been the subject of both traditional and modern pharmacological studies."
