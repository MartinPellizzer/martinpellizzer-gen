    "intro": "Gigantochloa novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea giant bamboo, is a tall, perennial grass native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It is characterized by its robust culms, which can grow up to 10 meters in height, and its broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces inflorescences that are typically clustered and contain small, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests and disturbed areas. Due to its strong growth and structural properties, it is sometimes used in traditional construction and as a source of sustainable materials."
