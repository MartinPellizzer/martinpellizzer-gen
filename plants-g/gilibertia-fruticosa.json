    "intro": "Gilibertia fruticosa, commonly known as the Brazilian buttercup, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive cup-shaped structure, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are capsules that release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Gilibertia fruticosa is often found in dry, disturbed habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions."
