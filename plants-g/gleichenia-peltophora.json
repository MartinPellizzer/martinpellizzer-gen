    "intro": "Gleichenia peltophora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a layer of tiny, scale-like structures. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its sporangia are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Gleichenia peltophora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
