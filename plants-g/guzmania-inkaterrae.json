    "intro": "Guzmania inkaterrae, commonly known as the Inkaterra guzmania, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many tropical plants with colorful inflorescences. The plant features a rosette of waxy, strap-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. Its vibrant red and orange flowers appear at the center of the rosette, adding to its ornamental value. Guzmania inkaterrae thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush appearance."
