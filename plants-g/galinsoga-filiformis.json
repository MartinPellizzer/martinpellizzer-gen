    "intro": "Galinsoga filiformis, commonly known as common galinsoga, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits called achene. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a weed in many regions."
