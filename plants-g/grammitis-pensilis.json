    "intro": "Grammitis pensilis, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, wiry fronds that hang from trees or rocks. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its rhizomes and leaf surfaces. Its small, linear leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern, creating a dense, feathery appearance. Grammitis pensilis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests."
