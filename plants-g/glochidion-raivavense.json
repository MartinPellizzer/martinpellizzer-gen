    "intro": "Glochidion raivavense, commonly known as the Rapa Iti hibiscus, is a small shrub native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange or red fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing on rocky substrates or in disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
