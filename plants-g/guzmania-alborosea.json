    "intro": "Guzmania alborosea, commonly known as the white rose guzmania, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that resembles a rose, often displaying shades of white, pink, and red. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater in a central cup, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its foliage is typically bright green with a waxy texture, enhancing its ornamental appeal. Guzmania alborosea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush appearance."
