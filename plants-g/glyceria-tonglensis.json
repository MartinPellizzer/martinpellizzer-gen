It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, producing small, two-lobed flowers. Glyceria tonglensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
