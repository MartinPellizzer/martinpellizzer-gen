    "intro": "Gynerium sagittatum var. glabrum, commonly known as arrowhead plant, is a perennial herb native to wetland areas of North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and glabrous, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spikes during the summer months. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
