    "intro": "Gonzalagunia pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered gonzalagunia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are ovate with hairy surfaces, and it produces small, woody capsules as fruit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
