    "intro": "Grevillea pinnatisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waratah, is a striking shrub native to New South Wales, Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces showy, crimson or orange-red flower spikes that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences and are pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters. Grevillea pinnatisecta is well-suited to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens."
