    "intro": "Galium palustre var. effusum, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a soft, hairy texture. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks."
