It is characterized by its large, showy purple or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and can grow quite long, often reaching several meters in length. Its roots are deep and strong, allowing it to climb and anchor itself to various structures. Glycine macrophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often used in gardens and as a decorative element in landscapes."
