    "intro": "Gypsophila nana, commonly known as baby's breath, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, lace-like flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and lavender, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray foliage that adds texture to garden landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Gypsophila nana is also widely used in floral arrangements due to its abundance of small, fluffy blooms."
