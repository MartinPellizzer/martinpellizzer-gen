It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its unique, winged bracts that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Gyrostachys pterygantha is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
