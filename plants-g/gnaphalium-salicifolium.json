    "intro": "Gnaphalium salicifolium, commonly known as willow-leaved cudweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features slender, willow-like leaves that are opposite and covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Its small, yellowish flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Gnaphalium salicifolium thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
