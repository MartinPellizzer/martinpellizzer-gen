    "intro": "Guzmania glomerata, commonly known as the clustered flamingo flower, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy inflorescence that resembles a cluster of red flowers, which can last for several months. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool that supports small aquatic life. Guzmania glomerata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to maintain its lush appearance. It is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
