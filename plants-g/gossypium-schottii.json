    "intro": "Gossypium schottii, commonly known as the Schott's cotton, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its soft, fluffy fibers that resemble cotton. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with simple, alternate leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers. Its fibrous seeds are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its native environment."
