It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and have a distinctive wintergreen scent when crushed. Gaultheria dolichopoda thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments."
