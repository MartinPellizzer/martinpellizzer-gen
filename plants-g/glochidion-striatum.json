    "intro": "Glochidion striatum, commonly known as the rough-leafed glabrous wood vine, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy or rough to the touch. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is typically found in moist, shaded forest environments. Glochidion striatum is also notable for its ability to climb using its twining stems, often found along tree trunks or shrubs in its natural habitat."
