    "intro": "Gomphocarpus acerateoides, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces showy yellow flowers clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas."
