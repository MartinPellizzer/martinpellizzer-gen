    "intro": "Goldfussia flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible goldenweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of North America. It features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats on the ground, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in wetland environments. Goldfussia flexuosa is adapted to waterlogged conditions and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
