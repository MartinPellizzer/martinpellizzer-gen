    "intro": "Gymnogramma setulosa, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Gymnogramma setulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
