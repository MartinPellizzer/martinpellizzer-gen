    "intro": "Goniopteris rigida, commonly known as the rigid shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, rigid texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common in many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Goniopteris rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
