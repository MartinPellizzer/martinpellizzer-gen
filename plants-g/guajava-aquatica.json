    "intro": "Guajava aquatica, commonly known as water guajava, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow water bodies such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense underwater vegetation. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, aiding in photosynthesis. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in spikes, and it produces fleshy, red berries that are edible for both humans and wildlife. Guajava aquatica plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
