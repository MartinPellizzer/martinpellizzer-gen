    "intro": "Goniopteris munchii, commonly known as the Munch's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in the soil. The fronds are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions, a unique trait that aids in its ecological interactions."
