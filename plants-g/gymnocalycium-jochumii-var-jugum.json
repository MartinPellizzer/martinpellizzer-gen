    "intro": "Gymnocalycium jochumii var. jugum, commonly known as the Jochum's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Argentina. It is characterized by its globose, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It has a slow growth rate and is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
