    "intro": "Guioa villosa, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape and covered with a fine, silky pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Guioa villosa thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along stream banks. Its unique foliage and adaptability make it a valuable ornamental and ecological plant in its native habitat."
