    "intro": "Glochidion camiguinense, commonly known as the Camiguin hibiscus, is a shrub native to the Philippines, specifically the island of Camiguin. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
