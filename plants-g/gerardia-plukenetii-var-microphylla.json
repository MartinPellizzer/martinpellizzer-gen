    "intro": "Gerardia plukenetii var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf gerardia, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale purple flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a desirable ground cover. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinators."
