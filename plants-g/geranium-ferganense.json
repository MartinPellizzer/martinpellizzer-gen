The plant typically features lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of bright red or pink blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
