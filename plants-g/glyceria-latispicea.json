    "intro": "Glyceria latispicea, commonly known as broad-leaved glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Glyceria latispicea thrives in saturated soils and is often found in riparian zones and seasonally flooded areas. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
