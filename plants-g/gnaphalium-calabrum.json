    "intro": "Gnaphalium calabrum, commonly known as the Calabrian cudweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Gnaphalium calabrum is also noted for its aromatic foliage, which contains volatile oils."
