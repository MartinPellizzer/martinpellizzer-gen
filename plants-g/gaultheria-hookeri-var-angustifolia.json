    "intro": "Gaultheria hookeri var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a sharp, spicy flavor due to the presence of methyl salicylate. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky outcrops."
