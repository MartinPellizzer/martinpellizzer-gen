    "intro": "Genista myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtleleaf broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are often mistaken for those of the myrtle tree due to their similar appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or coastal environments. Genista myrtifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
