    "intro": "Grammitis liesneri, commonly known as the Schomburgk's fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of forests. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a smooth margin and are arranged in a compact rosette pattern. Grammitis liesneri is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage."
