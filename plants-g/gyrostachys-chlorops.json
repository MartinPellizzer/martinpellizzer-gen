    "intro": "Gyrostachys chlorops, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Gyrostachys chlorops thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
