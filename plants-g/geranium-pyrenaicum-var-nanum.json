    "intro": "Geranium pyrenaicum var. nanum, commonly known as the Pyrenean geranium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, palmately lobed leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
