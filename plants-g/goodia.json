    "intro": "Goodia, commonly known as the goodia or the goodia tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. Goodia species are often drought-tolerant, making them well-suited for harsh environmental conditions. Their ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various native fauna."
