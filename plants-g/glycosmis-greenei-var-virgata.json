    "intro": "Glycosmis greenei var. virgata, commonly known as the Virgin's glory, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
