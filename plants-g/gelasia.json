    "intro": "Gelasia, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically herbaceous, with leaves that are often lobed or toothed, and they produce small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. Gelasia species are native to various regions of the Americas, particularly in temperate climates. They are often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. The plant's structure and growth habits make it adaptable to a range of environmental conditions."
