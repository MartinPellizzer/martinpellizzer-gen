    "intro": "Genista parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian broom, is a flowering plant native to the high mountain regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
