    "intro": "Guneria, commonly known as the African star gooseberry, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs native to southern Africa. The plants are characterized by their evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. They produce small, berry-like fruits that are often edible and have a tart flavor. Guneria species are typically found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
