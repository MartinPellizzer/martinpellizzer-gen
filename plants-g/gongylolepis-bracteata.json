    "intro": "Gongylolepis bracteata, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a notable characteristic of its botanical makeup. Gongylolepis bracteata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
