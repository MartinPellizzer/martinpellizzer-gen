    "intro": "Gentiana concinna var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The elongated gentian is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
