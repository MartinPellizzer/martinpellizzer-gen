    "intro": "Glochidion anthopotamicum, commonly known as the Philippine glochidion, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits that contain minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as montane forests and is often found in secondary growth areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
