    "intro": "Gaura sinuata, commonly known as the zigzag gaura, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly zigzagged edge, giving it a distinctive appearance. Gaura sinuata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
