    "intro": "Gagea jensii, commonly known as the mountain gagea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a single white or pale pink flower per stem, often with a distinct scent. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
