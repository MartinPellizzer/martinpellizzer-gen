It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant has small, opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy and slightly curled at the edges. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense heads, and are typically white or pale yellow, giving it a delicate appearance. It is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, and is known for its ability to thrive in poor, dry conditions."
