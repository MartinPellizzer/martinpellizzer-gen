    "intro": "Gilia demissa, commonly known as the desert gilia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its slender, branching stems and narrow leaves are adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions. Gilia demissa plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its resilience and beauty."
