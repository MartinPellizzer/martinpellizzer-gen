    "intro": "Goniophlebium scouleri, commonly known as the Pacific silver fern, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, silver-green fronds that are often covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Goniophlebium scouleri is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
