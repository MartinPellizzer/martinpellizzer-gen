    "intro": "Guzmania desautelsii, commonly known as the Desautels\u2019 bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage that collects water, creating a small ecosystem. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, adding visual interest. Its leaves are typically broad and strap-like, with a waxy texture that helps in water retention. Guzmania desautelsii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
