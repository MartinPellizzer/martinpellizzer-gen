It is a low-growing, perennial shrub characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically produces violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens and landscapes."
