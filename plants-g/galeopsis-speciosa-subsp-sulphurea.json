It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The subspecies sulphurea is distinguished by its more yellowish floral bracts compared to the typical form."
