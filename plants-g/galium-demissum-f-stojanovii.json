    "intro": "Galium demissum f. stojanovii, commonly known as the Stojanovii bedstraw, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the bedstraw genus. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
