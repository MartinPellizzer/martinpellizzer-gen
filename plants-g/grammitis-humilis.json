    "intro": "Grammitis humilis, commonly known as the small grammitis, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like appearance. It is a small epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, lanceolate leaves that are usually green and covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Grammitis humilis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
