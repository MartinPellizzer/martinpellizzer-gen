It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a slender, creeping rhizome with lance-shaped, finely toothed fronds. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Gymnopteris minor is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in forest understories."
