    "intro": "Galium aparine, commonly known as cleavers, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively. The plant has small, opposite leaves with notched edges and produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release seeds when disturbed. Cleavers are often found in moist, disturbed soils and are known for their medicinal and ecological significance."
