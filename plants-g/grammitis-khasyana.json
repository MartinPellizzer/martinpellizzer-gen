    "intro": "Grammitis khasyana, commonly known as the Khasi grammitis, is a fern native to the northeastern region of India. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps anchor it to substrates. The fronds are usually elongated and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive pattern of sori on the underside."
