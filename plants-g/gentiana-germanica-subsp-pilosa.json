    "intro": "Gentiana germanica subsp. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, giving it its subspecies name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
