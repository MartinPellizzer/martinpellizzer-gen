    "intro": "Geum humile, commonly known as creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Geum humile is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to spread easily."
