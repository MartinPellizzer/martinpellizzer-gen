    "intro": "Gyrostachys stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf gyrostachys, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, characterized by its upright, branching structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Gyrostachys stricta is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds."
