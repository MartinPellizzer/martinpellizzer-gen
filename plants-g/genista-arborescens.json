    "intro": "Genista arborescens, commonly known as the creeping broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems that grow close to the ground, forming a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and needle-like, and it is often used in landscaping for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils. Genista arborescens is also known for its potential as a nitrogen-fixing plant, making it beneficial for soil improvement."
