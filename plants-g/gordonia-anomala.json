    "intro": "Gordonia anomala, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to West Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and large, glossy leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the rainy season, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an important species for ecological and economic reasons."
