    "intro": "Grammitis isertii, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, rounded clusters on the underside of the fronds. Grammitis isertii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
