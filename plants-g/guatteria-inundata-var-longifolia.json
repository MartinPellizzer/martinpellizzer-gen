It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by yellowish fruits resembling small cherries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
