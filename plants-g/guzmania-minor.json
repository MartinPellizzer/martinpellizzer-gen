    "intro": "Guzmania minor, commonly known as the dwarf flamingo flower, is a terrestrial bromeliad native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect rainwater, which serves as a microhabitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that resemble a flamingo's beak, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Guzmania minor is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
