It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant relies on a host tree for water and nutrients, typically growing on the branches of eucalyptus or other hardwoods. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution."
