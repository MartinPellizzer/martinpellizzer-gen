It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth and the presence of stiff, bristle-like structures on its leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a distinct midrib, with a glossy, dark green surface. Grammitis setosora is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for microorganisms."
