    "intro": "Gueldenstaedtia multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered vicia, is a perennial legume native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, pea-like flowers in shades of violet or pink. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with oval leaflets and produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Gueldenstaedtia multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, benefiting soil fertility."
