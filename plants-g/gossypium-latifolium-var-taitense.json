    "intro": "Gossypium latifolium var. taitense, commonly known as the Taiti cotton or Taiti bollweed, is a variant of the cotton plant native to the Pacific islands. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and fluffy, white cotton-like bolls that develop at the nodes. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with hairy stems and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing fibrous seeds. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential for genetic diversity."
