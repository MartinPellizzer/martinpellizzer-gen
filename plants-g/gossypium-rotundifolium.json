    "intro": "Gossypium rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf cotton, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its round, fleshy leaves and produces fluffy, white fibers similar to those of other cotton species. It thrives in hot, dry climates and is adapted to poor soil conditions. The botanical features of Gossypium rotundifolium make it an interesting subject for study in plant physiology and ecological adaptation."
