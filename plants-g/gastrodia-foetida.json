    "intro": "Gastrodia foetida, commonly known as the stinking gastrodia, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous rhizomes and lacks true leaves, instead relying on its underground structures for photosynthesis. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly regions of China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula. It thrives in humid, shaded forest environments and is often found growing on the roots of other plants. Due to its medicinal properties and rarity, it is highly valued and endangered in the wild."
