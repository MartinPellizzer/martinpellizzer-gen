    "intro": "Gasteria repens, commonly known as the \"creeping gasteria,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with white or yellowish markings. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for dry environments. Gasteria repens is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact growth habit."
