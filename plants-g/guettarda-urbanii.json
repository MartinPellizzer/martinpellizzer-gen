    "intro": "Guettarda urbanii, commonly known as the coastal guettarda, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its dense foliage and ability to tolerate salt spray. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Guettarda urbanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in coastal landscaping due to its resilience in harsh environments."
