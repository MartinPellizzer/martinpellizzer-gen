    "intro": "Gagea lutea var. sylvatica, commonly known as the woodland gagea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in woodland habitats, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features a short, rhizomatous rootstock and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from the base of the plant. This species is notable for its early spring blooming habit and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
