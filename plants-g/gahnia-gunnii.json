    "intro": "Gahnia gunnii, commonly known as the Gunns' grass, is a perennial tussock-forming grass native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, upright clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often reddish in color. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in wetlands, swampy areas, and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Gahnia gunnii is also valued for its ornamental appeal in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and resilience."
