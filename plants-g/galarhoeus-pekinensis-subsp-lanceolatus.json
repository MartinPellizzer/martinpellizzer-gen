    "intro": "Galarhoeus pekinensis subsp. lanceolatus, commonly known as the Peking lanceleaf, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
