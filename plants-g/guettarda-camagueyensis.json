It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its fruit is a capsule that releases small seeds when mature. Guettarda camagueyensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
