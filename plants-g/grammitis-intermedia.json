    "intro": "Grammitis intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate grammitis, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small groups called sori. Grammitis intermedia is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a common species in tropical and subtropical regions."
