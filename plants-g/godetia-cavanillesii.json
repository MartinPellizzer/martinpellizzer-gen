    "intro": "Godetia cavanillesii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of violet or blue. The plant has hairy, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, adapting to the intense solar exposure. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
