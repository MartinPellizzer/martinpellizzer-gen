    "intro": "Geniostoma dasyneurum, commonly known as the rough-nerve fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are deeply divided and have a rough, serrated texture along the nerves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help in anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil. The leaves are usually evergreen, providing a consistent green presence throughout the year."
