    "intro": "Gymnadenia taquetii, commonly known as the Taquet's grass-pink, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the alpine regions of Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and the Alps, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are grass-like and basal, forming a rosette structure typical of many orchids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Gymnadenia taquetii is considered a species of conservation concern."
