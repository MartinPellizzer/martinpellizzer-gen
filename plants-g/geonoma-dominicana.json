    "intro": "Geonoma dominicana, commonly known as the Dominican ironwood, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, bushy canopy. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Geonoma dominicana is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
