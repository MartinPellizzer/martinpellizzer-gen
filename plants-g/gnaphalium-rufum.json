It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. Its small, pinkish to reddish flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant is known for its aromatic, often pungent scent. Gnaphalium rufum is also notable for its ability to produce a large number of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
