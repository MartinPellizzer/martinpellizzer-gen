    "intro": "Galatella chulbairica, commonly known as the Chulbair's galatella, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
