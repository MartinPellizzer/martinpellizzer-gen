    "intro": "Geranium alticola, commonly known as the alpine geranium, is a perennial flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh conditions of its habitat. Geranium alticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
