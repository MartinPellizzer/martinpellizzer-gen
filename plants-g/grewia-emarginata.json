    "intro": "Grewia emarginata, commonly known as the sour fig or wild mango, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red or yellow when mature. The fruits are edible, though they are often tart and used in local cuisines or for making jams. Grewia emarginata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
