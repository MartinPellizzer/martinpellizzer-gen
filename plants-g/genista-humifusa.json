    "intro": "Genista humifusa, commonly known as the creeping evergreen broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has wiry, thornless stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are narrow, evergreen, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
