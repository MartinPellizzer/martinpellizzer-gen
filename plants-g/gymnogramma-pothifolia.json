    "intro": "Gymnogramma pothifolia, commonly known as the creeping staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that form a rosette-like structure, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. Gymnogramma pothifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
