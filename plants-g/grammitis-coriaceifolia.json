    "intro": "Grammitis coriaceifolia, commonly known as the tough-leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green, and often crinkled leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes and absorbing moisture from the air. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that are densely arranged. Grammitis coriaceifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
