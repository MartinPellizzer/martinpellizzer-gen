    "intro": "Galium boreale var. leiocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, branching stems covered with small, opposite leaves that are usually oval to elliptical in shape. Its flowers are white or pale pink, borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
