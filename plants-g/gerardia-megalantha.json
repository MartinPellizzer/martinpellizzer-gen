    "intro": "Gerardia megalantha, commonly known as the giant gerardia, is a striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust growth habit. The plant features large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Gerardia megalantha is well adapted to coastal and rocky habitats, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
