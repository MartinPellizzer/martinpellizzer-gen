    "intro": "Gustavia macarenensis subsp. paucisperma, commonly known as the sparse-fruited guayacan, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced number of fruits compared to other members of the species. It typically grows in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The wood of this plant is valued for its strength and durability, though it is not widely used commercially."
