    "intro": "Gentiana prostrata var. crenulatotruncata, commonly known as the creeping gentian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a basal rosette of oval, dark green leaves with a waxy coating, and produces clusters of sky-blue to violet flowers during the summer months. The species is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that lie flat on the ground and bear the showy blooms. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
