It is characterized by its lack of a stem, with leaves directly emerging from the root system. The plant produces striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and botanical collections."
