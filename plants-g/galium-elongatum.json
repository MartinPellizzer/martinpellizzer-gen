    "intro": "Galium elongatum, commonly known as slender bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, ascending stems that are often hairy and can reach up to 60 cm in height. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
