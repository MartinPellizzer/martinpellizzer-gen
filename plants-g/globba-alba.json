    "intro": "Globba alba, commonly known as white ginger, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like ginger and turmeric. The plant features rhizomatous growth and produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Globba alba is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has mild medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
