    "intro": "Gonolobus ellipticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped to elliptical leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive veining pattern. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in the morning. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Gonolobus ellipticus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
