    "intro": "Geonoma schottiana var. palustris, commonly known as the swamp fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and wetlands. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while absorbing nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
