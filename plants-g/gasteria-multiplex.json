    "intro": "Gasteria multiplex, commonly known as the African snowball, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with white or silver markings. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, white, bell-shaped flowers. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. Gasteria multiplex is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
