    "intro": "Glycyrrhiza laxiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved licorice, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its roots, which contain glycyrrhizin, a compound used in traditional medicine and as a sweetener. Glycyrrhiza laxiflora thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
