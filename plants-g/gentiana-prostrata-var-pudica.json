    "intro": "Gentiana prostrata var. pudica, commonly known as the humble gentian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features delicate, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender stems that often lie close to the ground. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils."
