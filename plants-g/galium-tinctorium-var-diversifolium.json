It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves that vary in shape, contributing to its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage and flowers have been historically used in herbal medicine and dye production."
