    "intro": "Graumuellera, commonly known as the rock fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its woody shrubs or small trees with aromatic leaves. The plants typically have smooth, often greyish bark and produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pink. Graumuellera species are adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making them resilient in arid environments. They are also valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in horticulture."
