    "intro": "Genista stipulacea, commonly known as the stipule broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, often spiny stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in dense clusters during the spring, which are followed by long, narrow pods containing seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have small stipules at the base, giving it its common name. Genista stipulacea is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates."
