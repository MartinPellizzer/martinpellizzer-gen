    "intro": "Glyceria caspia, commonly known as Caspian glyceria, is a perennial grass species native to regions around the Caspian Sea. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense mats near the water's surface. Its narrow leaves are usually a few millimeters wide and have a grass-like appearance. Glyceria caspia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic wildlife."
