    "intro": "Galium denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually finely toothed, giving it the common name, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium denticulatum is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic properties."
