It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Galium tomentosum is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through rhizomes."
