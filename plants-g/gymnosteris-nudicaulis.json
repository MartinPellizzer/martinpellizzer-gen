    "intro": "Gymnosteris nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and small, bladder-like structures used for trapping prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water bodies such as ponds and marshes. It lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids. Gymnosteris nudicaulis is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting small aquatic organisms."
