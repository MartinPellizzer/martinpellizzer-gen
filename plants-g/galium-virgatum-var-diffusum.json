It features slender, stoloniferous stems that spread horizontally along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are typically white or pale green, blooming in early summer. Silverweed is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and woodland edges."
