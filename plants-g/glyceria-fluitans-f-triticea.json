    "intro": "Glyceria fluitans f. triticea, commonly known as the narrowleaf pondgrass, is a grassland plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial species that typically grows in wet or moist soils, such as marshes, stream banks, and lake margins. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its morphology is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with rhizomes that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed wetland habitats."
