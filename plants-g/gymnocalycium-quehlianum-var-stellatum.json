It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and ribbed structure. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is well adapted to arid environments. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
