It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy, and it produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
