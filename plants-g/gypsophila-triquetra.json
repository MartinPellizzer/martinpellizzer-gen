    "intro": "Gypsophila triquetra, commonly known as the mountain flax or three-angled gypsophila, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight waxy coating to reduce water loss. Gypsophila triquetra is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
