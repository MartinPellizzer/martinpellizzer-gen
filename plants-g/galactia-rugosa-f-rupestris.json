    "intro": "Galactia rugosa f. rupestris, commonly known as the rock hedge bean, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
