    "intro": "Gladiolus rogersii var. graminifolius, commonly known as the grass-leaved gladiolus, is a rare and striking member of the Iridaceae family native to the southeastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that bear showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, giving it its common name, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
