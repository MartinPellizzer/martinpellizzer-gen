    "intro": "Gnaphalium aecidiocephalum, commonly known as the woolly cudweed, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish-white woolly coating on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in compact clusters, typical of the Compositae family. It is native to regions of southern Africa and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its botanical features make it well adapted to dry, coastal or inland habitats."
