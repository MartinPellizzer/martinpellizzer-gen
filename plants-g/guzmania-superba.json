    "intro": "Guzmania superba, commonly known as the royal torch plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescence that resembles a torch, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and insects. Its roots are relatively shallow, allowing it to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Guzmania superba is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
