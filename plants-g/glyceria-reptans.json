    "intro": "Glyceria reptans, commonly known as the creeping glyceria, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in regions with high humidity and saturated soils. Glyceria reptans plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
