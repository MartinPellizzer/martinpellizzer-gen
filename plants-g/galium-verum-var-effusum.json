    "intro": "Galium verum var. effusum, commonly known as yellow bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground, covered in small, opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
