    "intro": "Gleichenia compacta, commonly known as the compact fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that form a rosette-like structure, often growing close to the ground. The plant typically has a rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. It is native to various regions in the Southern Hemisphere, including parts of South America, Africa, and Australia. Gleichenia compacta is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas."
