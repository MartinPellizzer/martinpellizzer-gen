    "intro": "Galium angustifolium var. subglabrum, commonly known as narrow-leaved bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce small, white or pinkish flowers. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy surface, though the variety subglabrum is distinguished by its reduced hairiness. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This plant is often found in the understory of forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect life."
