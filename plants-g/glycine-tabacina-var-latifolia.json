    "intro": "Glycine tabacina var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sensitive plant, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, white or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are encased in hairy pods that split open when mature. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage movements."
