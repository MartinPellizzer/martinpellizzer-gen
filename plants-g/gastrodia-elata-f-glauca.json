    "intro": "Gastrodia elata f. glauca, commonly known as the blue-flowered arrowroot, is a rare and ornamental variant of the gastrodia plant. It is characterized by its unique bluish hue on the flower bracts, distinguishing it from the typical green or yellow varieties. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China, where it thrives in cool, shaded environments. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its aesthetic appeal in horticulture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
