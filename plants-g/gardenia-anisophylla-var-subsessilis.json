    "intro": "Gardenia anisophylla var. subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved gardenia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Gardenia anisophylla. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers with yellow stamens, which bloom during the summer months. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation in warm climates. The varietal form subsessilis is distinguished by its shorter pedicels, giving the flowers a more clustered appearance."
