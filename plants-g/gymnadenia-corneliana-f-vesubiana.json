    "intro": "Gymnadenia corneliana f. vesubiana, commonly known as the Vesuvius orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the volcanic regions of southern Italy. This orchid is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant's floral structure is typical of the Orchidaceae family, featuring three sepals, three petals, and a prominent lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
