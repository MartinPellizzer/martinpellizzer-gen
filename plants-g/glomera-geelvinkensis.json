    "intro": "Glomera geelvinkensis, commonly known as the Geelvink's glomera, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant has elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy, with a slightly waxy texture. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, and it is primarily pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
