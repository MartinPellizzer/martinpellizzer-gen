    "intro": "Gagea bulbifera var. armena, commonly known as Armenian spring beauty, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It produces delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its underground bulbs, which store nutrients and allow it to survive harsh winter conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
