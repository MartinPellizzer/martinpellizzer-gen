    "intro": "Gymnogramma involuta, commonly known as the curled spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often curled or twisted. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread through the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Gymnogramma involuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique foliage."
