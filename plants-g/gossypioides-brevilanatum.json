    "intro": "Gossypioides brevilanatum, commonly known as the small-leaved cottonwood, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, woolly flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. Its fibrous bark and leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Gossypioides brevilanatum plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
