It features fleshy, upright stems covered in small, overlapping leaves that are typically green or bluish-green. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
