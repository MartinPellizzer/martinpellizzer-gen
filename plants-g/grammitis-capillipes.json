    "intro": "Grammitis capillipes, commonly known as the slender hair-grammitis, is a fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair-like structures. This plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests and moist mountain regions. Its rhizomes are slender and often form dense mats on rocks or decaying logs. Grammitis capillipes is notable for its small, clustered spore-producing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its fronds."
