It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers, which are typically white or pale blue in color. The plants are native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Glaziova species are often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their delicate appearance."
