    "intro": "Pappostipa vaginata f. rigida, commonly known as the rigid false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its stiff, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
