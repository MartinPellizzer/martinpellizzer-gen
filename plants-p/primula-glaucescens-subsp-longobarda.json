    "intro": "Primula glaucescens subsp. longobarda, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of lanceolate, glaucous leaves that are covered in a whitish waxy coating, which helps to reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is cultivated in gardens and protected in its natural habitat."
