    "intro": "Prunus persica f. albaplena, commonly known as the white-flowered peach. This cultivar is a variation of the common peach, characterized by its abundant white blooms that cover the entire tree, giving it a striking appearance. The flowers are typically larger and more numerous than those of the standard peach, enhancing its ornamental value. It produces small, yellow peaches that are often less flavorful than typical peaches, making it more suitable for\u89c2\u8d4f rather than culinary use. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sunlight for optimal growth."
