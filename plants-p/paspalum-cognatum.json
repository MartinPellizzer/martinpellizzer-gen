    "intro": "Paspalum cognatum, commonly known as the Florida paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, and thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often pink or reddish in color. It is well adapted to wet conditions and can tolerate periodic flooding. Paspalum cognatum is often found in association with other wetland plants and plays a role in stabilizing soil in these environments."
