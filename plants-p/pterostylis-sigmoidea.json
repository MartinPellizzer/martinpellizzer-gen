    "intro": "Pterostylis sigmoidea, commonly known as the zigzag ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that resemble a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanical research."
