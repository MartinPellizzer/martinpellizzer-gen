    "intro": "Prunus pleiocerasus, commonly known as the Japanese cherry plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, sweet-tart fruits that are edible but not as commonly consumed as other cherry varieties. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth texture, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Prunus pleiocerasus is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and seasonal flowering."
