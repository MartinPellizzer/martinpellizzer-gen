It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, elliptical leaves that have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
