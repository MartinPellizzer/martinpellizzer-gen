    "intro": "Picea linzhiensis, commonly known as the Linzhi fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are densely packed. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous forest ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
