    "intro": "Pagamea montana, commonly known as the mountain pagamea, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh mountain conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Pagamea montana produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
