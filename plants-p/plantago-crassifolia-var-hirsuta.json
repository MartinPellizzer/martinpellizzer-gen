    "intro": "Plantago crassifolia var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy broadleaf plantain, is a variant of the broadleaf plantain species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides or in meadows. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are wind-pollinated. This variant is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
