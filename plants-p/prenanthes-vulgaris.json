    "intro": "Prenanthes vulgaris, commonly known as the common water hemlock, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, but it is highly toxic due to the presence of cicutoxin. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. Due to its toxicity, it is important to avoid contact with any part of the plant."
