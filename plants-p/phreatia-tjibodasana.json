    "intro": "Phreatia tjibodasana, commonly known as the Tjibodasana orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
