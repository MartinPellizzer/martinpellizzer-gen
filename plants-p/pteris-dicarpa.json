    "intro": "Pteris dicarpa, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread through the undergrowth, making it a common sight in moist, forested areas. Pteris dicarpa is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its role in traditional medicine in some cultures."
