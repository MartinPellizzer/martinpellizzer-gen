    "intro": "Polypodium camporum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Polypodium camporum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its attractive foliage."
