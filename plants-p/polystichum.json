    "intro": "Polystichum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a genus of ferns that includes over 300 species. These plants are characterized by their feather-like fronds, which are typically evergreen and can grow to significant lengths. Polystichum species are native to a wide range of regions, including Asia, Africa, and the Americas, and they thrive in moist, shaded environments. They have a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing them to spread and form dense clumps. Many species are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in garden settings."
