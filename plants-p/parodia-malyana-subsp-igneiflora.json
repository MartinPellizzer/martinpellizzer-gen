    "intro": "Parodia malyana subsp. igneiflora, commonly known as the fire-flowered cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Brazil. It features a short, thick stem with a ribbed structure and produces vibrant orange to red flowers during the warmer months. The plant has a dense covering of white to grayish hairs, which help protect it from excessive sunlight and moisture loss. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its striking appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in succulent gardens."
