    "intro": "Psephellus kolakovskyi, commonly known as the Kolakovsky's psephellus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces yellowish to white ray florets surrounded by tubular disk florets, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
