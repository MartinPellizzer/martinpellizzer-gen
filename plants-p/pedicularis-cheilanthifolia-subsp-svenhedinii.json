    "intro": "Pedicularis cheilanthifolia subsp. svenhedinii, commonly known as the Svenhedin's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while performing photosynthesis. It thrives in rocky, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
