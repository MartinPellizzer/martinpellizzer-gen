    "intro": "Picrita, commonly known as the yellow poppy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Papaveraceae. It consists of several species, most notably Picris hieracioides, which is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, and the plant thrives in dry, sunny habitats. Picrita is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, making it a common weed in some regions."
