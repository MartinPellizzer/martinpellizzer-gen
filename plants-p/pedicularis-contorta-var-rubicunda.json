    "intro": "Pedicularis contorta var. rubicunda, commonly known as the red monkey orchid, is a striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its vibrant red flowers with a distinctive hooded shape, which are often adorned with yellow and purple markings. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in alpine ecosystems."
