    "intro": "Phalaris pruinosa, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, bluish-gray leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces small, greenish to brownish spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and coastal areas. Phalaris pruinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
