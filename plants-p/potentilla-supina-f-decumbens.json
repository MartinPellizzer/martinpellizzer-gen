It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has rounded, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and slopes. This variety is known for its hardiness and ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion."
