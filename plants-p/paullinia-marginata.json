    "intro": "Paullinia marginata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces orange-red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in certain regions."
