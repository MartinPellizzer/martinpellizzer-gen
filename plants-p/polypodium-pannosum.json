    "intro": "Polypodium pannosum, commonly known as the broad-leafed polypody, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, broadly ovate, and often hairy fronds. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Its fronds are usually divided into segments with a serrated or lobed margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Polypodium pannosum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability and supporting biodiversity."
