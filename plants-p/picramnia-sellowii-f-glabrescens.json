    "intro": "Picramnia sellowii f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaved picramnia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
