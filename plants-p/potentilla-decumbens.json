    "intro": "Potentilla decumbens, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its prostrate or decumbent growth habit, with many stems lying close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Potentilla decumbens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
