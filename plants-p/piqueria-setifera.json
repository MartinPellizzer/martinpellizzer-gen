    "intro": "Piqueria setifera, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants such as hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Piqueria setifera is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions, making it an important component of its native ecosystem."
