    "intro": "Perymenium gracile, commonly known as the slender perymenium, is a lesser-known flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, umbrella-like clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of the carrot family. Perymenium gracile is notable for its subtle fragrance and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
