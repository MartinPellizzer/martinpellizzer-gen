It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is characterized by its stinging hairs that cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that have serrated edges. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The flowering stems bear small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences."
