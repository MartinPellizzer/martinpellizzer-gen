    "intro": "Puccinellia sibirica, commonly known as Siberian glassworts, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. Puccinellia sibirica is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it an important component of tundra and arctic ecosystems."
