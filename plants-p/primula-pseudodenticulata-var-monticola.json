    "intro": "Primula pseudodenticulata var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive yellow throat. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from cold temperatures. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
