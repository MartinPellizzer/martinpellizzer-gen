It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into woody, three-lobed fruits. Its leaves are often used for thatching and weaving, while the roots are valued for their medicinal properties. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is well adapted to saline and humid environments."
