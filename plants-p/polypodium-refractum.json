    "intro": "Polypodium refractum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. Polypodium refractum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
