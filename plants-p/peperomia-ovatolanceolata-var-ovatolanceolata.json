    "intro": "Peperomia ovatolanceolata var. ovatolanceolata, commonly known as the broad-leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features ovate to lanceolate leaves that are glossy and often have a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically green or red, which are followed by elongated, spindle-shaped fruits. Its foliage is characterized by a dense, upright growth habit and a preference for well-draining soil. It is valued in horticulture for its attractive leaves and relatively low maintenance requirements."
