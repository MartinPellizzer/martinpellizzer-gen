    "intro": "Passiflora suberosa var. perhastata, commonly known as the rough-stemmed passionflower, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody, rough-textured stems and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces striking flowers with five sepals, five petals, and a distinctive crown of filaments surrounding the reproductive structures. Its fruit, a red, fleshy capsule, contains numerous seeds and is often consumed by wildlife. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and fruit-eating animals."
