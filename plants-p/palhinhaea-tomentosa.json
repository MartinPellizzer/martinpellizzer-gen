    "intro": "Palhinhaea tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly palhinhaea, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in dense inflorescences, and are usually white or pale pink in color. Palhinhaea tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
