    "intro": "Polypodium wallichianum, commonly known as the Himalayan shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions of Asia. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
