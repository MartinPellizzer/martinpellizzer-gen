    "intro": "Polygonum crassum var. magnum, commonly known as giant knotweed, is a vigorous perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 20 cm in diameter, with a coarse, rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, sturdy stems. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in non-native regions."
