    "intro": "Phyllopodium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf shield fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, shield-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Phyllopodium pumilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
