    "intro": "Pernettya pentlandii subvar. humilis, commonly known as the lowland cowberry, is a dwarf shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with stems that often lie prostrate on the ground. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by edible, red berries similar to blueberries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
