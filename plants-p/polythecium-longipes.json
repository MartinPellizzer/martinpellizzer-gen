    "intro": "Polythecium longipes, commonly known as the long-stalked polypore, is a species of fungus in the family Polyporaceae. It is characterized by its tough, woody fruiting body that typically grows on dead or decaying wood. The cap is usually pale to dark brown, with a distinctive, irregular surface and small, scattered pores instead of gills. It is often found in temperate forests and is a saprophytic fungus that plays a role in decomposing organic matter. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to mycologists and fungal enthusiasts."
