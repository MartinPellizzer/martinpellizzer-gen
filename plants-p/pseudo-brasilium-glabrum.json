    "intro": "Pseudo-brasilium glabrum, commonly known as the smooth pseudo-brasilium, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial with hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to white, bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires warm, humid conditions to thrive."
