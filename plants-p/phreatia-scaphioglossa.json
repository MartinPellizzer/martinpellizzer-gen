    "intro": "Phreatia scaphioglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, tropical environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is narrow and elongated. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to biodiversity and providing resources for pollinators."
