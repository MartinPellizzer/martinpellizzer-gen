    "intro": "Paysonia lasiocarpa subsp. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the roughleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in dry, rocky habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its rough, hairy texture on the stems and leaves, contributing to its ecological resilience."
