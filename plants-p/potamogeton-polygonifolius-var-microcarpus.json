    "intro": "Potamogeton polygonifolius var. microcarpus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It has long, slender leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, with a smooth surface and a waxy coating. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Its roots form dense mats that can stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic life. It is often found in slow-moving waters such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands."
