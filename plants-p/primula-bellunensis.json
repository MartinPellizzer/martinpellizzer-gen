    "intro": "Primula bellunensis, commonly known as the Belluno primrose, is a rare alpine plant native to the Dolomites in northern Italy. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded rock crevices at high altitudes, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are basal, with a broad, heart-shaped outline and a hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range."
