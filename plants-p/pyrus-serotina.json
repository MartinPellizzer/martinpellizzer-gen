    "intro": "Pyrus serotina, commonly known as the late pear, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves. The tree produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart pomes in late summer. Pyrus serotina is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, and it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife."
