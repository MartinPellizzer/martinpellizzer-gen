It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-yellow, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Phaenopyrum pruinosum is often found in disturbed areas and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
