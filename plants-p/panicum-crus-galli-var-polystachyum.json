    "intro": "Panicum crus-galli var. polystachyum, commonly known as red rice grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, red or brown seeds. The plant thrives in wet or disturbed soils and is often found in marshy areas or along waterways. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. The seeds are sometimes used as a minor food source or in traditional medicine."
