    "intro": "Pernettya prostrata var. myrsinoides, commonly known as the prostrate pernettya, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the cool, moist forests of eastern North America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. This variety is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover."
