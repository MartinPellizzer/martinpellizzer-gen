    "intro": "Platanthera limosa, commonly known as the pale yellow twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to wetlands and moist woodlands in North America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant is epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning it can grow on trees or rocks, often in shaded environments. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is essential for its survival. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
