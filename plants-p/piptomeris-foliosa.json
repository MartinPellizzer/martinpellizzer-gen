    "intro": "Piptomeris foliosa, commonly known as the broad-leaved pteris, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically deeply lobed or divided. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its unique leaf structure and reproductive features make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
