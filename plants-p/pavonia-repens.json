    "intro": "Pavonia repens, commonly known as the prostrate pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. The plant features slender stems that trail along the ground, producing clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. Its foliage is lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it blooms throughout the summer months. Pavonia repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils in coastal landscapes."
