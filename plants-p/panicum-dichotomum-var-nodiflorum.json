    "intro": "Panicum dichotomum var. nodiflorum, commonly known as clustered switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that often form in clusters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils. It is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to soil stabilization. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and ornamental gardening."
