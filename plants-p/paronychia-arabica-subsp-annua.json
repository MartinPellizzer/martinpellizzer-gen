    "intro": "Paronychia arabica subsp. annua, commonly known as the annual sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its spread in disturbed environments. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
