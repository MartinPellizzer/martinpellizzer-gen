    "intro": "Psychotria johnsonii, commonly known as Johnson's Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptic leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It produces berries that are typically red when mature, which are an important food source for various bird species. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
