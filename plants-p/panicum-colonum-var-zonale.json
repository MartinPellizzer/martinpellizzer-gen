    "intro": "Panicum colonum var. zonale, commonly known as the zonal panic grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive zonate leaf patterns, which feature alternating light and dark bands along the leaf blades. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value comes from its fine, silver-gray foliage and the production of fluffy, light brown seed heads in late summer. It is often used in landscape design for its aesthetic appeal and ability to tolerate a variety of environmental conditions."
