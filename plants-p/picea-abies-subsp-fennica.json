It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The cones of this subspecies are usually shorter and more compact compared to those of the typical Norway spruce. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in boreal and subarctic regions. The tree is valued for its timber and plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
