    "intro": "Phegopteris heterolepia, commonly known as the heterolepia fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its intricate fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments, with a distinctive appearance that includes both sterile and fertile fronds. The plant is native to regions in Asia, including parts of India, China, and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged in a unique pattern on the underside of the fronds. The heterolepia fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
