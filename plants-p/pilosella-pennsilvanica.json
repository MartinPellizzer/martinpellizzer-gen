    "intro": "Pilosella pennsilvanica, commonly known as the Pennsylvania goatherb, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, often glandular leaves. Its yellow flowers, typically arranged in a cluster, bloom in late spring to early summer. Pilosella pennsilvanica is often found in open woods, meadows, and disturbed sites, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators."
