    "intro": "Poa macedonica var. achtarovii, commonly known as the Achtarovii meadow grass, is a rare variant of the Macedonian meadow grass native to specific regions of the Balkans. It is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in grassy meadows and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow spike of small, two-ranked spikelets, which are often tinged with a pale blue or purple hue. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of interest in ecological and conservation studies."
