    "intro": "Pleurostima, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its unique, often ephemeral blooms that appear after rainfall. The plant typically has hairy, succulent leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, purple, or red. Pleurostima species are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in their thick stems and leaves. Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, they are often considered endangered or threatened in many areas."
