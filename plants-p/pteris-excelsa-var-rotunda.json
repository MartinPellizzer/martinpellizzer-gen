    "intro": "Pteris excelsa var. rotunda, commonly known as the round-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its round, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate pinnae that are closely spaced. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
