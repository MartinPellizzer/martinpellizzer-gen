    "intro": "Pilosella fallacina subsp. prantlii, commonly known as the Prantl's cat's-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Its subspecies status highlights its distinct morphological and ecological adaptations compared to other members of the Pilosella genus. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
