    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis egleri, commonly known as the white-lipped pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually elongated and covered in a fine, velvety texture, which helps in moisture retention. This orchid is prized by botanists and horticulturists for its unique floral structure and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
