    "intro": "Potentilla verna major, commonly known as early potentilla, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 15 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The species is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
