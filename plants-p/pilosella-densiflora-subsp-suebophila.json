    "intro": "Pilosella densiflora subsp. suebophila, commonly known as the Suebophila cat's-ear, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. It has a compact growth habit with a rosette of basal leaves and a short flowering stem. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
