    "intro": "Persicaria natans f. hartwrightii, commonly known as floating knotweed, is a variant of the water knotweed species. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant is characterized by its floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, pinkish-white flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the summer months. This form is notable for its distinct morphological differences from the typical species, including more compact growth and reduced leaf size."
