    "intro": "Pharochilum, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a genus of flowering plants native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers that open in the late afternoon and close at night. Pharochilum species are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. They have adapted to harsh conditions with deep root systems and succulent leaves that store water. The genus includes several species, such as Pharochilum ambiguum and Pharochilum hirsutum, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
