    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 titibuense, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Polystichum munitum and Polystichum milleflorum. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are often adorned with a silvery-white tomentum on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its aesthetic qualities."
