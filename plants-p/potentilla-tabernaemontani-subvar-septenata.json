    "intro": "Potentilla tabernaemontani subvar. septenata, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in well-drained, rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are finely divided and hairy, contributing to its adaptability to harsh alpine conditions. This subvariety is often used in rock gardens and as a hardy ornamental plant in colder climates."
