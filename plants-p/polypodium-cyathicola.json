    "intro": "Polypodium cyathicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium cyathicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
