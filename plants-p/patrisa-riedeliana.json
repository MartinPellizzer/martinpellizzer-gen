    "intro": "Patrisa riedeliana, commonly known as the Riedel's patrisia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
