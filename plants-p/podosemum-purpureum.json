It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its striking purple flowers and woody stems, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a rough texture that aids in water retention. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several seeds, facilitating its dispersal by wind or animals."
