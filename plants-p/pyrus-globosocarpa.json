    "intro": "Pyrus globosocarpa, commonly known as the globular crabapple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its small, round fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red or yellow when mature. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape. It produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the distinctive globular fruits. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
