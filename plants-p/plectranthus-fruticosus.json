    "intro": "Plectranthus fruticosus, commonly known as Cape verbena, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, woody stems and opposite leaves. The leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a glossy green surface and a slightly hairy texture. It produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or blue, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
