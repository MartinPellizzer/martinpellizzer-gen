    "intro": "Pedilonum inopinatum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. It thrives in high humidity and requires specific conditions to bloom, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Pedilonum inopinatum is considered critically endangered in many regions."
