    "intro": "Pavetta breviflora var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth pavetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring simple, opposite, and often lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. The species is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other varieties within the Pavetta genus."
