    "intro": "Panicum triquetrum, commonly known as three-cornered grass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as fields, roadsides, and waste grounds. Panicum triquetrum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
