It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often described as resembling a feather or a lace-like structure. This plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests, where it thrives on moist rock surfaces or tree trunks. Its small, intricate leaves are adapted for efficient water retention and photosynthesis in low-light conditions. Plesioneuron bipinnatum is often found in epiphytic or lithophytic habitats, showcasing its ability to grow on other plants or rocks without being parasitic."
