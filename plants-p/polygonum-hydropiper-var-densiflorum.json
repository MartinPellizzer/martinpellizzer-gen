    "intro": "Polygonum hydropiper var. densiflorum, commonly known as water pepper, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats. It features slender, upright stems covered with small, glandular dots that exude a peppery scent when crushed. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly rough texture. It is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
