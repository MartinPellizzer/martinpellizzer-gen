    "intro": "Phaius \u00d7 cooksonii, commonly known as the Cookson's ginger orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as swampy forests and along riverbanks. Its leaves are broad, strap-like, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
