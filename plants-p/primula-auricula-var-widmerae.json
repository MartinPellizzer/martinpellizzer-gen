    "intro": "Primula auricula var. widmerae, commonly known as the Widmer's auricula, is a rare and distinctive variant of the auricula primrose. It is characterized by its vibrant, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, with a distinctive ear-like projection on the petals. Native to the alpine regions of the European Alps, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its foliage consists of dark green, wrinkled leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and often endangered species in botanical collections."
