    "intro": "Potentilla maculata firma, commonly known as the spotted knapweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, slender stems covered in soft, grayish-green foliage with distinctive white or pale purple markings. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
