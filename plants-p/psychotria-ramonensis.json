It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Costa Rica and Panama. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often visited by various pollinators. The plant is also notable for containing alkaloids, though its chemical composition is less studied compared to other Psychotria species."
