It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to silver hair, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
