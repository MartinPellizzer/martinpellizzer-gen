    "intro": "Planchonella garcinioides, commonly known as the red mangrove or red mangosteen, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, sweet fruits that resemble mangosteen. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in mangrove forests, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
