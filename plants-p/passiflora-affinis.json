    "intro": "Passiflora affinis, commonly known as the yellow passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments around the reproductive structures. The plant produces edible, yellow-orange berries that are rich in nutrients and often consumed by both humans and animals. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough, textured surface, while its stems are woody and covered in fine, velvety hairs. Passiflora affinis is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant floral display and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
