    "intro": "Phreatia resiana, commonly known as the Resian nightshade, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant with fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic feature of many nightshade species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
