    "intro": "Pteracanthus mekongensis, commonly known as the Mekong water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Mekong River basin. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments with ample sunlight. Its reproductive structures are submerged, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Due to habitat degradation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
