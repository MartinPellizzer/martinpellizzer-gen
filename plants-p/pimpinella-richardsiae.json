    "intro": "Pimpinella richardsiae, commonly known as the Richards' cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or yellowish flowers that bloom in umbels. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range."
