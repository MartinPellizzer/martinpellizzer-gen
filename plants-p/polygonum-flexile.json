    "intro": "Polygonum flexile, commonly known as water smartweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features slender, branching stems that often trail along the ground or grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, pink to reddish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Polygonum flexile thrives in moist soils and is often found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and streambanks."
