    "intro": "Primula modesta var. samanimontana, commonly known as the Samanimontan primrose, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The leaves are typically oval and slightly hairy, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its alpine habitat. This variety is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized gardens. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
