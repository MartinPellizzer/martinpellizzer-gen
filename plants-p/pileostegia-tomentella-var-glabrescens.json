    "intro": "Pileostegia tomentella var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth pileostegia, is a shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy stems that become smoother with age. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are usually opposite and oval in shape, with a slightly waxy texture. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
