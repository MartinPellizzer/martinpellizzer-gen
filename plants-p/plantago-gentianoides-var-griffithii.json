It features lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variety is noted for its hardiness and adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
