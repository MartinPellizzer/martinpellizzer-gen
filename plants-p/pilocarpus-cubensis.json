    "intro": "Pilocarpus cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban pilocarpus, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba and Hispaniola. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for containing the alkaloid pilocarpine, which has been used in traditional medicine for its stimulant and anticholinergic properties. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and is often found in dry, coastal areas. Due to its unique chemical composition, it has attracted interest in both botanical research and herbal applications."
