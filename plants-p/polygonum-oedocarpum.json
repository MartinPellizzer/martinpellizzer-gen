    "intro": "Polygonum oedocarpum, commonly known as the broadleaf knotweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and can form dense colonies, often in moist or wet environments. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, dry, three-lobed fruits. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
