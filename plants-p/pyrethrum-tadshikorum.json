    "intro": "Pyrethrum tadshikorum, commonly known as the Tibetan pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers. The plant produces fine, hairy leaves and has a distinctive floral structure with multiple ray florets. Its botanical significance lies in its natural pyrethrin content, which makes it a valuable source for organic pesticides. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters."
