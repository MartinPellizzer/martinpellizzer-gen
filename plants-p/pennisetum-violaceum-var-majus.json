It features tall, upright clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that turn a vibrant purple hue in the fall. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish-white plumes that add visual interest throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for perennial borders and containers. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice in xeriscaping and landscape design."
