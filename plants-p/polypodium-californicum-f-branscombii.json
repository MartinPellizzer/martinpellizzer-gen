    "intro": "Polypodium californicum f. branscombii, commonly known as the Branscomb\u2019s maidenhair fern, is a rare and unique variant of the western maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slight reddish tint on the underside. This fern is native to the coastal regions of California, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
