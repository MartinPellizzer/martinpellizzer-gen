    "intro": "Pellaea pteroides, commonly known as the hooked spleenwort, is a fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of leathery, dark green leaves that are often curled at the tips. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Pellaea pteroides is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
