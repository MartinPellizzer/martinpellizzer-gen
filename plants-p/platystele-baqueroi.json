    "intro": "Platystele baqueroi, commonly known as the Baquer\u00f3's ghost plant, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular leaves and unique floral structure. The plant produces striking, white, star-shaped flowers that are highly specialized for pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for the health of its fragile ecosystem."
