    "intro": "Pteris involuta, commonly known as the curled fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, tightly curled fronds that unfurl as they mature. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Pteris involuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
