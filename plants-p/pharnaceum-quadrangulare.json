    "intro": "Pharnaceum quadrangulare, commonly known as the four-cornered pharnaceum, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its square-shaped stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
