    "intro": "Pseudophegopteris aubertii, commonly known as the Aubert's water fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the wetlands of southeastern China. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
