It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is often found in native habitats and coastal areas."
