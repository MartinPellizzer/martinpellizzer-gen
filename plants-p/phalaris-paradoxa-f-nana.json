    "intro": "Phalaris paradoxa f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf paradoxa grass, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance contribute to its horticultural appeal."
