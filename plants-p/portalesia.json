    "intro": "Portalesia, commonly known as the \"Mexican buttercup,\" is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy, often toxic species. The plant features showy, yellow flowers with five petals and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant grows up to 30 centimeters in height. However, it is considered toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of protoanemonin in its tissues."
