It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in mountainous regions with a preference for well-drained, calcareous soils. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape with a smooth margin. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, yellowish fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
