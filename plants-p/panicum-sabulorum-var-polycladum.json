    "intro": "Panicum sabulorum var. polycladum, commonly known as sand panicgrass, is a grass species native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments and coastal prairies. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a valuable plant for stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion."
