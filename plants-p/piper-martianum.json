    "intro": "Piper martianum, commonly known as the swamp pepper or water pepper, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes. Its fruits are small, three-lobed berries that contain several seeds. Piper martianum is notable for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
