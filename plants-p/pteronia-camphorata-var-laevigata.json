It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, aromatic leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, with thick, waxy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its medicinal properties have also been noted in traditional herbal practices."
