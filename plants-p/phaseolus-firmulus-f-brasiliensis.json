    "intro": "Phaseolus firmulus f. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian dwarf bean, is a compact, herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, narrow pods. The plant is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often grown as an ornamental or for its unique foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is relatively rare in cultivation."
