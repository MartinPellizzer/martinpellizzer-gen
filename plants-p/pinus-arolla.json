    "intro": "Pinus arolla, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a species of coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its serotinous cones, which remain closed until exposed to high temperatures, typically from a forest fire. The tree has a slow growth rate and can live for over 1,000 years, making it a long-lived species. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against wildfires and extreme weather conditions. The whitebark pine plays a vital role in its ecosystem, offering habitat and food for various wildlife species."
