    "intro": "Pandanus crassicollis, commonly known as the broad-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, paddle-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into fibrous, spiky fruits. Its leaves are fibrous and durable, making them valuable for weaving and basket-making. Pandanus crassicollis thrives in coastal and wetland areas, often growing in shallow water or on sandy soils."
