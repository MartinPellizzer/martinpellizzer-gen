    "intro": "Phacelia monosperma, commonly known as the single-seeded phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, and it produces a single seed per flower, which is a distinguishing feature. Phacelia monosperma is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas."
