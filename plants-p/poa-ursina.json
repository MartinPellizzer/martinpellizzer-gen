    "intro": "Poa ursina, commonly known as the bear's grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the northern hemisphere and thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically green or reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a dense growth habit that helps it compete successfully in shaded areas. Poa ursina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
