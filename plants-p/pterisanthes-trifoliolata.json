It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling dandelion blooms. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. Pterisanthes trifoliolata is adapted to the arid and coastal environments of its native habitat."
