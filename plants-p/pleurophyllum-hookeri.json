    "intro": "Pleurophyllum hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's pleurophyllum, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is known for its striking blue or purple flowers. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and birds. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
