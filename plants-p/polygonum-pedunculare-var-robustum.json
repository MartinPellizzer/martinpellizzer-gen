    "intro": "Polygonum pedunculare var. robustum, commonly known as the red polygonum or Japanese knotweed, is a vigorous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features stout, reddish stems that often have a woody texture as it matures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on elongated peduncles. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a distinctive reddish or purplish tinge, especially on the underside. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
