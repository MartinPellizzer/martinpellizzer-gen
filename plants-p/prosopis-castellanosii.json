    "intro": "Prosopis castellanosii, commonly known as the Castellanos mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually reduced to spines in mature plants, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, hard pods that contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife and humans. It is well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
