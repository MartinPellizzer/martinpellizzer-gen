    "intro": "Pendulluma, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical plant characterized by its drooping branches and glossy, dark green leaves. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is native to parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant's unique appearance is due to its pendulous growth habit, which gives it a cascading, ornamental look. Pendulluma is often cultivated as a houseplant or in outdoor gardens for its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities. However, it can be toxic to pets if ingested, making it important to handle with care."
