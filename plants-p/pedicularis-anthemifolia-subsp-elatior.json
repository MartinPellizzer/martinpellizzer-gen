    "intro": "Pedicularis anthemifolia subsp. elatior, commonly known as the greater yellow monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble those of the genus *Orchis*, with a distinctive spurred petal. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in many parts of its range."
