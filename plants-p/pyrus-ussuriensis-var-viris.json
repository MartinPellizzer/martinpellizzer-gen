    "intro": "Pyrus ussuriensis var. viris, commonly known as the Ussuri pear, is a variant of the Ussuri pear native to eastern Asia. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in forested areas and along riverbanks. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are edible but not as widely cultivated as other pear varieties. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while its flowers are white and appear in clusters. The plant has a relatively short lifespan and is often found in moist, temperate climates."
