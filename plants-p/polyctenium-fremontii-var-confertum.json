    "intro": "Polyctenium fremontii var. confertum, commonly known as the Fremont's feather grass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and dense, feathery inflorescences that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight sheen, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
