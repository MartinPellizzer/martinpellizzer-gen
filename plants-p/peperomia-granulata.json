It features glossy, ovate leaves with a distinctive granular texture and a deep green coloration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red, followed by winged seeds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its compact size and unique foliage, it is often used as a decorative plant in shaded or low-light environments."
