    "intro": "Pneumatopteris glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth frond fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that are typically glabrous, or smooth, with a pale green to yellowish coloration. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its role in the ecological cycle of its habitat."
