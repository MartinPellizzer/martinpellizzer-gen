    "intro": "Perissocarpa, commonly known as the \"odd-fruited\" plant, is a term used to describe fruits that have an odd number of seeds or a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, usually fleshy, pericarp. These fruits are typically found in certain species of flowering plants, particularly within the Rutaceae family. The pericarp, or fruit wall, may be fleshy or dry, depending on the specific plant species. Perissocarps are often adapted for animal dispersal, with their structure facilitating attachment to fur or feathers. This botanical feature plays a crucial role in the plant's reproductive strategy and ecological interactions."
