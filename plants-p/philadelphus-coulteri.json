It features fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along the stems. The plant has compound leaves with ovate to lanceolate leaflets and produces small, red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to xeriscaped gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its showy blooms and pleasant fragrance."
