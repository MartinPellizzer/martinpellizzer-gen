    "intro": "Physalis incana, commonly known as the wooly nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that develop into inflated, lantern-like fruits. These fruits, which are typically orange to red in color, contain numerous seeds. Physalis incana thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils."
