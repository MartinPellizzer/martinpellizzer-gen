It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well-known for its resin, mastic, which has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and as a chewing gum. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. The leaves are leathery and dark green, contributing to its ornamental value in landscaping."
