    "intro": "Pyrus loriformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are similar to pears. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and fruit production, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
