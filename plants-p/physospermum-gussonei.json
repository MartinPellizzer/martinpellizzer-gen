    "intro": "Physospermum gussonei, commonly known as the Gussone's physospermum, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are erect and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
