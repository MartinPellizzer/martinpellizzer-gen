    "intro": "Pteris hondurensis, commonly known as the Honduras water fern, is a species of fern native to Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green and often have a waxy coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pteris hondurensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
