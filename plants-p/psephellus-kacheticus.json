    "intro": "Psephellus kacheticus, commonly known as the Kacheticus psephellus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and somewhat woody. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
