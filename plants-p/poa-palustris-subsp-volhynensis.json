    "intro": "Poa palustris subsp. volhynensis, commonly known as the Volhynian marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often hairy leaves that are adapted to waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with bisexual flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in peat bogs and other moist environments, playing a vital role in stabilizing these fragile ecosystems. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
