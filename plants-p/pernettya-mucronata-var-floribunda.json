    "intro": "Pernettya mucronata var. floribunda, commonly known as the pink wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique flowering period."
