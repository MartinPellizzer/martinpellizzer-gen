    "intro": "Polypodium drymoglossoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial evergreen fern that typically grows on rocky substrates, cliffs, and tree trunks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark green, leathery fronds that are pinnately compound. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium drymoglossoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments."
