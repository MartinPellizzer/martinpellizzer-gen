    "intro": "Populus rotundifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 3\u20136 inches in diameter and have a smooth, waxy surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by spherical, fuzzy seed capsules. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured and flaky with age. Populus rotundifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils near streams and rivers, and it plays an important role in riparian ecosystems."
