    "intro": "Plantago coronopus f. tenuis, commonly known as narrow-leaved plantain, is a variant of the common plantain, characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist meadows, riverbanks, and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a slightly bitter taste, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. This variant is closely related to other Plantago species and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
