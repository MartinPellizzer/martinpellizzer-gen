    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris var. pedemontana, commonly known as the Montane milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellowish-green to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
