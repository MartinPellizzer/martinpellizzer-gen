It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, upright stem and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single, greenish-brown flower with a distinctive hood-like structure, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The species is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on certain flies for reproduction."
