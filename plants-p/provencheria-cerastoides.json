    "intro": "Provencheria cerastoides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Provencheria cerastoides is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
