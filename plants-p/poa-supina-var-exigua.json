    "intro": "Poa supina var. exigua, commonly known as the dwarf bentgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, creeping stems that produce small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and covered with a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its dense, carpet-like appearance."
