    "intro": "Psorospermum campestre, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of southern Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom during the dry season, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and sometimes branched. Psorospermum campestre is adapted to saline and arid conditions, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
