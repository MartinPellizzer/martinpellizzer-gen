    "intro": "Phelline wagapensis var. gracilior, commonly known as the slender phelline, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
