    "intro": "Pneumatopteris rotumaensis, commonly known as the Rotuma fern, is a rare fern species native to the island of Rotuma in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in coastal or lowland forest areas. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
