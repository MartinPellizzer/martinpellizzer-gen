    "intro": "Pappostipa ameghinoi var. precordillerana, commonly known as the Andean grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of the Andean foothills. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often covered in fine hairs. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations in its native habitat."
