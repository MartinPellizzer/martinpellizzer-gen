These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and sandy environments. They are characterized by their striking, often blue or purple, flowers that resemble holly berries. Posadaea species are usually perennial herbs with narrow, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. Their ecological importance includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
