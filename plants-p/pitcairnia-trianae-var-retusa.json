    "intro": "Pitcairnia trianae var. retusa, commonly known as the Rosette Pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with bright red flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among bromeliad enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
