    "intro": "Pteris doniana, commonly known as the African water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Pteris doniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
