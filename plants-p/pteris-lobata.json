    "intro": "Pteris lobata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pteris lobata is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
