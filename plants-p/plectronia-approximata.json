    "intro": "Plectronia approximata, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its small, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique growth habit, often growing as a low shrub with slender, hairy stems. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Plectronia approximata is considered a conservation concern."
