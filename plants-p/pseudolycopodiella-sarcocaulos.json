It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and stream banks. The plant has slender, wiry stems that are often reddish in color and bear small, scale-like leaves. Its sporophylls are arranged in dense clusters and produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia. This plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
