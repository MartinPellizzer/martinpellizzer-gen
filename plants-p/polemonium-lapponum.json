    "intro": "Polemonium lapponum, commonly known as the Lapland bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features upright, slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are lanceolate and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold climates. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in open habitats such as tundra and rocky slopes. The plant is noted for its early spring blooming period, making it an important nectar source for pollinators."
