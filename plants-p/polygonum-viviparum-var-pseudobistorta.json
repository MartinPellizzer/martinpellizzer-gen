It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or reddish, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and roadside areas."
