    "intro": "Primula decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with hairy stems and oval, heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats. Its unique floral structure and deceptive appearance have made it a subject of interest in both botanical studies and horticulture."
