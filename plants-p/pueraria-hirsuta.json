    "intro": "Pueraria hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy pueraria, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of purple or white flowers. The plant produces cylindrical, woody pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable forage crop and an invasive weed in some regions."
