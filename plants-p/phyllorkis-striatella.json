It belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae and is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which is essential for its survival and growth. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Its morphology and ecological role make it an important indicator species for environmental conditions."
