    "intro": "Peliostomum viscosum, commonly known as the sticky pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, flexible stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often coated with a sticky substance. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that are typically found in clusters near the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Due to its ability to spread rapidly, it can become invasive in certain aquatic ecosystems."
