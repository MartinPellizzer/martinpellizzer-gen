    "intro": "Phegopteris decursive-pinnata f. truncata, commonly known as the truncated cliff brake, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive frond morphology. It features bi- or tri-pinnate leaves with a truncate or rounded apex, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. This fern is part of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to regions in the eastern United States and parts of Canada."
