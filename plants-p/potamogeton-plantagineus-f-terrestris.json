    "intro": "Potamogeton plantagineus f. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments. It has long, thin, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or just at the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving waters with muddy or sandy bottoms. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic life."
