    "intro": "Polypodium milnei, commonly known as the Milne's water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often borne on long, creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are dispersed through the air, and the fronds can be either sterile or reproductive, depending on the stage of growth. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor environments."
