    "intro": "Polystichum preslianum, commonly known as the Presle's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by indusia. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum preslianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
