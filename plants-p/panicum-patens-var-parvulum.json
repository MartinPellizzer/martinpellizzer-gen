    "intro": "Panicum patens var. parvulum, commonly known as dwarf bottlebrush grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that produce dense clusters of small, red to purple spikelets, resembling bottlebrushes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained sandy or loamy soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, drought-tolerant ground cover."
