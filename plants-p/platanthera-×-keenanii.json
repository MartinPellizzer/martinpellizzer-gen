    "intro": "Platanthera \u00d7 keenanii, commonly known as the Keenan's twayblade, is a hybrid orchid native to the eastern United States. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that bears two opposite leaves near the base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically pollinated by flies and beetles. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
