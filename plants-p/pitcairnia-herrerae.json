    "intro": "Pitcairnia herrerae, commonly known as the Herrera's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturalists alike."
