    "intro": "Polystichum tijucense, commonly known as the Tijuca fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its feathery, dark green fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies. Polystichum tijucense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
