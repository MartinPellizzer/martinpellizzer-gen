    "intro": "Pelea haupuensis, commonly known as the H\u0101p\u016bp\u016b tree, is a native Hawaiian plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Pelea haupuensis is adapted to the moist, shaded environments of Hawaiian rainforests and is often found in mesic to wet forest habitats. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
