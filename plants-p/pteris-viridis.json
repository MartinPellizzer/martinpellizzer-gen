    "intro": "Pteris viridis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, finger-like segments. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are housed in clusters called sori. Pteris viridis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in the undergrowth of forests. Its simple yet elegant appearance makes it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and indoor plant collections."
