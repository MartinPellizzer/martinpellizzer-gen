    "intro": "Pteris ensiformis var. rheophila, commonly known as the water fern or river fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams and in humid forests. The plant has pinnately divided fronds with a distinctive, narrow, sword-like shape, which gives it its common name. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across wetland areas. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, making it well adapted to its moist habitat."
