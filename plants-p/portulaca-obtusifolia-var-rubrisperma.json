    "intro": "Portulaca obtusifolia var. rubrisperma, commonly known as Crimson Portulaca, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are typically rounded and thick. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom throughout the summer months. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant and well adapted to arid environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is popular in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
