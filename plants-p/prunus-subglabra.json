    "intro": "Prunus subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-chinned cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically 2-6 inches long. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, red or black drupes. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade. Prunus subglabra is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife."
