    "intro": "Potentilla cinerea subsp. tommasiniana, commonly known as the gray cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, typically from June to August. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
