    "intro": "Polypodium spinulosum, commonly known as the spinulose holly fern, is a species of polypody fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, spiny projections along the leaflets. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its unique morphology and ecological role. The spines on its fronds are a distinguishing feature that aids in identification."
