    "intro": "Polystachya heckeliana, commonly known as the Heckel's spikegrass, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and often covered with a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from green to purple, depending on the species."
