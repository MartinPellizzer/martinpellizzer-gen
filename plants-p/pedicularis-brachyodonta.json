    "intro": "Pedicularis brachyodonta, commonly known as the short-fruit lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its spurred flowers, which are typically pink or purple in color, and its hairy, glandular stems. It grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often in association with other plants in open, sunny environments. Its morphology reflects adaptations to nutrient-poor soils, with specialized root structures that allow it to absorb nutrients from host plants."
