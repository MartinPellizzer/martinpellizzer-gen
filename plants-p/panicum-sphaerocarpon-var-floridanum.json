    "intro": "Panicum sphaerocarpon var. floridanum, commonly known as Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clump-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers, which are often clustered in dense, spherical heads. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. This variety is often used in native plant gardens and for erosion control due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
