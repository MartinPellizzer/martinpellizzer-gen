    "intro": "Pinus obovata, commonly known as the Japanese black pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in clusters of five. The tree produces small, oval cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value. Pinus obovata is also valued for its resilience to coastal conditions and its ability to grow in rocky or sandy environments."
