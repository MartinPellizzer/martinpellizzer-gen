    "intro": "Pterostylis crypta, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is a small, leafless plant that produces a single, pale green to brownish flower with a distinctive pouch-like structure. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, as it lacks true leaves. Its habitat is typically in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes."
