    "intro": "Prenanthes ovata, commonly known as the roundleaf water-campion, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, showcasing its adaptability to moist environments. The plant features basal leaves that are ovate to rounded in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, white or pale blue flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, blooming from late summer to early fall. Prenanthes ovata plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in areas with rich, organic soil."
