    "intro": "Plantago maritima var. integralis, commonly known as sea plantain, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. It is often found growing along shorelines, dunes, and other coastal habitats. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion."
