    "intro": "Primula boreiocalliantha, commonly known as the northern primrose, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of eastern Siberia and northern China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
