    "intro": "Phacelia peckii, commonly known as Peck's phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its small, ovate leaves are arranged oppositely along the stem, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Phacelia peckii is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
