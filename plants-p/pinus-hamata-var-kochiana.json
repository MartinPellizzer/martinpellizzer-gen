    "intro": "Pinus hamata var. kochiana, commonly known as the Koch's pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The cones of this variety are relatively small and usually mature in the second year, releasing their seeds in the fall. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, humid climate for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
