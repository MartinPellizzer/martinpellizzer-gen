    "intro": "Platanthera fujianensis, commonly known as the Fujian lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to China. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and a dense cluster of pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in mountainous regions. Its flowers emit a faint fragrance, which helps attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species."
