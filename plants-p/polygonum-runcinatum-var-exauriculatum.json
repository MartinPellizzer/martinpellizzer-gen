    "intro": "Polygonum runcinatum var. exauriculatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and have a reddish tint along the margins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, ditches, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions."
