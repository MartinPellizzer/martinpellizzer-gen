    "intro": "Pseudocladia neblinaensis, commonly known as the misty pseudocladia, is a unique plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cavity, typical of bromeliads. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help to retain moisture in the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Due to its restricted distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
