    "intro": "Polystichum spinulosum subsp. aemulum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely serrated margin. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, brown indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
