    "intro": "Polypodium membranaceum, commonly known as the membranous holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, membranous texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
