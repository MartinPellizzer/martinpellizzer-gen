    "intro": "Psychotria tenuifolia, commonly known as the \"arrow poison plant,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It contains toxic alkaloids, including tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which have been historically used by indigenous peoples for ritual and medicinal purposes. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is also of interest in ethnobotanical and pharmacological research."
