    "intro": "Platythelys pachysepala, commonly known as the thick-sepal orchid, is a unique species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, fleshy sepals that are often brightly colored, which serve to attract pollinators. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of rainforests. Its flowers are usually clustered in inflorescences and bloom during the wet season. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
