    "intro": "Polystichum montevidense var. nudicaule, commonly known as the naked-stalk sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern genus native to South America. It is characterized by its upright, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, narrow shape. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is notable for its reduced stipe, giving it a more compact and elegant appearance compared to other polystichum species."
