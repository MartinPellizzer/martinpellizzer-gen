    "intro": "Pultenaea euchila, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features slender, often sparsely hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge. Its small yellow flowers appear in late winter to early spring, forming dense spikes that attract various pollinators. Pultenaea euchila is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands."
