    "intro": "Polypodium preslianum var. immersum, commonly known as the submerged fern, is a rare and aquatic variant of the polypody fern. It thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in shaded, still waters such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant's fronds are typically submerged, with a dark green coloration and a delicate, feathery appearance. It reproduces through spores, which are released into the water and germinate into new plants. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often found in isolated or protected ecosystems."
