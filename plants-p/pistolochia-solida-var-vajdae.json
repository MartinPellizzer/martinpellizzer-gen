    "intro": "Pistolochia solida var. vajdae, commonly known as the hardy cat's claw, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can tolerate periods of drought. Its unique morphology and resilience make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
