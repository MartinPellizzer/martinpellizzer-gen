    "intro": "Polygonum debilius, commonly known as weak knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. The plant features slender stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences and produce tiny, three-lobed seeds. Polygonum debilius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
