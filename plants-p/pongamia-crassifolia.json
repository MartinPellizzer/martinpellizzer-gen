It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, woody pods containing seeds that are often used for oil extraction. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is adapted to poor soil conditions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
