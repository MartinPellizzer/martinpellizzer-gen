    "intro": "Panicum lolium, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Panicum lolium is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
