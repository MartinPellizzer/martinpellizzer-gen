    "intro": "Passerina uniflora var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, typically in shades of pink or purple, during the early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
