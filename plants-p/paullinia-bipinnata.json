    "intro": "Paullinia bipinnata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a member of the Sapindaceae family. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Brazil and Paraguay. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are twice-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically yellowish-green, and it produces orange-red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. The plant is often found in moist, tropical environments and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
