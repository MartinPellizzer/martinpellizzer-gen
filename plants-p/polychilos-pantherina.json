    "intro": "Polychilos pantherina, commonly known as the pantherina orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, dark green leaves and its highly ornate, fragrant flowers that resemble the patterns of a panther's skin. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers, which bloom in clusters, are noted for their complex structure and vibrant coloration, often featuring a mix of purple, yellow, and white. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Polychilos pantherina is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
