It is characterized by its distinctive drooping branches that give it a cascading appearance. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces cone-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This ornamental tree is valued for its unique form and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
