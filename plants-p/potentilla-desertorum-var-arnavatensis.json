    "intro": "Potentilla desertorum var. arnavatensis, commonly known as the Navajo potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters, characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping and rocky garden settings. The Navajo potentilla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
