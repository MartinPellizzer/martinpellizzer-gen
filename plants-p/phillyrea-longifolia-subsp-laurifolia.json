    "intro": "Phillyrea longifolia subsp. laurifolia, commonly known as the laurel Phillyrea, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, leathery leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, often with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or coastal environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader leaves and more compact growth compared to other Phillyrea species."
