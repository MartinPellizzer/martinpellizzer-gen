    "intro": "Populus balsamifera var. pilosa, commonly known as the silky poplar or balsam poplar, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves with a soft, downy texture. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common species in riparian zones."
