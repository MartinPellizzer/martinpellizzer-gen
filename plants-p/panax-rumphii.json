    "intro": "Panax rumphii, commonly known as the Java ginseng, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in its natural range."
