    "intro": "Pseudotsuga mucronata var. palustris, commonly known as the swamp hemlock, is a variant of the hemlock tree adapted to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and dark green, needle-like foliage. The leaves are typically shorter and more pointed compared to other hemlock species, and they often retain their color year-round. This variety thrives in poorly drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and bogs. Its ecological role includes providing habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to soil stabilization in moist environments."
