    "intro": "Poa arctica var. stricta, commonly known as Arctic hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in harsh conditions. This variety is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and prolonged periods of frost."
