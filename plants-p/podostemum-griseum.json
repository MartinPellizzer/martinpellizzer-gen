It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant typically grows in shallow, fast-flowing streams and rivers, where it attaches itself to rocks or other substrates. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in the summer months. Podostemum griseum plays an important ecological role in its environment, providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
