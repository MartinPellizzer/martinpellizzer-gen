    "intro": "Pteris recurvata var. wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish spores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
