    "intro": "Pterocephalus wendelboi, commonly known as Wendelbo's goatweed, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is typically herbaceous, with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in a cluster, which are adapted for efficient pollination in its high-altitude environment. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species with limited distribution."
