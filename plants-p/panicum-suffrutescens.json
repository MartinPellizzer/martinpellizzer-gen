    "intro": "Panicum suffrutescens, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters and has slender, wiry stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, red or brown spikelets that are often used in floral arrangements. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray coloration that helps reduce water loss. Panicum suffrutescens is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common ornamental and landscape plant."
