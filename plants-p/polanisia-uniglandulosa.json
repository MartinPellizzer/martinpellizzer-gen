It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has simple, alternate leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
