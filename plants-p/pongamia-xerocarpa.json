    "intro": "Pongamia xerocarpa, commonly known as the desert pongam, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of India and Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and pod-like fruits. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Its leaves are often small and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. The seeds of Pongamia xerocarpa are encased in a hard, woody pod and are dispersed by wind or animals."
