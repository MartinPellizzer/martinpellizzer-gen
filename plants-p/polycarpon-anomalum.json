It is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures used for trapping microscopic organisms. The plant is native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still waters and has small, opposite leaves. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, and it relies on water for dispersal of its seeds."
