    "intro": "Potentilla hypoleuca, commonly known as the white potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants. The species is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small insects."
