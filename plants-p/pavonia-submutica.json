    "intro": "Pavonia submutica, commonly known as the rough pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and woodland edges. The plant features upright, branched stems covered with stiff, rough hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its showy, pink to red flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface and serrated edges, contributing to its rugged, wild aesthetic."
