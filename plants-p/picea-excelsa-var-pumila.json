    "intro": "Picea excelsa var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf white spruce, is a compact evergreen conifer native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its short, slow-growing shoots and dense, pyramidal crown. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are blue-green in color, often covered with a whitish bloom, giving it a silvery appearance. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds dispersed by wind. This variety is well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in cooler climates."
