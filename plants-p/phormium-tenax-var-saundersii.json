    "intro": "Phormium tenax var. saundersii, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a striking ornamental plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green or blue-gray in color. The plant produces striking purple or red flower spikes in the summer months, which are followed by distinctive, fibrous seed heads. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil. Due to its hardiness and visual appeal, it is widely cultivated in gardens and for its fibrous material used in traditional crafts."
