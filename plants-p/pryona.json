    "intro": "Pryona, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, white, orchid-like flowers and its ability to thrive without soil, growing epiphytically on trees. The plant has long, thin roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, making it highly adapted to its specific habitat. It is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and environmental changes. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and its status as a symbol of biodiversity in threatened ecosystems."
