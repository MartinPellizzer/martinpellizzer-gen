    "intro": "Piper alpinum, commonly known as the Andean pepper or mountain pepper, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, reaching up to 4,000 meters above sea level. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic properties. The fruit, which resembles a peppercorn, is used in both culinary and medicinal applications. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in cooler, mountainous climates."
