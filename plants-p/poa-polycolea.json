    "intro": "Poa polycolea, commonly known as the tufted meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters in width. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is commonly found in grasslands and wet meadows. Poa polycolea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
