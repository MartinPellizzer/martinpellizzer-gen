    "intro": "Puccinellia cusickii, commonly known as the Sierra grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Puccinellia cusickii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
