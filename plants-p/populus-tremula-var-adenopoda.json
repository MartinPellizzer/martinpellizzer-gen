    "intro": "Populus tremula var. adenopoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaf trembling poplar, is a variant of the trembling aspen found primarily in northern regions. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are essential for wind pollination. This variant is known for its resilience and ability to colonize disturbed areas, contributing to forest regeneration."
