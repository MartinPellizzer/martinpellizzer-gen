    "intro": "Poa glauca subsp. kitadakensis, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh alpine environments. The plant typically forms compact tufts with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to violet flowers, which are adapted for pollination by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
