    "intro": "Polemonium pauciflorum subsp. pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered bluebell, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators. The subspecies is characterized by its reduced flower count compared to other Polemonium species."
