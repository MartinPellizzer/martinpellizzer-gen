    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. scopulinum, commonly known as the scaly wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that are often covered with small, scaly structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
