    "intro": "Prunus xerocarpa, commonly known as the desert plum, is a small shrub or tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits that are adapted to survive in harsh environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Prunus xerocarpa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife in desert ecosystems."
