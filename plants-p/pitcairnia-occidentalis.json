    "intro": "Pitcairnia occidentalis, commonly known as the Western pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
