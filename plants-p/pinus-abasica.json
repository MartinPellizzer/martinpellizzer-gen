    "intro": "Pinus abasica, commonly known as the Abasica pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces cones that are woody and often remain attached to the branches for several years. It thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates, making it a resilient species in high-altitude environments. The Abasica pine plays a significant role in its native ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
