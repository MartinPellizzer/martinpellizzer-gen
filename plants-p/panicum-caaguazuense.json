    "intro": "Panicum caaguazuense, commonly known as the Caaguaz\u00fa grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in Paraguay and Argentina. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and floodplains, and is adapted to seasonal flooding. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often hairy and arranged in a panicle structure. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
