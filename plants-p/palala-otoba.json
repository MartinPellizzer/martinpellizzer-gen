    "intro": "Palala otoba, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with smooth, reddish-brown bark and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by red, fleshy berries that contain several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Palala otoba is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
