    "intro": "Panax calvum, commonly known as the smooth ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, unbranched root system and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Due to its medicinal properties and declining population, Panax calvum is highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserve this species in its natural habitat."
