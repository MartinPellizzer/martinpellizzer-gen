It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with prominent white veins and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It often grows in shaded, humid environments within rainforests. Psychotria lepidocalyx is also noted for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
