    "intro": "Panisea parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered panisea, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in the spring. Panisea parviflora is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
