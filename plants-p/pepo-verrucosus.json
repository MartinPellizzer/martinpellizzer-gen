It is characterized by its distinctive, rough, and often spiny exterior, which provides protection against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its fruit is a type of berry, known as a pepo, which is typically oval or elongated in shape. The plant is often found in dry, disturbed habitats and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
