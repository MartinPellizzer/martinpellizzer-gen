    "intro": "Polypodium subandinum, commonly known as the Andean shield fern, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky habitats. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to persist through seasonal changes. Polypodium subandinum plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
