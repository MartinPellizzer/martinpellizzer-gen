    "intro": "Pentacalia tarapotensis, commonly known as the Andean star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, elongated berries that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
