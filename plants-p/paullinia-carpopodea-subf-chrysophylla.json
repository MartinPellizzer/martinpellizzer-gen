It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts with its dark green stems and twigs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release seeds, a common reproductive strategy in the genus. This species is native to the tropical rainforests of South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
