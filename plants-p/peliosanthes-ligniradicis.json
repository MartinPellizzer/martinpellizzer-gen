    "intro": "Peliosanthes ligniradicis, commonly known as the black-root cycad, is a unique plant species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dark, woody roots that give it its scientific name. The plant has a stout, unbranched stem that supports a crown of pinnate leaves. Its reproductive structures include large, showy cones that are typical of cycads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
