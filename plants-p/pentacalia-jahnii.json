It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous regions. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds.
