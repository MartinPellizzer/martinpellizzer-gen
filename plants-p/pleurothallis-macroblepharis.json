    "intro": "Pleurothallis macroblepharis, commonly known as the large-eyed pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, epiphytic growth habit and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, enlarged lip that gives it its common name. Its leaves are usually dark green and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is a subject of interest for both botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
