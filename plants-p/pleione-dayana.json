    "intro": "Pleione dayana, commonly known as the Yunnan pleione, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is a herbaceous plant with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its high-altitude, cool climate. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a white or pale pink tepron and a distinctive, hooded lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and beauty, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
