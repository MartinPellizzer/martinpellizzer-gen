    "intro": "Poa alpina var. obtusata, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to alpine and subalpine regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its resilience and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine displays."
