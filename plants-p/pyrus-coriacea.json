    "intro": "Pyrus coriacea, commonly known as the sand pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like leaves that are thick and leathery, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible pears that are typically harvested in the fall. Pyrus coriacea is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for cultivation in dry climates. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
