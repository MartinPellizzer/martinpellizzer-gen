    "intro": "Populus tremuloides var. vancouveriana, commonly known as the Vancouver trembling aspen, is a variant of the trembling aspen native to western North America. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and heart-shaped leaves that tremble in the wind. The bark is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age, while the leaves are typically smaller and more finely toothed than those of the standard trembling aspen. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along mountain slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing streambanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
