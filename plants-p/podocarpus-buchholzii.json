    "intro": "Podocarpus buchholzii, commonly known as the dwarf podocarp, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Southeast Asia. It has lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its dense foliage and compact growth habit."
