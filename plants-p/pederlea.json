    "intro": "Pederlea, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are bi-lobed and remain green throughout the year, providing year-round foliage. Pederlea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
