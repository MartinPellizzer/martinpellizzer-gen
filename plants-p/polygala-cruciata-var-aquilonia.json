    "intro": "Polygala cruciata var. aquilonia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has adapted to arid environments through its deep root system. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that reduce water loss, and it produces yellow or greenish flowers that attract pollinators. This variety is often found in open grasslands and shrublands, contributing to the biodiversity of its native range."
