It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed structure that splits open to release tiny seeds.
