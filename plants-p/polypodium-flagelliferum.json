    "intro": "Polypodium flagelliferum, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often prostrate growth habit. The plant features fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments, with a distinctive, almost flagellate appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
