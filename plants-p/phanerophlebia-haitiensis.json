    "intro": "Phanerophlebia haitiensis, commonly known as the Haitian phanerophlebia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Haiti. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in areas with moderate to high humidity. Its leaves are simple and alternate, often with a hairy texture, while its flowers range in color from white to pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
