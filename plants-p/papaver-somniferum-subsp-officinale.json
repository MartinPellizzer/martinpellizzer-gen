    "intro": "Papaver somniferum subsp. officinale, commonly known as the opium poppy, is a flowering plant native to the region spanning the eastern Mediterranean to central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, rose-like flowers and capsule-shaped seed pods that contain latex-rich cells. The plant's botanical features include smooth, dark green leaves with a slightly lobed appearance and a sturdy, upright stem. The latex extracted from its immature seed pods is the source of opium and its derivatives, such as morphine and codeine. This subspecies is cultivated for both medicinal and illicit purposes due to its chemical composition."
