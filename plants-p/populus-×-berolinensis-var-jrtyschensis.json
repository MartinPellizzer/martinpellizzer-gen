    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 berolinensis var. jrtyschensis, commonly known as the Jrtyschene poplar, is a hybrid species native to Central Europe. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in riparian habitats."
