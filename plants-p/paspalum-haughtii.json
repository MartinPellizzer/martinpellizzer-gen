    "intro": "Paspalum haughtii, commonly known as the Florida grass or tall paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height. This plant is often found in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Paspalum haughtii is adapted to wet conditions and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
