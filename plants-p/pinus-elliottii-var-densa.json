    "intro": "Pinus elliottii var. densa, commonly known as the pond pine, is a variant of the slash pine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense foliage and shorter, more compact form compared to the typical slash pine. The leaves are usually shorter and more clustered, giving the tree a bushier appearance. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in swamps and along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its adaptability to moist soils and its role in ecological restoration projects."
