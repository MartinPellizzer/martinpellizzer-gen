    "intro": "Pitcairnia ramosii, commonly known as the branched pitcairnia, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for hydration. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with showy, often red or orange flowers that attract pollinators. Its foliage is typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Pitcairnia ramosii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique botanical features."
