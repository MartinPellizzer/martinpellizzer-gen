    "intro": "Pteracanthus rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leafed pteracanthus, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Pteracanthaceae. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, and it is known for its unique reproductive structures. It is primarily found in specific regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
