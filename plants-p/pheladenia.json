    "intro": "Pheladenia, commonly known as the false ivy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It consists of several species that are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. The plants typically have opposite, simple leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate. They produce showy, tubular flowers that are usually blue, purple, or white, which attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Pheladenia species are often grown as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and flowering habits."
