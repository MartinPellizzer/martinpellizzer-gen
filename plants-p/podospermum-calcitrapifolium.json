    "intro": "Podospermum calcitrapifolium, commonly known as the rock-trapleaf podo, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Podospermum calcitrapifolium is often found growing on rocky outcrops and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
