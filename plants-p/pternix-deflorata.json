    "intro": "Pternix deflorata, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its vibrant red-orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its dramatic visual appeal."
