    "intro": "Polystichum yoshinagae, commonly known as the Yoshinaga's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically lance-shaped and have a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces spore-bearing fiddleheads, which are curled and tightly wrapped, typical of many fern species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
