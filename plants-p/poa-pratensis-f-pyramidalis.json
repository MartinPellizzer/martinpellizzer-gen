It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to form a compact, upright mound. The plant typically produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive pyramidal shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Its fine-textured blades and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for garden beds and lawns."
