    "intro": "Protium tacamahaca, commonly known as the copal tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, simple leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Protium tacamahaca is valued for its aromatic resin, which has been used traditionally for incense and medicinal purposes."
