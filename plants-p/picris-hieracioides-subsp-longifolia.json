It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by elongated, bristly seed heads.
