    "intro": "Penstemon desertipicti, commonly known as the desert paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Penstemon desertipicti is also notable for its role in supporting local pollinators, particularly hummingbirds and bees."
