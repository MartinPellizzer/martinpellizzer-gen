    "intro": "Papaver maritimum, commonly known as sea poppy, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, papery petals that range in color from pale yellow to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, thriving in saline and well-drained environments. Its flowers bloom in early summer, and the plant is known for its ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions. The seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing the species to colonize new areas along the coast."
