    "intro": "Pelargonium betulinum, commonly known as the birchleaf geranium, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that resemble the leaves of the birch tree, hence its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Pelargonium betulinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
