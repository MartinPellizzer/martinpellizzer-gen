    "intro": "Phleum michelii subsp. ambiguum, commonly known as the ambiguous meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, often forming dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical structure is characterized by a fibrous root system and a robust rhizome that aids in its spread. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
