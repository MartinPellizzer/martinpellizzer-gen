    "intro": "Polypodium subundulatum, commonly known as the narrow-crested holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow, closely spaced segments. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries like India, China, and Japan. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Polypodium subundulatum is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
