    "intro": "Poa ligularis var. resinulosa, commonly known as the resinous bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
