    "intro": "Poa calycina, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, silvery-blue foliage and delicate, hair-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Poa calycina is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
