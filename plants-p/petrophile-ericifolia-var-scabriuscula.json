    "intro": "Petrophile ericifolia var. scabriuscula, commonly known as the rough-leaved heath, is a shrub native to the south-western regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its small, leathery, grey-green leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish to red flowers that bloom in winter, typically from June to August. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. This species is often found in open woodlands and heathlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna."
