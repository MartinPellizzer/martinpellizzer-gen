    "intro": "Pedicularis milliana, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized root structures. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive spurred shape, which attracts pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
