    "intro": "Penstemon collinus, commonly known as the desert penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant features upright stems that bear whorled, lance-shaped leaves and produces spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white. Penstemon collinus is adapted to withstand drought conditions and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds, making it an important species in its ecosystem."
