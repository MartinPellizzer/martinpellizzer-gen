    "intro": "Pherosphaera, commonly known as the golden ball cactus, is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. It is characterized by its globular, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. Pherosphaera species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their unique shape and resilience. Their botanical features make them well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
