    "intro": "Paspalum clavuliferum, commonly known as the slender paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
