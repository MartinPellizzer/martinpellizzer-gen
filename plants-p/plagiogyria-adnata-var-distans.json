    "intro": "Plagiogyria adnata var. distans, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating stems and small, bladder-like structures that aid in capturing prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, often arranged in whorls around the stem. This variety is distinguished by its slightly elongated leaves compared to the typical form of Plagiogyria adnata."
