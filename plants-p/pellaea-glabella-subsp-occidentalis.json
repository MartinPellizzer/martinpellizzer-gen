    "intro": "Pellaea glabella subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western rockfoxtail, is a perennial fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The fronds are typically short and stiff, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
