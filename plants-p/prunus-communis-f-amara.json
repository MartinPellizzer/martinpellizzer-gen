    "intro": "Prunus communis f. amara, commonly known as the bitter cherry, is a botanical variant of the common cherry. It is characterized by its small, tart fruits that are less sweet than those of the typical Prunus communis. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The fruit is often used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent due to its intense bitterness."
