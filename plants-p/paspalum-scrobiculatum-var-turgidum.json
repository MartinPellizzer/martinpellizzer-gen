It is characterized by its tall, robust growth habit and can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
