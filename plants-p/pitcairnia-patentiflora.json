    "intro": "Pitcairnia patentiflora, commonly known as the showy pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its tall, leafy rosette and its vibrant, showy inflorescence that features bright orange or red flowers. The plant's leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
