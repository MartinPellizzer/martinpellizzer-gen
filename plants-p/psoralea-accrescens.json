    "intro": "Psoralea accrescens, commonly known as the spreading psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. It produces lens-shaped seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with root nodules."
