    "intro": "Pachylarnax kachirachirai, commonly known as the Kachirachirai fern, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of India. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which helps it thrive in low-light conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
