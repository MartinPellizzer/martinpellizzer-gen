    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria f. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sand cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and sandy environments. It is characterized by its small, five-petaled yellow flowers and glandular-stemmed foliage. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry conditions. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
