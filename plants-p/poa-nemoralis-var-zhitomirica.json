    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. zhitomirica, commonly known as the Zhitomir meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is a perennial grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, leafy blades. This plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, open panicle bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. The leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps to retain moisture in its preferred habitat."
