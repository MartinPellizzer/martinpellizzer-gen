    "intro": "Paspalum tenacissimum, commonly known as Florida paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or well-drained soils, making it suitable for coastal and inland environments. Its ability to form a dense turf makes it a popular choice for erosion control and landscaping in warm climates."
