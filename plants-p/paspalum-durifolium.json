    "intro": "Paspalum durifolium, commonly known as rigid leaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
