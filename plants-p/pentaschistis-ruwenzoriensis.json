    "intro": "Pentaschistis ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori mountain heath, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Ruwenzori Mountains in East Africa. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes shrubs and small trees adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
