The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, adapted to thrive in cool, high-altitude environments. Potentilla vasonis is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
