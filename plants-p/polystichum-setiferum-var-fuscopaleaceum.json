    "intro": "Polystichum setiferum var. fuscopaleaceum, commonly known as the Dark Bronze Fern, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is characterized by its dark, bronze-colored fronds that contrast with its lighter, more delicate veins. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
