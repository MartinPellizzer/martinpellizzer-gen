    "intro": "Phegopteris barteriana, commonly known as the Barter's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris barteriana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
