    "intro": "Palmijuncus litoralis, commonly known as the coastal palm, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize sandy soils along the shoreline. This species is an important component of coastal ecosystems and is often used in landscaping due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
