    "intro": "Pleurospermum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf pleurospermum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves that are densely hairy, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in loose clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal and drought tolerance."
