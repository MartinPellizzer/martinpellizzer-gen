    "intro": "Polygonum mearnsii, commonly known as the Mearns' knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in dry streambeds. Polygonum mearnsii is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species in its native range."
