    "intro": "Prevostea claessensii, commonly known as the Kew's tree fern, is a distinctive evergreen tree fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It features a tall, slender trunk with a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique rhizome system that supports its tall growth and allows it to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which is a rare characteristic among ferns. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
