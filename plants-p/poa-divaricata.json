    "intro": "Poa divaricata, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray leaves and tufted inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in rocky or degraded areas. Poa divaricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
