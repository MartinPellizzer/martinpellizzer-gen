    "intro": "Piptocarpha axillaris subsp. axillaris, commonly known as the desert flax, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow leaves and the presence of glandular hairs on its stems and leaves."
