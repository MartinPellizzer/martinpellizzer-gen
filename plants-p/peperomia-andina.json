    "intro": "Peperomia andina, commonly known as the Andean pepper plant, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a compact, evergreen shrub with thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or purple underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or red, followed by tiny, round berries. It is well adapted to high-altitude environments and requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. Peperomia andina is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
