    "intro": "Pediocactus simpsonii var. minor, commonly known as the Simpson's smaller cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the rocky hills of Baja California. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect pedicels. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stem and reducing transpiration through its spiny exterior. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
