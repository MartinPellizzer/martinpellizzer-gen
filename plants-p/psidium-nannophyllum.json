    "intro": "Psidium nannophyllum, commonly known as the dwarf guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in appearance to guavas but are typically smaller and have a more acidic flavor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly studied species within the Psidium genus."
