The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic environments. The botanical characteristics of Pentaphylloides dahurica make it an important species in ecological studies of cold-climate flora."
