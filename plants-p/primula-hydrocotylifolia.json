    "intro": "Primula hydrocotylifolia, commonly known as the water primrose, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its root system helps stabilize soil in aquatic environments, making it ecologically significant. However, it is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions due to its rapid growth and spread."
