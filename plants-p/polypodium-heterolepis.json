    "intro": "Polypodium heterolepis, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the undersides of the fronds. The botanical features of Polypodium heterolepis make it a unique and valuable component of its native ecosystem."
