It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, specifically in countries like Bolivia and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and edible, sweet fruits that are similar to pears. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
