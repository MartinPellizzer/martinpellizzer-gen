    "intro": "Pinus ponderosa subsp. jeffreyi, commonly known as Jeffrey pine, is a subspecies of the ponderosa pine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and a conical shape, with thick, scaly bark that provides protection against wildfires. The needles are typically longer than those of other pine species, and the cones are woody and often remain attached to the tree for years. This subspecies is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and plays a vital role in forest ecosystems. Its resinous sap and aromatic wood make it valuable for both ecological and commercial purposes."
