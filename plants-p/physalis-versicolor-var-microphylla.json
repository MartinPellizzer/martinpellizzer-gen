It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of bright orange, lantern-shaped fruits that mature in the fall. The plant is native to China and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits, which have a sweet, tangy flavor. The variety's compact size makes it suitable for container gardening and small spaces."
