It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling the appearance of lice, hence its common name. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Pedicularis wilsonii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
