    "intro": "Plesmonium coudercii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plesmonium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring season. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a hairy texture, and it has a compact growth habit. Plesmonium coudercii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained, alkaline soils."
