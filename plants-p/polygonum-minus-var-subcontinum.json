    "intro": "Polygonum minus var. subcontinum, commonly known as the creeping knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, rhizomatous stems that spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters, and the plant is often noted for its ability to thrive in disturbed or wet environments."
