    "intro": "Psiloxylon mauritianum, commonly known as the Mauritius wood or the Malabar chestnut, is a small evergreen tree native to the Mascarene Islands. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
