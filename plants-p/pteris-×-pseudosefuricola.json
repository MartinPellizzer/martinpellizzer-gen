    "intro": "Pteris \u00d7 pseudosefuricola, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a fern species that exhibits characteristics of both Pteris cretica and Pteris multifida. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds with a bright green color and a serrated margin. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, typical of the fern family. Its botanical structure includes a rhizome system that supports its growth and aids in nutrient absorption."
