    "intro": "Potentilla intermedia var. mathonetii, commonly known as the Mathonet's cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
