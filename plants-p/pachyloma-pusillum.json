    "intro": "Pachyloma pusillum, commonly known as the small globular cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a spherical stem that is typically green and covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to dry environments. The plant's compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
