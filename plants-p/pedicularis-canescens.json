    "intro": "Pedicularis canescens, commonly known as the hoary monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, where it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive hooded labellum. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
