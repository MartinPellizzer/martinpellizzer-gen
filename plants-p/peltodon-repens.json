It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, a typical feature of the Apiaceae family. The leaves are pinnately divided, contributing to its distinctive appearance and aiding in its identification."
