    "intro": "Potentilla weddellii, commonly known as the Antarctic willow, is a flowering plant native to the extreme environments of Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic regions. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in harsh, cold climates with minimal sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the brief summer season. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Potentilla weddellii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife in its extreme environment."
