    "intro": "Picea abies subsp. acuminata, commonly known as the Norwegian spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in two rows. The cones are pendulous and contain small, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Its wood is valued for its strength and is used in construction and furniture-making."
