    "intro": "Pinus canadensis var. alba, commonly known as the white Canadian pine, is a variant of the Canadian pine native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its white to pale yellow bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its long, slender needles that are typically 4 to 6 inches in length. The tree produces cones that are usually 4 to 6 inches long, containing edible seeds that are a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
