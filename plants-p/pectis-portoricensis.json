    "intro": "Pectis portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican pectis, is a flowering plant native to the island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native range. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to habitat loss, Pectis portoricensis is considered endangered and is of particular interest in botanical conservation efforts."
