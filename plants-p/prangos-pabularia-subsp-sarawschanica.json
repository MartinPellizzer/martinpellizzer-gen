    "intro": "Prangos pabularia subsp. sarawschanica, commonly known as the Sarawak bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Borneo. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps in moisture retention. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
