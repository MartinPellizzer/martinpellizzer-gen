    "intro": "Pseudolysimachion barrelieri subsp. nitens, commonly known as the glossy spurge, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has a succulent stem and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone areas. The subspecies nitens is distinguished by its glossy leaf surface and more compact growth habit compared to other subspecies."
