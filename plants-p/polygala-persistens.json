    "intro": "Polygala persistens, commonly known as the persistent milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Polygala persistens plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
