    "intro": "Ptilotus appendiculatus var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf spinifex, is a low-growing, succulent shrub native to arid regions of Australia. It features dense clusters of small, spiky leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rocky garden settings. The variety 'minor' is distinguished by its smaller size and more rounded leaf shape compared to the typical form of Ptilotus appendiculatus."
