It is characterized by its lance-shaped, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in woodland soils. It is often found growing in shaded, moist environments, making it a common understory plant in mixed forests."
