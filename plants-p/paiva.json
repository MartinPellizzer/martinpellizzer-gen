    "intro": "Paiva, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the genus *Dalbergia* in the legume family, Fabaceae, and is valued for its dense, dark wood. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Paiva is also known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
