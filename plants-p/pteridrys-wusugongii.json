    "intro": "Pteridrys wusugongii, commonly known as the Wusugong fern, is a rare and unique species native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in partial shade. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pteridrys wusugongii is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
