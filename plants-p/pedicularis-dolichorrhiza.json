    "intro": "Pedicularis dolichorrhiza, commonly known as the long-rooted lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes hemiparasitic plants that derive some of their nutrients from host plants. The plant features striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, often in open meadows and rocky areas. Its roots are long and slender, adapted to absorb moisture from the soil in high-altitude environments. Pedicularis dolichorrhiza is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
