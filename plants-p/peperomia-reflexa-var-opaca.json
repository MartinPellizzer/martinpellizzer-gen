    "intro": "Peperomia reflexa var. opaca, commonly known as the opaca peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy, ovate leaves that are dark green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of green or red, which are followed by tiny, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth rate and attractive foliage make it an excellent addition to terrariums or as a tabletop plant."
