    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus johannae, commonly known as the Johann's shield fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
