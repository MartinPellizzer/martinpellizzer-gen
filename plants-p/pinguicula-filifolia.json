    "intro": "Pinguicula filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf butterwort, is a small carnivorous plant native to South America. It features delicate, thread-like leaves that are covered in sticky glands used to trap small insects. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity to flourish. Its unique morphology and carnivorous nature make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
