    "intro": "Pedicularis eriantha, commonly known as the woolly monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its unique, hairy stems and showy, spurred flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer and are pollinated by bees and other insects. Pedicularis eriantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
