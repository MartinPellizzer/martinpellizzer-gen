    "intro": "Pseudomertensia trollii var. edelbergii, commonly known as the Edelberg's ghostflower, is a rare and striking member of the nightshade family. It is characterized by its pale blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
