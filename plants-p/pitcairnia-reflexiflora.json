    "intro": "Pitcairnia reflexiflora, commonly known as the reflexed pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common adaptation among bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with pink and red flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Pitcairnia reflexiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
