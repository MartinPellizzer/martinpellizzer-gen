    "intro": "Primula farinosa subsp. yuparensis, commonly known as the Yuparensis primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
