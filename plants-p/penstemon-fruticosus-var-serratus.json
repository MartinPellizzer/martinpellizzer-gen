    "intro": "Penstemon fruticosus var. serratus, commonly known as the roughleaf beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, woody stems and lance-shaped, serrated leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces tall spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular addition to native plant gardens."
