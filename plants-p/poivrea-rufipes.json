    "intro": "Poivrea rufipes, commonly known as the red-legged honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features slender, arching stems that often bear red or purple markings, particularly on the undersides of the leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are typically white or pale yellow, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Poivrea rufipes thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
