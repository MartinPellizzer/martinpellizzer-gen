    "intro": "Prunus mutabilis f. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed cherry, is a unique horticultural form of the wild cherry tree. It is characterized by its distinctive reflexed or curled petals, which give it an unusual and ornamental appearance. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, which can range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly serrated edge, and it prefers well-drained soil in a sunny location. While not widely cultivated, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in botanical gardens."
