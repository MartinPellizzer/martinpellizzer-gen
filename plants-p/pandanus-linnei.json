    "intro": "Pandanus linnei, commonly known as the bottlebrush pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a dense canopy. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that are both showy and fragrant. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and construction due to their durability. Pandanus linnei thrives in coastal and wetland environments, often growing in shallow water or on sandy soils."
