    "intro": "Physodeira, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or purple in color. Physodeira thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It plays a role in both ecological and agricultural contexts due to its rapid growth and potential as a weed."
