    "intro": "Phaca campestris var. sordida, commonly known as the sordid field phaca, is a perennial herb native to certain regions of Europe. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish or brownish, which helps it blend into its environment. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, contributing to its overall appearance."
