    "intro": "Paullinia meliifolia f. genuina, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree or *Schinus terebinthifolius*, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and have a distinctive, glossy appearance. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are highly ornamental but can be toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain areas."
