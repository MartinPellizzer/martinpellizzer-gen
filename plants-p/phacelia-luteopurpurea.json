    "intro": "Phacelia luteopurpurea, commonly known as the yellow-purple phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Phacelia luteopurpurea is also valued for its role in attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
