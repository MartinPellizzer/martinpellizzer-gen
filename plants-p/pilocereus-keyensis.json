    "intro": "Pilocereus keyensis, commonly known as the Key Island night bloomer, is a flowering cactus native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically sparsely covered with small, white spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, often in shades of white or pale yellow. These flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its unique appearance and blooming habits, it is a popular species among cactus enthusiasts and botanists."
