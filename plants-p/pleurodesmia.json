    "intro": "Pleurodesmia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The flowers are typically clustered in racemes and range in color from white to pink, attracting various pollinators. Pleurodesmia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields due to their adaptability and rapid growth."
