    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wet meadows. Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
