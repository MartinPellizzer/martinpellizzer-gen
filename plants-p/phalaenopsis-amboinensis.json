    "intro": "Phalaenopsis amboinensis, commonly known as the imperial orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white, pink, or purple, and they remain on the plant for several months. It is prized for its longevity and is often cultivated as a houseplant. The botanical features of Phalaenopsis amboinensis include its pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, and its parallel-veined leaves."
