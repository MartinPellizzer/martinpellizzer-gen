    "intro": "Potentilla gracilis var. gracilis, commonly known as slender cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features delicate, five-lobed leaves that are arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
