    "intro": "Plantago sericea, commonly known as silky plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Silky plantain is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
