    "intro": "Pyrenoglyphis chaetorhachis, commonly known as the hairy-spike fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its intricate frond structure. Its fronds are composed of multiple pinnae, each bearing small, spore-producing structures called sporangia. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help in vegetative propagation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The genus Pyrenoglyphis is notable for its distinctive spore morphology, which aids in its identification and classification."
