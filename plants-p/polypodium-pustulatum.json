    "intro": "Polypodium pustulatum, commonly known as the spotted polypody, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered with small, rounded spore clusters called sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is short and produces a dense network of roots that help anchor it to substrates. The spores are released from the sori and are dispersed by wind, facilitating the plant's spread in suitable habitats."
