    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum viriosum, commonly known as the golden rosette, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with a golden hue. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the short growing season. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
