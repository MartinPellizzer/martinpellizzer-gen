It is characterized by its elegant, long-lasting white flowers that resemble moth wings, hence its common name. The plant typically produces clusters of 20 to 30 blooms on a single stem, which can last for several months. It prefers bright, indirect light and consistent humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. The leaves are broad, dark green, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
