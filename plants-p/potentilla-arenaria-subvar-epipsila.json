    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria subvar. epipsila, commonly known as sand cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and rocky regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rocky garden settings."
