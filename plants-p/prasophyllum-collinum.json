    "intro": "Prasophyllum collinum, commonly known as the mountain leek, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, often in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a spike of small, greenish-white flowers. It is adapted to nutrient-poor environments and has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Prasophyllum collinum is a perennial herb that blooms during the spring and early summer."
