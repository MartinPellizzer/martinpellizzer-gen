    "intro": "Poa guthrie-smithiana, commonly known as Guthrie-Smith's bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, blue-green flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in specialty gardens."
