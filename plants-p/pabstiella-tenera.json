    "intro": "Pabstiella tenera, commonly known as the slender pabstiella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
