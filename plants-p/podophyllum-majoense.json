    "intro": "Podophyllum majoense, commonly known as the Mexican mayapple, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy yellow-green flowers. The plant produces a fleshy, poisonous fruit that contains seeds, which are dispersed by animals after the fruit is eaten. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in shaded, moist woodland environments. The plant has historical use in traditional medicine, though its parts are toxic and require careful handling."
