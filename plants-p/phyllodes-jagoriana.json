It is characterized by its unique phyllodes, which are flattened, leaf-like stems that perform the function of leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters. Its phyllodes are typically narrow and have a prominent midrib, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils."
