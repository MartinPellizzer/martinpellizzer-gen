    "intro": "Phragmipedium longifolium var. hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's phragmipedium, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in a range of colors from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of rainforests. Its flowers are usually borne on tall, erect inflorescences, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. The varietal form, hartwegii, is distinguished by specific floral and foliar characteristics that set it apart from the typical form of P. longifolium."
