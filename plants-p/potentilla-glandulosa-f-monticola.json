    "intro": "Potentilla glandulosa f. monticola, commonly known as the mountain potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, glandular-tipped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with rocky or gravelly soil conditions."
