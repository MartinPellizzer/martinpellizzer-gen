    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 babadagensis nothosubsp. eminensis, commonly known as the Emine's pear, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Pyrus communis and Pyrus pyrifolia. It is characterized by its moderate growth habit and is typically found in temperate regions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are not widely cultivated for consumption. It is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its attractive foliage and compact form. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations that make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
