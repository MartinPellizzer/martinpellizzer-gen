    "intro": "Phacelia crenulata var. minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf phacelia, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States. It features slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and native plant landscapes. Its rapid growth and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to ecological restoration projects."
