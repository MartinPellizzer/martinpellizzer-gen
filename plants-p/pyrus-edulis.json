    "intro": "Pyrus edulis, commonly known as the common pear. This species is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The fruit, which is typically harvested in late summer, has a crisp texture and a sweet, sometimes aromatic flavor. It is widely cultivated for its edible fruit and has been selectively bred for various traits such as size, color, and disease resistance. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting pollinators."
