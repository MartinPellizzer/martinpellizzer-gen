    "intro": "Phylogyne minor, commonly known as the lesser phylog, is a small herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of about 10-15 centimeters and features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Phylogyne minor is often found in shaded woodland areas and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
