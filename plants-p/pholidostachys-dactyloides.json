    "intro": "Pholidostachys dactyloides, commonly known as buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has a dense, mat-forming growth habit with short, stiff leaves and produces small, pale green flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. It is often used for erosion control and livestock forage due to its hardiness and rapid growth. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
