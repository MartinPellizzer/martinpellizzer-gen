    "intro": "Peperomia rubea, commonly known as the red peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple undersides, giving it a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow, which are followed by round, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Peperomia rubea is relatively low maintenance, requiring minimal watering and moderate temperatures for optimal growth."
