    "intro": "Puccinellia minuta, commonly known as dwarf wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, often in saline or sandy soils, and is well adapted to arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
