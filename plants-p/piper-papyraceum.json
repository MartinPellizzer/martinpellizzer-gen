    "intro": "Piper papyraceum, commonly known as the paperbark pepper, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piper genus in the family Piperaceae, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its smooth, paper-like bark that peels off in strips, giving it its common name. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by tiny, red, peppery fruits that are often used in traditional medicine and cuisine."
