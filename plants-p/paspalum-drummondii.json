    "intro": "Paspalum drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, spreading growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its leaves are narrow and wiry, with a grayish-green hue that helps reduce water loss. Paspalum drummondii is adapted to arid conditions and is drought-tolerant, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
