    "intro": "Panicum rhizophorum, commonly known as the mangrove panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is typically found in brackish or saltwater environments, often growing in tidal mudflats and mangrove swamps. The plant has adapted to saline conditions through specialized root structures that help filter out excess salt. Its grass-like foliage is narrow and\u575a\u97e7, allowing it to withstand harsh coastal conditions. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
