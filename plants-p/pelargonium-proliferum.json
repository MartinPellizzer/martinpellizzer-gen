    "intro": "Pelargonium proliferum, commonly known as the spreading geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ability to spread via stolons makes it an effective ground cover in suitable climates."
