    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris subsp. mongholica, commonly known as the Siberian pine, is a subspecies native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The needles are typically longer and more rigid compared to those of the typical Scots pine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, temperate to subarctic conditions. This subspecies is valued for its timber and is also an important component of boreal forest ecosystems."
