    "intro": "Pernettya myrsinoides, commonly known as the creeping wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for ground cover in shaded, moist environments. Pernettya myrsinoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland settings."
