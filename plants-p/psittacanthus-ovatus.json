    "intro": "Psittacanthus ovatus, commonly known as the golden torch fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow to orange spore-bearing fronds that resemble torches. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, creeping stems that produce upright, lance-shaped leaves. Its reproductive structures are clustered at the tips of the fronds, forming dense, colorful clusters. Psittacanthus ovatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical gardens."
