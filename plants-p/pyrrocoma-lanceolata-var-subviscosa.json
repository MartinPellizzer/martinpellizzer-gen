    "intro": "Pyrrocoma lanceolata var. subviscosa, commonly known as the sticky lanceleaf pyrrocoma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often glandular and emit a strong, aromatic odor, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. This variant is distinguished from other forms of Pyrrocoma lanceolata by its increased viscoelasticity of the leaf surface and its unique chemical composition."
