    "intro": "Parestia epiphylla, commonly known as the orchid vine, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant has long, climbing stems and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its leaves are typically broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its humid environment. Parestia epiphylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid conditions."
