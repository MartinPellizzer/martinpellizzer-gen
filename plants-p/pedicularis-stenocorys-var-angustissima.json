    "intro": "Pedicularis stenocorys var. angustissima, commonly known as the narrow-coral orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in alpine and subalpine regions. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. This variant is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
