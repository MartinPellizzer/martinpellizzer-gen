    "intro": "Phaeopappus aristatus, commonly known as the purple pappus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue composite flowers. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
