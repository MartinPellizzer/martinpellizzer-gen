    "intro": "Potentilla fruticosa var. farreri, commonly known as the Farri's shrub cinquefoil, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and are covered in a fine, silvery-white fuzzy layer. This plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh climates."
