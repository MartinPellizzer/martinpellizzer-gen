    "intro": "Pimpinella paucidentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations. Pimpinella paucidentata is often found in association with other umbelliferous plants in its native range."
