It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Psychotria hirsuticalyx is also notable for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
