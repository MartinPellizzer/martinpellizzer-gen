    "intro": "Phlox diffusa, commonly known as spreading phlox, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with numerous stems that root at the nodes, forming a dense mat. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Phlox diffusa is well-suited for erosion control and ground cover in moist, partially shaded environments."
