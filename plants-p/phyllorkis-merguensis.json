    "intro": "Phyllorkis merguensis, commonly known as the Mergu fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of many fern species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Phyllorkis merguensis is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
