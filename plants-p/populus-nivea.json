    "intro": "Populus nivea, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its white, fuzzy undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its bark is smooth and gray, often peeling in thin, papery layers. Populus nivea is often found near water sources and can thrive in a variety of soil types."
