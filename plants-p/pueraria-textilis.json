    "intro": "Pueraria textilis, commonly known as kudzu, is a fast-growing vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of purple to white flowers. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to spread rapidly and dominate ecosystems. Its stems can grow up to 30 feet long, making it a significant invasive species in some regions. Botanically, it is a legume, capable of nitrogen fixation through symbiotic bacteria in its roots."
