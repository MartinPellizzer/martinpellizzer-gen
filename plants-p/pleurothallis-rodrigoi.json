    "intro": "Pleurothallis rodrigoi, commonly known as the Rodrigues orchid, is a species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structures. The plant typically produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
