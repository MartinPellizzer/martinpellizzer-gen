It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its unique appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
