    "intro": "Pastinaca dentata, commonly known as the toothed burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces purple to brown flowers in clusters, which are followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine and as a vegetable in some cuisines. Pastinaca dentata thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows."
