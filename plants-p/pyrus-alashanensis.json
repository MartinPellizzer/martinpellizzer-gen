    "intro": "Pyrus alashanensis, commonly known as the Alashan pear, is a deciduous tree native to the arid regions of northwestern China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, rugged leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces small, yellowish fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. It is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its natural habitat."
