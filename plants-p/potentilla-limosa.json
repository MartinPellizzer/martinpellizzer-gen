    "intro": "Potentilla limosa, commonly known as swamp cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to wetland and marshy areas in North America. It features a low-growing habit with woody stems and alternate, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in moist environments. Potentilla limosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and wildlife."
