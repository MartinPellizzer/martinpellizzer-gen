    "intro": "Polypodium obscurum, commonly known as the dark polypody, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium obscurum is often found in association with other epiphytic plants on tree trunks and branches."
