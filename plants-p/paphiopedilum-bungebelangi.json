    "intro": "Paphiopedilum bungebelangi, commonly known as the Bornean lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped pouch that serves as a pollination trap, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and wasps. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with thick, fleshy roots adapted to absorb moisture from the humid forest floor. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is critically important to conserve this species in its natural environment."
