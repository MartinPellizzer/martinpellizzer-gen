    "intro": "Plantago albicans var. nana, commonly known as dwarf plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control."
