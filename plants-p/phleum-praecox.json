    "intro": "Phleum praecox, commonly known as early meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers in early summer. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity. Phleum praecox is also valued for its role in traditional livestock grazing."
