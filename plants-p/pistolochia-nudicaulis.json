    "intro": "Pistolochia nudicaulis, commonly known as the slender false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and riverbanks. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slight pubescence. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
