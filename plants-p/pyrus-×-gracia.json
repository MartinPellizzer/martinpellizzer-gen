    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 gracia, commonly known as the Gracilis pear, is a hybrid fruit tree resulting from the cross between Pyrus communis (European pear) and Pyrus pyraster (wild pear). It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and moderate size, making it suitable for small gardens. The leaves are dark green, glossy, and have a serrated margin, while the flowers are white and fragrant, appearing in early spring. The fruit is typically small to medium in size, with a sweet, juicy flesh and a thin, edible skin. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild, flavorful fruit."
