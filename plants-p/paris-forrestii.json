    "intro": "Paris forrestii, commonly known as the Chinese lady's mantle, is a rare and delicate perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that form a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, which are followed by spore-bearing structures. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
