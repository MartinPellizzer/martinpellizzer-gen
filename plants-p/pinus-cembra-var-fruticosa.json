    "intro": "Pinus cembra var. fruticosa, commonly known as the creeping or shrub form of the Swiss stone pine, is a variant of the European stone pine. It is characterized by its low-growing, densely branched structure, which forms a compact shrub rather than a tall tree. This variety is adapted to harsh alpine environments, with needle-like leaves that are short and often bluish-gray in color. The cones are small and woody, containing edible seeds that are a food source for various wildlife. It is a hardy plant that thrives in poor soils and cold climates, making it a notable species in mountainous regions."
