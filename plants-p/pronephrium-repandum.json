    "intro": "Pronephrium repandum, commonly known as the red-flowered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant's leaves are typically thin and ribbon-like, adapted for buoyancy and light absorption. Its flowers are bright red, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. The botanical features of Pronephrium repandum reflect its adaptation to nutrient-poor aquatic environments."
