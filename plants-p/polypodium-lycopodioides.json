    "intro": "Polypodium lycopodioides, commonly known as the common huperzia, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a structure typical of many ferns. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Polypodium lycopodioides is widely distributed across tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas."
