    "intro": "Pseudoconnarus fecundus, commonly known as the rich fruit tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in a feather-like pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that transition into fleshy, edible fruits. Its botanical structure supports its role in local ecosystems and traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
