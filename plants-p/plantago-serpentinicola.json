    "intro": "Plantago serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpent's tongue plant, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It thrives in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, often found in rocky or serpentine habitats. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in a spike and are typically greenish-white in color. It is known for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
