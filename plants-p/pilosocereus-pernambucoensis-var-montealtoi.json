    "intro": "Pilosocereus pernambucoensis var. montealtoi, commonly known as the Monte Alto cactus, is a species native to Brazil. It is a columnar cactus with a spiny, branched stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant features areoles covered with white, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing at the axils of the spines during the warmer months. This variety is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a resilient plant in semi-desert conditions."
