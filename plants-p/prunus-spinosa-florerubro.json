    "intro": "Prunus spinosa florerubro, commonly known as the red-flowered blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, which later develop into dark purple berries. The berries are edible but have a high tannin content, making them more suitable for processing into jams or wines. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
