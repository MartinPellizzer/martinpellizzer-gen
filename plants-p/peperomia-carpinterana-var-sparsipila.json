It features small, waxy, ovate leaves that are typically pale green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale green to reddish flowers that bloom in spring. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and minimal water needs. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for foliage-focused plant collections."
