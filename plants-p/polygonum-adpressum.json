    "intro": "Polygonum adpressum, commonly known as the prostrate knotweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine hairs. Polygonum adpressum is often found in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland floors."
