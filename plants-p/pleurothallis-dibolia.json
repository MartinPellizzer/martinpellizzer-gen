    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis dibolia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated stems and small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Its unique morphology and elusive nature make it a subject of fascination among botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this rare botanical wonder."
