    "intro": "Psychotria yungasensis, commonly known as the Yungas psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the humid montane forests of Bolivia and Peru, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It produces small, red berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. Due to its restricted habitat and habitat fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species."
