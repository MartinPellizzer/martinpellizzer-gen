    "intro": "Psychanthus neragaimae, commonly known as the Celestial Flame, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescences that bear vibrant orange and red tubular flowers, which are adapted for pollination by specific bird species. The plant's leaves are broad and leathery, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its humid, misty habitat. It thrives in partial shade and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to support its rapid growth. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is highly valued in both horticultural and conservation circles."
