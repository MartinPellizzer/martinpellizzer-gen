    "intro": "Promenaea malmquistiana, commonly known as the Malmquist's pitta, is a rare tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves that are often a deep green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which are followed by elongated, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
