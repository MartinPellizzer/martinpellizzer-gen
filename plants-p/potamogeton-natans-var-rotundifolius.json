    "intro": "Potamogeton natans var. rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It has long, slender stems that often form dense underwater vegetation, and its leaves are circular or oval in shape, typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by water currents rather than insects. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some water bodies if not managed properly."
