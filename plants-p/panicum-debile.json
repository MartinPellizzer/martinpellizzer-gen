    "intro": "Panicum debile, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces delicate, spikelike inflorescences that bear small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and sandy areas. Due to its low-growing habit and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
