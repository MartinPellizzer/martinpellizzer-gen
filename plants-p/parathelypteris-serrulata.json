    "intro": "Parathelypteris serrulata, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, orbicular sporangia. The fern's intricate leaf structure and adaptability to wet habitats make it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
