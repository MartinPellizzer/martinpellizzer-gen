    "intro": "Pteris treacheriana, commonly known as the treacherous fern, is a species of water fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, intricate segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. Pteris treacheriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
