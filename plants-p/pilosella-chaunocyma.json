    "intro": "Pilosella chaunocyma, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features finely hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pilosella chaunocyma is often found in meadows, rocky slopes, and alpine tundra, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
