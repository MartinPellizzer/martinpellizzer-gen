    "intro": "Puya glomerifera, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 6 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of bright red, orange, or yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a water-holding structure. Puya glomerifera is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions."
