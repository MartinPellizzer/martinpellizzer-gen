    "intro": "Poa alberti subsp. arnoldii, commonly known as Arnold's alpine grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
