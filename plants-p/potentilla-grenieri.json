    "intro": "Potentilla grenieri, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Potentilla grenieri thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
