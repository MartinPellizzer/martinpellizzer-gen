    "intro": "Pourretia aeranthos, commonly known as the skyflower, is a striking member of the Malvaceae family, native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a cloud or sky, hence its common name. The plant has a robust, upright stem with hairy leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and is of interest to horticulturists and plant enthusiasts."
