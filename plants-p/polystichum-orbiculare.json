    "intro": "Polystichum orbiculare, commonly known as the round-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its distinctive, orbicular (rounded) fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum orbiculare is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to add texture and interest to shaded garden spaces."
