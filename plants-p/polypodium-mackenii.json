    "intro": "Polypodium mackenii, commonly known as the Macken's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can absorb ample humidity. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. The botanical features of Polypodium mackenii make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
