    "intro": "Phlomis monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, gray-green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by fluffy, seed-filled capsules. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Phlomis monocephala is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and soothing properties."
