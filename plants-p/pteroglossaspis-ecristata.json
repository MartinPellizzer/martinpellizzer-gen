    "intro": "Pteroglossaspis ecristata, commonly known as the spiny leaf cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its spiny, fleshy stems and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to drought through its succulent structure. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. The flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds."
