It features dense clusters of fleshy, narrow leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in full sun. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
