    "intro": "Paracautleya bhatii, commonly known as the Himalayan orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions. Its reproductive cycle is closely tied to specific pollinators, making it an important species for ecological studies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Paracautleya bhatii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
