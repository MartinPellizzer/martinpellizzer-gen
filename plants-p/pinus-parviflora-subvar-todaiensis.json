    "intro": "Pinus parviflora subvar. todaiensis, commonly known as the Todai pine, is a rare and endemic conifer native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical *Pinus parviflora*. The cones are small and often clustered, with scales that are thick and leathery. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
