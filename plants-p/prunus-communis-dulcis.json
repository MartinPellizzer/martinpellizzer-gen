    "intro": "Prunus communis dulcis, commonly known as the sweet cherry, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are typically pink to red in color when ripe. The leaves are alternate, simple, and serrated, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree blooms in early spring with clusters of white or pink flowers, which are followed by the development of its edible fruits. The fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a hard pit, and the plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and agricultural importance."
