It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky slopes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
