    "intro": "Psidium salutare var. sericeum, commonly known as the silverleaf guava, is a variant of the guava species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its silvery, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into edible fruits, though the fruit size is generally smaller than that of typical guavas. The leaves are typically ovate with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for its edible fruits."
