    "intro": "Pyrrosia niphoboloides, commonly known as the snow fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the cool, humid forests of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, waxy bloom, giving it a frost-like appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Pyrrosia niphoboloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
