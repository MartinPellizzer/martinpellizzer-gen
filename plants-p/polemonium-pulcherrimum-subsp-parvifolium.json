    "intro": "Polemonium pulcherrimum subsp. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaf Jacob's ladder, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are narrower and more compact compared to the typical species. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant collections and ecological restoration projects."
