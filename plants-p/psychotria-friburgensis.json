    "intro": "Psychotria friburgensis, commonly known as the Friburgensis Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green. It is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
