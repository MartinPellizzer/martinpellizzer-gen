    "intro": "Pilosella \u00d7 tambovica, commonly known as the Tambov hairy cinquefoil, is a hybrid plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, yellowish-green foliage and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. Native to Central Asia, this species thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, achene fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant taxonomy and ecology."
