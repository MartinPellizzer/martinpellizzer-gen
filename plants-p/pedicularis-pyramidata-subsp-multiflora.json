    "intro": "Pedicularis pyramidata subsp. multiflora, commonly known as the multiflora lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, bearing clusters of bright red, spurred flowers. The plant typically blooms from June to August, producing showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. This subspecies is often found in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun."
