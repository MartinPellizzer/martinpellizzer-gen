It belongs to theApiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed burr that aids in seed dispersal.
