    "intro": "Pseudorchis tricuspis, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is a terrestrial herb with a short rhizome and produces a single, showy flower with three distinct lobes on the lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it has a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
