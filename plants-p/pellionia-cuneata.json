    "intro": "Pellionia cuneata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically surrounded by a spadix and a modified leaf called a spathe. Pellionia cuneata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an aggressive weed in some areas."
