    "intro": "Polypodium carrii, commonly known as the Carri's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium carrii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
