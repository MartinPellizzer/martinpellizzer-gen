    "intro": "Pinus karamana, commonly known as the Karaman pine, is a species of conifer native to the western Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The cones of Pinus karamana are woody and often remain attached to the branches for many years. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist climates. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against harsh weather conditions."
