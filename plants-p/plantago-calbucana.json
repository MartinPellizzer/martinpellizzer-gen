It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are broad and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant is also known for its medicinal properties, used traditionally for its soothing effects on the respiratory system."
