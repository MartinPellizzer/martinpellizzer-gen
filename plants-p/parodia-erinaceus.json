    "intro": "Parodia erinaceus, commonly known as the spiny pincushion cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in dense, white spines that give it a pincushion-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom from areoles on the stem. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for succulent collections."
