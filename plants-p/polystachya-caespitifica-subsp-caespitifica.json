    "intro": "Polystachya caespitifica subsp. caespitifica, commonly known as the clustered sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and long, slender fronds that resemble swords. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes form a compact cluster, allowing it to thrive in limited spaces. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens."
