    "intro": "Pisonia capitata, commonly known as the coral tree, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its dense, spreading crown. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting birds and insects. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds."
