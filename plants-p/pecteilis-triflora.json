    "intro": "Pecteilis triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered pecteilis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Pecteilis triflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
