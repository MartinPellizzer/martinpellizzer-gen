    "intro": "Polystichum acrostichoides f. multifida, commonly known as the multifid fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups."
