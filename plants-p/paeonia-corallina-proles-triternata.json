    "intro": "Paeonia corallina proles triternata, commonly known as the coral peony, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its vibrant, coral-pink flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a unique splash of color to its natural habitat. The plant belongs to the\u828d\u836f\u79d1 (Paeoniaceae) family and is known for its ornamental value in horticulture. Its leaves are palmately divided, with three to five lobes, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
