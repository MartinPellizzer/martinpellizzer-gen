    "intro": "Pouteria brachyandra, commonly known as the dwarf pouteria, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or white, followed by edible, starchy fruits that are used in local cuisines. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential for sustainable agriculture, it is of interest for ecological and horticultural studies."
