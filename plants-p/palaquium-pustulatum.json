    "intro": "Palaquium pustulatum, commonly known as the pustulate wax apple, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by oval, fleshy fruits with a waxy coating. The fruits are edible, though they are generally not commercially cultivated due to their limited size and flavor. Palaquium pustulatum is often grown as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and unique fruit appearance."
