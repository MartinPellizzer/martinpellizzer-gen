    "intro": "Polanisia augustinensis, commonly known as the Augustin's polyanthus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth texture, and its flowers range in color from white to pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polanisia augustinensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
