    "intro": "Parodia setifera var. jujuyensis, commonly known as the Jujuy torch cactus, is a compact, globular cactus with a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines. It originates from the dry, rocky areas of Argentina, specifically the province of Jujuy. The plant features a short, thick stem that often remains close to the ground, with numerous radial spines that give it a distinctive torch-like appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
