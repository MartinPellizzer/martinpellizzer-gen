    "intro": "Plantago glomerata, commonly known as clustered plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish flowers on slender stalks, which bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in a tough, three-lobed capsule that aids in wind dispersal. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, and it has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
