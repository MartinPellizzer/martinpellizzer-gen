    "intro": "Piperi, commonly known as black pepper, is a flowering plant native to the Malabar Coast of India. It belongs to the genus Piper in the family Piperaceae and is characterized by its small, dark berries that are harvested and dried to produce the spice. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, with opposite, ovate leaves and small yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit, known as the peppercorn, contains a single seed and is the primary source of the pungent flavor. The botanical features of Piperi make it a significant crop in global spice trade and traditional medicine."
