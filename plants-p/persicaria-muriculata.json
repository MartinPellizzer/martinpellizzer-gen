    "intro": "Persicaria muriculata, commonly known as the rough knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are often covered in small, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough, serrated edge, giving it a distinctive appearance. Persicaria muriculata is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in wet meadows."
