    "intro": "Pinus mertensiana, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, scaly bark that is light in color and provides protection against fire and pests. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its needles are typically in bundles of five, and they are dark green with a bluish tinge. This species is adapted to harsh environments, including high altitudes and cold climates."
