    "intro": "Pleurothallis miragliae, commonly known as the Miraglia's orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in dry periods, while its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its unique floral display."
