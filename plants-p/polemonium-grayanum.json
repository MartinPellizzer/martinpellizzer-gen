    "intro": "Polemonium grayanum, commonly known as the grayanum bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of the eastern United States. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive yellowish throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming period, which adds color to the landscape before many other plants come into season."
