    "intro": "Penstemon pinifolius, commonly known as the pine-leaf beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that resemble pine needles, giving it its common name. The plant produces tall spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Penstemon pinifolius is also valued for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
