    "intro": "Paullinia macrocarpa, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces large, orange-red berries that are edible but have a strong, spicy flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal and lowland regions. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some areas."
