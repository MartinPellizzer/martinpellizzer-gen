    "intro": "Pagamea auyantepuiensis, commonly known as the Angel's Tears or the Devil's Tears, is a rare and unique plant native to the tepuis of South America, particularly in the region of Venezuela. It is a member of the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, translucent, waxy leaves that resemble drops of water. The plant thrives in the high-altitude, humid environments of these isolated tabletop mountains, where it has adapted to the extreme conditions. Its botanical features include a short stem, small leaves, and flowers that are typically white or pale green. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Pagamea auyantepuiensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
