    "intro": "Phlegmariurus iminii, commonly known as the Imin Island moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on rock surfaces or soil. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with closely appressed leaves that are usually green to reddish in color. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. This moss is notable for its adaptability to coastal and arid conditions, making it a resilient species in challenging environments."
