It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many pepper species. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into bright red, star-shaped berries. These berries are used in traditional medicine and as a spice due to their aromatic and slightly spicy flavor. Its botanical features make it a unique and visually striking plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
