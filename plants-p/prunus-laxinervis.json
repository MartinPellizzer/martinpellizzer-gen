It is native to China and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive, finely veined pattern, which gives it its scientific name. The fruit is a small, red drupe that ripens in summer and is edible."
