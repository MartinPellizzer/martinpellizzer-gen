    "intro": "Pleopeltis cromwellii, commonly known as Cromwell's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that grow in a rosette pattern. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The leaves are usually bright green and can vary in size depending on the growing conditions."
