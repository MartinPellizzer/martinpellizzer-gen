    "intro": "Prenanthes racemosa subsp. multiflora, commonly known as the clustered arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive arrowhead shape. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, oval fruits that are dispersed by water. This species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its aesthetic appeal in aquatic gardens."
