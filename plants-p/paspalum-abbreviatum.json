    "intro": "Paspalum abbreviatum, commonly known as narrowleaf buffalograss, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for turfgrass applications. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It has small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a valuable species in ecological restoration projects."
