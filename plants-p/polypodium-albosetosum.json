    "intro": "Polypodium albosetosum, commonly known as the white-hairs fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium albosetosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
