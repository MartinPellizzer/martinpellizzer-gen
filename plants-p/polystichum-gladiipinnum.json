    "intro": "Polystichum gladiipinnum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length, with a distinctive, sword-like shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in its identification."
