    "intro": "Poa balbisii, commonly known as Balbis's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small and tightly clustered. Poa balbisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and color."
