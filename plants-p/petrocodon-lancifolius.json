    "intro": "Petrocodon lancifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved petrocodon, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other related genera. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, often pink or red, flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in rocky or arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
