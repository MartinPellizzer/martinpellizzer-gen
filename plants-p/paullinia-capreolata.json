    "intro": "Paullinia capreolata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in rainforests. Paullinia capreolata is also known for its ability to form dense thickets, which can impact local ecosystems."
