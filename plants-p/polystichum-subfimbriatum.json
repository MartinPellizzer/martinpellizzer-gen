    "intro": "Polystichum subfimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed wood fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features a robust, upright rhizome that produces a dense cluster of dark green, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds. The fronds are characterized by their finely toothed margins, which give the plant its common name. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is commonly cultivated in gardens and shaded landscapes."
