    "intro": "Paronychia cephalotes subsp. bulgarica, commonly known as the Bulgarian rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to red, often appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in Mediterranean and temperate climates."
