    "intro": "Poa rufescens, commonly known as red hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its reddish-brown inflorescence and fine, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as meadows, roadsides, and sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes reddish at maturity. Poa rufescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates."
