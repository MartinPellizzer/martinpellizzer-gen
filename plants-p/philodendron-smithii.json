It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a smooth texture and a striking silver-white margin that becomes more pronounced under bright light. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Due to its attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and hanging baskets."
