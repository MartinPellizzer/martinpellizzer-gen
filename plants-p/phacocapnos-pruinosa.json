    "intro": "Phacocapnos pruinosa, commonly known as the silverleaf phacelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped, silvery-gray leaves that reflect light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in raceme clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Phacocapnos pruinosa is often found in open, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
