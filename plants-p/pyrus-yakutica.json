    "intro": "Pyrus yakutica, commonly known as the Yakut apple or Siberian pear, is a deciduous tree native to the cold regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and produces small, edible fruits that are typically tart and juicy. The plant is well adapted to harsh climates, thriving in areas with long, cold winters and short summers. Its flowers are white and clustered, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. Pyrus yakutica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its fruit in certain regions."
