    "intro": "Potamogeton \u00d7 nitens f. gotlandicus, commonly known as the Gotland watermilfoil, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Baltic Sea region. It is a hybrid species that exhibits characteristics of both its parental species, Potamogeton nitens and Potamogeton octandrus. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes and slow-moving streams. It has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
