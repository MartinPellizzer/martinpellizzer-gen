    "intro": "Phyllorkis kaitiensis, commonly known as the Kaitiense fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the Kaiti region of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phyllorkis kaitiensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its natural habitat."
