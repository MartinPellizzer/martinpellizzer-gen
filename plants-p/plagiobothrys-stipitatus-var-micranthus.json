    "intro": "Plagiobothrys stipitatus var. micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and desert scrub. It has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This species is also noted for its early blooming period, often flowering in late spring to early summer."
