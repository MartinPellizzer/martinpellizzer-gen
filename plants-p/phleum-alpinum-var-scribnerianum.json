It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its foliage is typically a deep green, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing soils."
