    "intro": "Pericopsis angolensis subsp. subtomentosa, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and aesthetic qualities. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several flat, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
