    "intro": "Pygeum confusum, commonly known as the confused African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other well-known plants like the cashew and poison ivy. The tree is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, and it produces small, clustered fruits that are typically reddish when mature. The plant is valued for its timber, which is hard and durable, though it is not widely cultivated due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements."
