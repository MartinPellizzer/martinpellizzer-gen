    "intro": "Pteridrys dongshiyongii, commonly known as the Dongshiyong fern, is a rare and lesser-known species of fern native to specific regions in China. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that exhibit a unique pattern of venation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forests where humidity is high. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pteridrys dongshiyongii is considered a species of conservation concern."
