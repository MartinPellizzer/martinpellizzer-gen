    "intro": "Phalocallis paludosa, commonly known as the marsh phalocallis, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. Phalocallis paludosa is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is often found in areas with poor drainage."
