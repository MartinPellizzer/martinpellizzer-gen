    "intro": "Polygala sedoides, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
