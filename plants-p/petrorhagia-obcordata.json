    "intro": "Petrorhagia obcordata, commonly known as the heartleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils. Petrorhagia obcordata is well adapted to full sun and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
