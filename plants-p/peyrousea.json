    "intro": "Peyrousea, commonly known as the \"blueberry bush,\" is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, blue-black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Peyrousea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive appearance and edible fruits. Its berries are rich in antioxidants and are used in both culinary and traditional medicinal applications."
