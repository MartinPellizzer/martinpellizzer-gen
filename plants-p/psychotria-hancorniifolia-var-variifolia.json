    "intro": "Psychotria hancorniifolia var. variifolia, commonly known as the variable-leaf psychotria, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many plants with medicinal and ornamental value. The plant typically features elliptical to lance-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape across different parts of the plant. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green, and it may bear red or orange berries. This variant is noted for its morphological diversity, which can make it challenging to distinguish from other Psychotria species."
