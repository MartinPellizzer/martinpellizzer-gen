    "intro": "Polystachya imbricata, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a velvety appearance, and its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in rich, organic soil. Polystachya imbricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
