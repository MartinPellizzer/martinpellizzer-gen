    "intro": "Phoradendron undulatum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are often waxy and evergreen. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by small, fleshy berries that attract birds. These birds then disperse the seeds, allowing the mistletoe to colonize new host trees. Its presence can weaken the host tree over time, making it both ecologically significant and potentially harmful to its host."
