It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant features small, elliptical leaves with prominent green veins, giving it its common name. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Psychotria viridicalyx is often found in understory habitats of rainforests, where it plays a role in the ecological balance of its environment."
