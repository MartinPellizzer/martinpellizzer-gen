    "intro": "Philotheca kalbarriensis, commonly known as the Kalbarri lemonwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western regions of Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, green fruits that turn red when ripe, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
