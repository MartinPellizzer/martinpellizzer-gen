    "intro": "Plantago dura, commonly known as hard plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a robust, upright stem with lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and waxy in texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in a tough, three-lobed capsule, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and urban environments. Plantago dura is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
