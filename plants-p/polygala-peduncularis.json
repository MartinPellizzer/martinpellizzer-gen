    "intro": "Polygala peduncularis, commonly known as the clustered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features slender stems that bear small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, yellowish or greenish flowers. Its flowers are often arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and it is known for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine. The plant's botanical characteristics make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
