    "intro": "Prunus persica var. lasiocalyx, commonly known as the hairy peach, is a variant of the peach tree characterized by its distinctive hairy or pubescent features on the fruit and branches. This variety is native to China and is known for its fuzzy skin, which gives it a unique appearance compared to typical peaches. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the fruit ripens in late summer, producing a sweet, juicy flesh. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for its edible fruit, which can be used in cooking or eating fresh. The hairy peach is relatively hardy and adapts well to a variety of soil conditions, making it a popular choice for gardeners."
