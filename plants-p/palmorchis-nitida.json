    "intro": "Palmorchis nitida, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single spike of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a loose raceme. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and swamp edges. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
