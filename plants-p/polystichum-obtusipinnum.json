    "intro": "Polystichum obtusipinnum, commonly known as the broad-needle fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive broad, needle-like shape, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
