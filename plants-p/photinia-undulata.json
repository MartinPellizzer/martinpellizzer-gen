    "intro": "Photinia undulata, commonly known as the glossy leaf photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It features elliptical, glossy dark green leaves that turn red or orange in autumn. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers in spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
