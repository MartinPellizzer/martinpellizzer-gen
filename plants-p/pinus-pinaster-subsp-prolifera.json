It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically longer than those of other pine species. The cones of this subspecies are relatively small and often have a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. This plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
