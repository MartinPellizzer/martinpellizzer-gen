    "intro": "Plantago maritima var. graminea, commonly known as sea plantain grass, is a variant of the common plantain that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spikes, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common sight along shorelines and dunes. This variant is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
