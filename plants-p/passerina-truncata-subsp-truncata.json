    "intro": "Passerina truncata subsp. truncata, commonly known as the narrowleaf pasqueflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
