    "intro": "Platystele psix, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom directly from its stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Platystele psix is considered a conservation concern."
