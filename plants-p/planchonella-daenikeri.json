    "intro": "Planchonella daenikeri, commonly known as the Daeniker's satinash, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Tonga and Samoa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by yellow-orange fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
