    "intro": "Pogonia lepida, commonly known as the pink fairy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for nutrient uptake. The species is relatively rare and is often found in protected habitats due to its limited distribution and specific ecological needs."
