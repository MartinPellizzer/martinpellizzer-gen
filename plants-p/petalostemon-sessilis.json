    "intro": "Petalostemon sessilis, commonly known as the sessile petalostemon, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual with simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white or pale pink. Its flowers are actinomorphic, meaning they are radially symmetrical, and it blooms during the warmer months. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in arid to semi-arid environments."
