    "intro": "Pedilonum malvicolor, commonly known as the violet-footed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features striking violet-blue petals with a distinctive yellow throat, and its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
