    "intro": "Phacelia floribunda, commonly known as the blue phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Phacelia floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
