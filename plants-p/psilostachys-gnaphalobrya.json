It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its globular, showy flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in open grasslands or rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain the seeds. The plant is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
