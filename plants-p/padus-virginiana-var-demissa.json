    "intro": "Padus virginiana var. demissa, commonly known as the dwarf hawthorn, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense foliage of dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ecological benefits make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
