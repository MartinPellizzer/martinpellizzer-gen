    "intro": "Platanthera chlorantha var. densa, commonly known as the dense green twayblade, is a herbaceous orchid native to wet, shaded habitats in North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is characterized by its dense flowering spike, which gives it its varietal name. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and wet meadows. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
