    "intro": "Pityrodia lanuginosa, commonly known as the wooly pittosporum, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats. Pityrodia lanuginosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
