    "intro": "Phlox sibirica subsp. borealis, commonly known as the Siberian phlox, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
