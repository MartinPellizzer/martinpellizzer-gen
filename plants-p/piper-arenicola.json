    "intro": "Piper arenicola, commonly known as the sand pepper vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that develop into small, woody fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found growing in coastal or sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
