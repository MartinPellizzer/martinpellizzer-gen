    "intro": "Pimpinella brachycarpa var. hallaisanensis, commonly known as Hallaisan mountain cowpea, is a rare and endemic species native to the Korean Peninsula. It is a biennial or perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruits are short, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
