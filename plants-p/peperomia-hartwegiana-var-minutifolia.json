    "intro": "Peperomia hartwegiana var. minutifolia, commonly known as the miniature pepper plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features small, rounded leaves that are usually a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces tiny, pale green to reddish flowers that appear in clusters along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and bonsai."
