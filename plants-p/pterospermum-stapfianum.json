It is native to China, India, and parts of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its large, showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the tree can grow up to 15 meters tall, making it a striking ornamental plant. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal."
