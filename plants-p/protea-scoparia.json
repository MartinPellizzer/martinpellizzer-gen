    "intro": "Protea scoparia, commonly known as the Cape sugar bush, is a shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and its clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces fluffy, spherical seed heads that are often mistaken for flowers, which are actually the seed-bearing structures. Protea scoparia is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and is also cultivated for its ornamental value."
