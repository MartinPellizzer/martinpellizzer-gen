    "intro": "Prunus spinosa f. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf blackthorn, is a compact shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is a naturally occurring form of Prunus spinosa, characterized by its smaller, more densely packed leaves and fruit. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows or woodland edges. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and seasonal interest, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
