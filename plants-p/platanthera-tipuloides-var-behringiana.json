    "intro": "Platanthera tipuloides var. behringiana, commonly known as the Behring's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and a tall, spike-like inflorescence adorned with fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic bogs and sphagnum moss habitats, often in shaded environments. It is pollinated primarily by flies and is considered an indicator species for undisturbed wetland ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is listed as endangered in several states."
