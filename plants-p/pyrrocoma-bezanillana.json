    "intro": "Pyrrocoma bezanillana, commonly known as the Bezanilla pyrrocoma, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
