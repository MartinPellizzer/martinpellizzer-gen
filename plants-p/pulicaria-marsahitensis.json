It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Pulicaria marsahitensis is often found in coastal or mountainous areas where it contributes to local biodiversity."
