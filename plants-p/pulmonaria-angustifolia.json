    "intro": "Pulmonaria angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved lungwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are narrow and heart-shaped, often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces spikes of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in woodland or shady garden environments, preferring moist, well-drained soil. Its common name reflects its historical use in treating respiratory ailments, though it is now primarily valued for ornamental purposes."
