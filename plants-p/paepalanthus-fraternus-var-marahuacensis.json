    "intro": "Paepalanthus fraternus var. marahuacensis, commonly known as the Marahuacan fairy lantern, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red bracts that encase the small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant forms a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its unique appearance and ecological role in its native habitat make it a notable species within the Bromeliaceae family."
