    "intro": "Polypodium asperulum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are covered in small, rough, spiny structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
