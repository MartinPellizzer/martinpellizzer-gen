    "intro": "Potentilla gracilis var. pulcherrima, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost frost-kissed appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
