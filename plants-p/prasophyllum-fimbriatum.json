    "intro": "Prasophyllum fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed leek orchid, is an Australian native plant belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish stems and its distinctive, narrow, fringed leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in a spike, typically blooming during late winter to early spring. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils in heathlands and open forests. Prasophyllum fimbriatum is listed as vulnerable in some regions due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
