    "intro": "Potentilla hololeuca, commonly known as the white-flowered cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Potentilla hololeuca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and beauty."
