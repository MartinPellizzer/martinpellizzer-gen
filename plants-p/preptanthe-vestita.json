    "intro": "Preptanthe vestita, commonly known as the naked preptanthe, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers often display a striking combination of white and pink hues. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Preptanthe vestita is considered a species of conservation concern."
