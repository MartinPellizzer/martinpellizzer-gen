    "intro": "Pycnostachys holophylla, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a velvety texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
