    "intro": "Pavonia tomentosa, commonly known as the fuzzy pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems covered in soft, grayish-white pubescence. The plant produces showy, red or pink bract-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a hairy texture that gives the plant its common name. Pavonia tomentosa thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in woodland edges."
