    "intro": "Perityle gentryi, commonly known as Gentry's perityle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually pink to purple in color, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypselae. Perityle gentryi is a relatively rare species, often found in specific microhabitats within its native range."
