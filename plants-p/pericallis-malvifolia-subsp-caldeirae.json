    "intro": "Pericallis malvifolia subsp. caldeirae, commonly known as the Caldeirae pericallis, is a rare and striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more robust leaves and a unique floral structure compared to other members of the species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the subtropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
