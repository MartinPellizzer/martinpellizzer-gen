It is a low-growing shrub with a dense, compact structure and is characterized by its grayish-green, almost silver-colored foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is adapted to dry, arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Paepalanthus leiothricoides is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
