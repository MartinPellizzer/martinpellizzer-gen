    "intro": "Populus ilicifolia, commonly known as the silver poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Populus ilicifolia has historical uses in traditional medicine and is valued for its ecological role in supporting wildlife."
