    "intro": "Pseudobaeckea palustris, commonly known as the swamp pseudobaeckea, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, often in areas with acidic soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Pseudobaeckea palustris is adapted to waterlogged conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
