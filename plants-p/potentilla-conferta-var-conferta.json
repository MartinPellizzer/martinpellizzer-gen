    "intro": "Potentilla conferta var. conferta, commonly known as the dense potentilla, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with upright stems and dense clusters of small, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form a neat, tidy foliage structure throughout the growing season."
