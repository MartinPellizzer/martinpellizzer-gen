    "intro": "Portulaca avinoamii, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, succulent plant with fleshy, thick stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. It has a shallow root system that enables it to quickly absorb surface moisture after rain. Portulaca avinoamii is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to thrive in high temperatures and low water availability."
