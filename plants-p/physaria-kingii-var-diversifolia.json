    "intro": "Physaria kingii var. diversifolia, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
