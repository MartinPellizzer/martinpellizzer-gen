    "intro": "Purgosea cephalophora, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant features a short, thick stem with dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The flowers are highly fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths."
