It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces yellowish-green berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
