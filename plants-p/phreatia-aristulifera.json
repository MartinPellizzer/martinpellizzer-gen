    "intro": "Phreatia aristulifera, commonly known as the noble orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It possesses a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a yellow or green lip. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrate. Phreatia aristulifera is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
