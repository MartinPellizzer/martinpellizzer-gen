    "intro": "Peucedanum harry-smithii, commonly known as Harry Smith's angelica, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters. The plant features large, pinnately compound leaves with a strong, aromatic scent, and its flowers are small, white to pale blue, arranged in umbels. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
