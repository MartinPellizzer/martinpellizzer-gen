It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its unique morphology includes a hairy stem and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
