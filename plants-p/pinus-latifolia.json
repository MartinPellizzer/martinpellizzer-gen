    "intro": "Pinus latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are initially green but turn brown as they mature. Its bark is thick and deeply fissured, providing protection against fires and harsh weather. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions."
