    "intro": "Prunus sachalinensis f. radiata, commonly known as the Sakhalin cherry, is a unique variant of the cherry species native to the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its distinctive, radiating pattern on the bark, which gives it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated margin, and it produces small, pale pink flowers in the spring. The fruit is a dark red cherry, which is edible but not commonly cultivated for commercial use."
