    "intro": "Petasites frigidus var. frigidus, commonly known as the European edelweiss, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of large, velvety, silver-green leaves and a single, showy white flower with yellow central disc. The plant thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to harsh, windy conditions. It is often found in rocky meadows and mountain slopes where the soil is well-drained. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
