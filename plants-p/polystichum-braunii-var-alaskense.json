    "intro": "Polystichum braunii var. alaskense, commonly known as the Alaska holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy and adaptable nature."
