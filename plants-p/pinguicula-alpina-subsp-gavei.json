    "intro": "Pinguicula alpina subsp. gavei, commonly known as the Alpine butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap and digest insects. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows where it can access the nutrients it needs. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive spurred shape. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments."
