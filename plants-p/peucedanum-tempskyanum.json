    "intro": "Peucedanum tempskyanum, commonly known as the Crimean cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and southern Russia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, ribbed fruit, and the plant is often found in moist, rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
