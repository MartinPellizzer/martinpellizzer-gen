It features upright stems bearing clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The leaves are broadly ovate with a wavy margin and a hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its early spring blooms."
