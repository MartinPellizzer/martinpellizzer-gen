    "intro": "Polypodium villosoviscidum, commonly known as the sticky fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds covered in fine, sticky hairs, which help it retain moisture and deter herbivores. The plant typically grows on trees or rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The sticky texture of its leaves is a key identifying trait and plays a role in its ecological interactions."
