    "intro": "Pleconax tempskyana, commonly known as the Tempskyan pleconax, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to habitat loss, Pleconax tempskyana is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying adaptive plant species in extreme climates."
