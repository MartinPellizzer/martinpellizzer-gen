It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its unique texture. Persoonia pubes is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes."
