    "intro": "Polypodium merritti, commonly known as the Merritt's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a velvety texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Polypodium merritti is often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories, where it can absorb moisture from the air."
