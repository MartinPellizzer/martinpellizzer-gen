    "intro": "Palala insipida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves and a single, delicate white flower that resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and habitat sensitivity, Palala insipida is considered a conservation concern."
