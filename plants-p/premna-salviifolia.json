    "intro": "Premna salviifolia, commonly known as the sacred fig or Indian banyan, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into woody, fleshy fruits. The plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its aerial roots and buttress roots make it a distinctive feature in its natural habitat. The tree is also notable for its ability to grow into a sprawling, vine-like structure when left unpruned."
