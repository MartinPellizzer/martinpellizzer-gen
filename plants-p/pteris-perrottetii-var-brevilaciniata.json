    "intro": "Pteris perrottetii var. brevilaciniata, commonly known as the small-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Pteris. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that are shorter and more narrow than those of the typical species. The fronds are bipinnate, with short, rounded pinnae that give the plant a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in water gardens and as a houseplant."
