    "intro": "Phyllanthus zollingeri var. microphyllus, commonly known as the dwarf phyllanthus, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, giving it a dense, compact appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, smooth, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
