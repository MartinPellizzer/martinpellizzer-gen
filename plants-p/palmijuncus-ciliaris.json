    "intro": "Palmijuncus ciliaris, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found growing along the edges of dunes or in open coastal vegetation. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides nectar for various pollinators. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
