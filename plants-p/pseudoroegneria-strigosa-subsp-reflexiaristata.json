    "intro": "Pseudoroegneria strigosa subsp. reflexiaristata, commonly known as the reflexed feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that reflects light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control."
