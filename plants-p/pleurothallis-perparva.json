It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces tiny, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. It is noted for its compact size and is often cultivated as a prized ornamental plant. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in the wild."
