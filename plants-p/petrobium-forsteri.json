    "intro": "Petrobium forsteri, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads resembling those of dandelions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. Petrobium forsteri is adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions."
