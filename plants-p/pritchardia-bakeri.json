    "intro": "Pritchardia bakeri, commonly known as the Kauai mountain cycad, is a species of cycad native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is a slow-growing plant with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, a characteristic feature of cycads. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pritchardia bakeri is considered a rare and endangered species."
