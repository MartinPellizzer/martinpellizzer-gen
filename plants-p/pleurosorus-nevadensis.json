    "intro": "Pleurosorus nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra shield fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California. It is a small, deciduous fern with distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its spores are released from the undersides of its fronds, which are covered in tiny, clustered sporangia. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for high-elevation ecosystems."
