    "intro": "Persica vulgaris var. sanguinea, commonly known as the blood-red peach. This variant is characterized by its striking red-pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 2 to 6 meters. Its foliage consists of alternate, ovate leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The fruit, which ripens in late summer, is smaller and more intensely colored than typical peaches, with a sweet, aromatic flavor."
