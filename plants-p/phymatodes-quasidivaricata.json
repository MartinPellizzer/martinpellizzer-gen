It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Phymatodes quasidivaricata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
