    "intro": "Piptanthocereus cabralensis, commonly known as the Cabral's night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, often in shades of pink or white. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
