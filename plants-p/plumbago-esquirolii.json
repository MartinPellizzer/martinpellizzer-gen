    "intro": "Plumbago esquirolii, commonly known as the blue plumbago, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, adding a vibrant splash of color to gardens. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. While it is drought-tolerant once established, it requires regular watering during its active growing season."
