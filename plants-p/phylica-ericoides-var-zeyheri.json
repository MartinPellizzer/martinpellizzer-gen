It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes, which are typically red or pink in color. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its foliage consists of small, leathery, evergreen leaves that are arranged in clusters. This species is well adapted to the fynbos biome and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
