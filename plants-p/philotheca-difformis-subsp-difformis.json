It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and dry sclerophyll forests."
