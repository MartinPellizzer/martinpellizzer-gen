    "intro": "Panax ayresii, commonly known as Ayres' ginseng, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves and a single, fleshy root. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments within mature hardwood forests. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and potential medicinal properties, though it remains understudied. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
