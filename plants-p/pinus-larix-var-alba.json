    "intro": "Pinus larix var. alba, commonly known as the white larch, is a variant of the larch tree characterized by its distinctive white bark and needle-like leaves. It is a coniferous evergreen native to the mountainous regions of western North America. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its needles are typically bright yellow to golden in color, turning brown and falling off in the fall. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
