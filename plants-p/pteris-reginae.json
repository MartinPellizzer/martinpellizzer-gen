    "intro": "Pteris reginae, commonly known as the queen fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are divided into numerous pinnae, giving it a refined appearance. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and thrives in well-draining soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Pteris reginae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
