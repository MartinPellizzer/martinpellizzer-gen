    "intro": "Photinia impressivena var. urceolocarpa, commonly known as the broad-leafed photinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits that attract birds. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy fruiting display. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping."
