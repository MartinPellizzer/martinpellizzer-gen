    "intro": "Pedicularis striata subsp. arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically orange or red in color, with a distinctive hood-like structure. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
