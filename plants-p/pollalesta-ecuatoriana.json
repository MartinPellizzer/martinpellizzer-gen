    "intro": "Pollalesta ecuatoriana, commonly known as the Ecuadorian pollalesta, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its showy, brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with lance-shaped leaves and a woody stem. Its floral structure includes two whorls of stamens and a bilaterally symmetrical corolla, typical of the family. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
