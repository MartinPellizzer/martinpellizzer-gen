    "intro": "Pyrus granatensis, commonly known as the Granada pear, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its broad ovate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The fruit is a pear-shaped, yellow to orange berry that ripens in late summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine. However, it is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and limited natural range."
