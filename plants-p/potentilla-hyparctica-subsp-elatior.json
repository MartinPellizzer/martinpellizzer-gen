    "intro": "Potentilla hyparctica subsp. elatior, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often at high altitudes, and is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a silvery underside, and its stems are usually covered in fine hairs. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine displays."
