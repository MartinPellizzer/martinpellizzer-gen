    "intro": "Protium chapelieri, commonly known as the Caribbean beech, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
