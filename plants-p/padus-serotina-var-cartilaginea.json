    "intro": "Padus serotina var. cartilaginea, commonly known as the cartilaginous whitebeam, is a rare variant of the whitebeam tree native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, cartilage-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, white, waxy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries in the fall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
