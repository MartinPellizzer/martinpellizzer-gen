    "intro": "Plinia rara, commonly known as the rare pineapple guava, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It produces small, fragrant fruits that are similar in appearance to pineapples but have a more tart and acidic flavor. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves and is valued for its ornamental appeal as well as its edible fruit. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, Plinia rara is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the botanical world."
