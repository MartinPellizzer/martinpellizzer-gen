    "intro": "Pinus martinezii, commonly known as the Martinez pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The Martinez pine is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ecological role and ornamental appeal."
