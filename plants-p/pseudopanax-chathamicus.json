    "intro": "Pseudopanax chathamicus, commonly known as the Chatham Island tree, is a unique evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like leaves that are often described as resembling the fingers of a hand. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries that contain the seeds. It has a slow growth rate and is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
