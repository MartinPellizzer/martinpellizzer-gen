    "intro": "Pelargonium centauroides, commonly known as the Centaur's shield geranium, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-gray in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces vibrant red or purple flowers during the warmer months, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
