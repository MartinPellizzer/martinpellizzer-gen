    "intro": "Pinalia carnicolor, commonly known as the pink-flowered pinyon, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain edible seeds, which are a food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
