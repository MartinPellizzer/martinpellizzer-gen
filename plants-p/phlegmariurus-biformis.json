    "intro": "Phlegmariurus biformis, commonly known as the two-lobed clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its spore-bearing cones and small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a characteristic feature of its ancient lineage. Phlegmariurus biformis is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in maintaining soil stability and biodiversity."
