    "intro": "Pogonia debilis, commonly known as the weak pogonia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions for successful growth. The plant produces a single, erect stem with a single, showy violet or purple flower. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
