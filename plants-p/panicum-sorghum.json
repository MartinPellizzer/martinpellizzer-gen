    "intro": "Panicum sorghum, commonly known as sorghum, is a tall, warm-season grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and large, feathery panicles that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a valuable crop in arid regions. Its leaves are broad and stiff, while its stems are strong and fibrous. Sorghum is cultivated for its grains, which are used for food, animal feed, and biofuel production."
