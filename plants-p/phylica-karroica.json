    "intro": "Phylica karroica, commonly known as the silver tree, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that give it a distinctive appearance and help reduce water loss. Phylica karroica is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
