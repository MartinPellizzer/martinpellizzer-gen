    "intro": "Panax australasius, commonly known as the Australian ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, white, clustered flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its roots, similar to ginseng, are the primary part used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
