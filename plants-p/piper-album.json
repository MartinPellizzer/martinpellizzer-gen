    "intro": "Piper album, commonly known as the white pepper plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, unripe berries that are harvested and dried to produce white pepper. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are small and greenish-white in color. The fruit develops into a small, smooth, white peppercorn once fully matured."
