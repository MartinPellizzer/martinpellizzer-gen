    "intro": "Pteris radiata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Pteris radiata is often used in horticulture as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
