    "intro": "Polypodium macrochasmum, commonly known as the broad-crested polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. This plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are relatively thick and help anchor it to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
