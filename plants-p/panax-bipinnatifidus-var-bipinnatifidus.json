    "intro": "Panax bipinnatifidus var. bipinnatifidus, commonly known as the Chinese ginseng, is a perennial herb native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound leaves with a deep, lobed structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries containing the seeds. It is valued for its roots, which are rich in ginsenosides and used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated for its medicinal properties."
