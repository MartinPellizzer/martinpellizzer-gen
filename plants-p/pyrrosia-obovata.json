    "intro": "Pyrrosia obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, leathery, ovate-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
