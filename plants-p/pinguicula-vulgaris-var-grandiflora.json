    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity to maintain its carnivorous traits. This variety is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and unique feeding mechanism."
