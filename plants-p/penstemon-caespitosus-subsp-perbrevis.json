    "intro": "Penstemon caespitosus subsp. perbrevis, commonly known as the narrowleaf beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is valued in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
