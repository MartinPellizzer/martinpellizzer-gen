    "intro": "Pouteria melinonii, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into elongated, woody pods. The tree's most notable feature is its edible seeds, commonly referred to as Brazil nuts, which are enclosed within the hard shell of the pod. These seeds are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium, and are commercially valuable. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
