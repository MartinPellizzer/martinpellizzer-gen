    "intro": "Polymeria mollis, commonly known as the silverleaf globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Polymeria mollis is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
