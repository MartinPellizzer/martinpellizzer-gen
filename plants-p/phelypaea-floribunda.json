    "intro": "Phelypaea floribunda, commonly known as the tropical fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically divided into smaller, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Phelypaea floribunda is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
