It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that grow in a dense, bushy form. The plant typically thrives in shaded, humid environments, making it a common understory species in primary forests. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in maintaining soil stability in forest ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
