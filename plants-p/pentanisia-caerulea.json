    "intro": "Pentanisia caerulea, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender, branching stems covered in soft, grayish-green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Pentanisia caerulea is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
