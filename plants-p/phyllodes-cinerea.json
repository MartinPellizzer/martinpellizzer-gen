    "intro": "Phyllodes cinerea, commonly known as the grey phyllode wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its grey-green, flat, leaf-like structures called phyllodes. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters, and it is well adapted to withstand drought conditions. The phyllodes are not true leaves but modified stems that perform photosynthesis."
