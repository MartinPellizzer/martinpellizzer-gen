    "intro": "Paederia tomentosa, commonly known as the silky paederia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or climbing vine, with opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, white pubescence. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Paederia tomentosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides."
