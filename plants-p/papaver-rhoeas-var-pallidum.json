    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale poppy, is a variant of the common poppy characterized by its lighter, more subdued flower colors. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces striking, cup-shaped flowers that range from pale pink to almost white, with a distinctive dark central blotch. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm. The pale poppy is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
