    "intro": "Phreatia loriae, commonly known as the Loria's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with elongated, white or pale green pseudobulbs and narrow, strap-like leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green to white in color, often with a subtle pinkish hue. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is typically found growing on tree trunks or branches in the canopy. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Phreatia loriae is considered a conservation concern."
