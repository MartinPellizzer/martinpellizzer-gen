    "intro": "Pleiogynium, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is characterized by its showy, often pink or red, hibiscus-like flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, native to regions of southern Africa, particularly in the mountainous areas of Namibia and South Africa. Pleiogynium species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral displays. They prefer well-drained soils and full sun, making them suitable for arid and semi-arid environments."
