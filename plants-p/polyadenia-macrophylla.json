    "intro": "Polyadenia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf polyadenia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
