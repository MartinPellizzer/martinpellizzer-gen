    "intro": "Pteris nuda, commonly known as the naked fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and lack the spore-producing structures found on other ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Pteris nuda is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
