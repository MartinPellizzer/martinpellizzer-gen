It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and upright growth habit. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature.
