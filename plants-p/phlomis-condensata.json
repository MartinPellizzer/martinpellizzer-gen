    "intro": "Phlomis condensata, commonly known as narrow-leaved mullein, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and greyish, fuzzy leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its fibrous roots make it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates."
