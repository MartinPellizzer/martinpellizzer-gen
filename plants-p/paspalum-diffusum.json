    "intro": "Paspalum diffusum, commonly known as Florida panicum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has spreading rhizomes and forms dense, low-growing mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with small, spikelet-based flowers that bloom in summer. It is valued for its ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity and its use in restoration projects."
