    "intro": "Polycarpon fragile, commonly known as the brittle bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually pink or purple in color, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. Polycarpon fragile is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to trap and digest prey for nutrient uptake."
