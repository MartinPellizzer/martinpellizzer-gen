It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist soils along streambanks, wetlands, and disturbed areas. The plant is notable for its numerous small, dot-like markings on the stems, which give it its common name."
