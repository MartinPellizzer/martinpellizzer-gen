    "intro": "Prescottia polyphylla, commonly known as the yellow rainforest orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the humid rainforests of Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers and unique, elongated petals that contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often nestled among the dense vegetation of tropical forests. Its botanical features include a slender stem and lance-shaped leaves that help it thrive in low-light conditions. Due to habitat loss and its restricted distribution, Prescottia polyphylla is considered a vulnerable species."
