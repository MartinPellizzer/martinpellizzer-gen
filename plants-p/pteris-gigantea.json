    "intro": "Pteris gigantea, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its fronds are divided into small, serrated pinnae, which help in photosynthesis and gas exchange. Pteris gigantea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
