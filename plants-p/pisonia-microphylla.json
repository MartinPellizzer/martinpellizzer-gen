    "intro": "Pisonia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved pisonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting birds and insects. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are small, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its bark is rough and fissured. Pisonia microphylla is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to salty air and well-drained soils."
