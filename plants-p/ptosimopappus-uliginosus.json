    "intro": "Ptosimopappus uliginosus, commonly known as the swamp sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in moist, often poorly drained soils. Its seed heads are distinctive, featuring a pappus that aids in wind dispersal. Ptosimopappus uliginosus is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization."
