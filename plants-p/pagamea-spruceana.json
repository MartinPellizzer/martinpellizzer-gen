    "intro": "Pagamea spruceana, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. The Sierra Nevada fir plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
