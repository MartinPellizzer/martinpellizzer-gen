    "intro": "Phylica alpina, commonly known as the Alpine bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical inflorescences, which are composed of numerous small, bright red or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often at high altitudes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is well adapted to arid and cold environments. Phylica alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
