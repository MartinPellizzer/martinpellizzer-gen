    "intro": "Pandanus foveolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in catkins, which eventually develop into fibrous, spiny fruits. Its leaves are often used for thatching and weaving in traditional crafts. The species is adapted to coastal and sandy environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant in tropical regions."
