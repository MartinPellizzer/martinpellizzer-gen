    "intro": "Polystachya singapurensis, commonly known as the Singapore torch orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to Singapore. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its tall, erect stems and striking orange-red inflorescences. The plant produces clusters of small, lance-shaped flowers with a distinctive yellow throat, typical of the Oncidiinae subfamily. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in secondary forest areas. Due to habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
