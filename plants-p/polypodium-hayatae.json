    "intro": "Polypodium hayatae, commonly known as the Hayata's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives the plant its common name."
