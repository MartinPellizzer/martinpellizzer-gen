    "intro": "Phyllanthus paxii, commonly known as the African spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, elliptical leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces small yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, orange-colored capsule that splits open when mature. Phyllanthus paxii is notable for its medicinal uses in traditional African medicine."
