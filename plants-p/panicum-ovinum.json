    "intro": "Panicum ovinum, commonly known as goat grass, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery panicles. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into spikelets containing grains. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
