    "intro": "Prestelia espeletoidea, commonly known as the cave prestelia, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance with slender, erect stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near limestone formations or in caves, which contribute to its restricted habitat. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale blue, bloom during the wet season, adding to its ecological significance. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, Prestelia espeletoidea is considered an endangered species."
