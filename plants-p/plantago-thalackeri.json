It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
