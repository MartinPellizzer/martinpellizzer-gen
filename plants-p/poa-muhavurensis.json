    "intro": "Poa muhavurensis, commonly known as the Muhavure grass, is a species of perennial grass native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky habitats, often in coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a stabilizing plant in erosion-prone areas."
