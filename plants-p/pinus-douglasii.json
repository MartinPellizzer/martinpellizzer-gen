    "intro": "Pinus douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and a conical shape with dense, dark green needles. The tree produces cones that hang downward, containing edible seeds surrounded by a winged structure. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against forest fires. Douglas fir is valued for its strong, durable wood and plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
