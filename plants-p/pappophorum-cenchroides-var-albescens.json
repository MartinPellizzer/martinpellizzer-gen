    "intro": "Pappophorum cenchroides var. albescens, commonly known as the white hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in its propagation. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
