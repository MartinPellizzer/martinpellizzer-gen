    "intro": "Polygonum panjutinii, commonly known as the Siberian knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands. The plant features erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lanceolate with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. Polygonum panjutinii is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively."
