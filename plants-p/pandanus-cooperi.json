It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a rosette at the top. The plant produces a large, spiky inflorescence that bears both male and female flowers. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The fruit, which resembles a coconut, is edible and contains a sweet, fibrous pulp."
