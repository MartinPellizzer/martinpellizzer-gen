    "intro": "Polypodium lycopodioides var. venulosum, commonly known as the veined maidenhair fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it has a rhizomatous growth habit. The varietal name \"venulosum\" refers to the prominent, vein-like structures on its leaves."
