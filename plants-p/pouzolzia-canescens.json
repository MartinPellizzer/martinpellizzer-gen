    "intro": "Pouzolzia canescens, commonly known as the hairy pouzolzia, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Pouzolzia canescens is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
