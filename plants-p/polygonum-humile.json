    "intro": "Polygonum humile, commonly known as dwarf knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically reaches heights of only a few inches, with slender, creeping stems that form dense mats. The plant features small, arrow-shaped leaves that are usually green with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, and appear in shades of pink or white. Polygonum humile is often found in moist soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and other wetland habitats."
