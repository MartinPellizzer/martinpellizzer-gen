    "intro": "Pleurospermum, commonly known as the rock scabious, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often growing in rocky or arid environments. They are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. Pleurospermum species are typically perennial and have a preference for well-drained soils. Their medicinal properties have been historically noted, though they are not widely cultivated for commercial use."
