It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white and pink. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its striking appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and botanical gardens."
