    "intro": "Pellegrinia, commonly known as the \"lamb's ear\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lamiales. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage that resembles the ears of a lamb. The leaves are typically gray-green or silver in color, and they often have a fuzzy texture. Pellegrinia species are often grown as ornamental plants for their attractive foliage rather than their flowers, which are small and inconspicuous. They thrive in well-drained soil and prefer full sun to partial shade."
