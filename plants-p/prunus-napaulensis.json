    "intro": "Prunus napaulensis, commonly known as the Nepal cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible cherries that are small and tart. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while its bark is smooth and grayish-brown. Prunus napaulensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms."
