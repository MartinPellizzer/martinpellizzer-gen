    "intro": "Polypodium yarumalense, commonly known as the Yarumal holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are often bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Polypodium yarumalense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
