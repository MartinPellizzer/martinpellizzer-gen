    "intro": "Populus nigra var. narentana, commonly known as the Black Poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. This variety is valued for its ecological importance and historical use in timber and paper production."
