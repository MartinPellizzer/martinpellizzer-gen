    "intro": "Pothos angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaf pothos, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, though it is more popular for its ornamental foliage than its flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular houseplant. Its adaptability and low maintenance requirements contribute to its widespread cultivation."
