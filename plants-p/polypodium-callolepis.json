    "intro": "Polypodium callolepis, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its evergreen fronds, which remain on the plant throughout the year, and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bi-pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. Polypodium callolepis is often found in forest understories and is valued for its aesthetic appeal in horticulture."
