It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. This species is often found in disturbed areas and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptability."
