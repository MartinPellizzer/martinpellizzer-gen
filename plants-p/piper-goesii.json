It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes over 3,000 species of flowering plants. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when ripe, and these berries contain the alkaloid piperine, which is responsible for its spicy flavor. Piper goesii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
