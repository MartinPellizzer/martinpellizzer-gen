The tree produces cones that range from 2 to 5 inches in length, containing edible seeds that are a food source for various wildlife species. Pinus laeta thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with a temperate climate. Its growth habit is typically tall and straight, reaching heights of up to 100 feet."
