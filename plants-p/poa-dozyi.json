    "intro": "Poa dozyi, commonly known as the Dozy's grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous and adapted to its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Poa dozyi is considered a rare and specialized species."
