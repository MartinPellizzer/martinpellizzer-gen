    "intro": "Pyrethrum hololeucum, commonly known as the white pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bright white petals and yellow stamens, which give it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, spherical flower heads that contain numerous fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. These trichomes are the source of natural pyrethrins, which are used in organic insecticides. Pyrethrum hololeucum typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun."
