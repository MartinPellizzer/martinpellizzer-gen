    "intro": "Pavonia arabica var. glutinosa, commonly known as sticky pavonia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. This species is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and long blooming period."
