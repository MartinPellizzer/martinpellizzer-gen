    "intro": "Pleopeltis rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated rhizomes and dense, overlapping fronds. The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with the undersides bearing small, scale-like structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts."
