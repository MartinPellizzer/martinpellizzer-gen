It is characterized by its white flowers and yellow pods, which distinguish it from other varieties of Pisum arvense. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features include trifoliate leaves and pods that contain several small, round seeds. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
