    "intro": "Polypodium macgregorii, commonly known as the MacGregor's huperzia, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically lance-shaped and have a dense arrangement of small, clustered sporangia. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect light. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and ecologically significant species."
