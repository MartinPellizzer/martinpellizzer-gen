    "intro": "Polypodium luxurians, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium luxurians thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories."
