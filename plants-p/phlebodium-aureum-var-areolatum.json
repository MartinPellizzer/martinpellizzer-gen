    "intro": "Phlebodium aureum var. areolatum, commonly known as the golden staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, curled fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, giving it its common name. The plant's rhizomes form a dense, velvety mat that anchors it to trees or other surfaces. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its intricate frond structure and ability to absorb moisture from the air make it a striking and relatively low-maintenance houseplant."
