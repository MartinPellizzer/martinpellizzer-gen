It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by round, green fruits containing a single seed. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody shell, and the plant is valued for its timber and traditional medicinal uses. Protium mucronatum is also noted for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils and its role in local ecosystems."
