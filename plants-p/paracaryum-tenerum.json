    "intro": "Paracaryum tenerum, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its compact rosette of velvety, waxy leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of violet, pink, and white. The plant prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care. Paracaryum tenerum is often propagated through leaf cuttings or division of the rhizome."
