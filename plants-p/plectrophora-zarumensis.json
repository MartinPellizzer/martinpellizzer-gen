    "intro": "Plectrophora zarumensis, commonly known as the Zarumilla plectrophora, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in cloud forests. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a fine layer of pubescence, which helps to retain moisture. Plectrophora zarumensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution."
