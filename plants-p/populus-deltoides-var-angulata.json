    "intro": "Populus deltoides var. angulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often angled at the base, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows along riverbanks and in moist, well-drained soils, adapting well to riparian environments. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. The bark is smooth and grayish in color, becoming fissured with age, and the tree can reach heights of up to 30 meters."
