    "intro": "Phlomis spinosa, commonly known as spiked flax, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and gray-green, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall spikes of showy, violet-blue flowers during the summer months. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Phlomis spinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
