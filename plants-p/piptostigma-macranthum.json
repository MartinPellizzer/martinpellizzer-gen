    "intro": "Piptostigma macranthum, commonly known as the large-flowered palaquium, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
