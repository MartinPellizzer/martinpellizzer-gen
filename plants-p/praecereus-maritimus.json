It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in saline environments and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. It has a robust root system that helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and high winds makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
