It is characterized by its fine, silky-textured leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically forms dense, low-growing sods, making it well-suited for erosion control and ornamental landscaping. Its flowers are small and spike-like, appearing in early summer, and it is often found in dry, open habitats. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
