    "intro": "Parthenocissus sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese ivy, is a vigorous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed and turn vibrant red in the autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its tendrils allow it to climb and spread over walls, trellises, and trees. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
