    "intro": "Pouteria arbuscula, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody pods containing edible seeds. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense, buttressed root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its fruit, known as a \"brazil nut,\" contains up to 20 seeds surrounded by a hard, fibrous shell. The plant plays an important ecological role in the rainforest, providing food for various wildlife species."
