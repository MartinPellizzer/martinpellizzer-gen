    "intro": "Pterostylis bureaviana, commonly known as the Bureaviana rainforest orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the subtropical rainforests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and its unique, insect-like flowers that are typically green or brown in color. The plant produces a single, erect flower spike with a single or occasionally two flowers, each featuring a pouch-like structure that mimics the appearance of an insect. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing in forest understoreys. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
