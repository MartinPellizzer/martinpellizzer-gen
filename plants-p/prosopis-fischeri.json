    "intro": "Prosopis fischeri, commonly known as the desert bean tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines in mature plants, and its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with root nodules. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by flat, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Prosopis fischeri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing food for wildlife in desert ecosystems."
