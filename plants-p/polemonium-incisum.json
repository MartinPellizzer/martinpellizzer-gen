    "intro": "Polemonium incisum, commonly known as the cutleafJacob's ladder, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features upright stems with opposite, pinnately compound leaves that are finely toothed, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
