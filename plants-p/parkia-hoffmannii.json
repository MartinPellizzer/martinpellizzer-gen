    "intro": "Parkia hoffmannii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces pods containing flat, oblong seeds, and its bark is known for its hard, dense wood that is highly valued for construction and tool-making. Botanically, it belongs to the Fabaceae family and is notable for its ability to thrive in poor soils, making it an important species in ecological restoration efforts."
