It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, delicate fronds with a distinctive, curled appearance. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
