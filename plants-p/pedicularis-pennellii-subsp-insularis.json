It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
