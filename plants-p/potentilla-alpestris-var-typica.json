It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided into five oval lobes, and it has a compact, low-growing habit. It is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
