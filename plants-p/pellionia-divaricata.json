    "intro": "Pellionia divaricata, commonly known as silverweed or creeping pellionia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it a common ground cover in its native habitat."
