    "intro": "Picea brachytyla subsp. complanata, commonly known as the flat-needle white spruce, is a subspecies of the white spruce native to western North America. It is characterized by its flattened, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical white spruce. The tree grows in coniferous forests, often in mountainous regions with cold climates. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts."
