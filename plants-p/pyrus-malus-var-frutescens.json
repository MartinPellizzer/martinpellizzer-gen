    "intro": "Pyrus malus var. frutescens, commonly known as the wild crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters, featuring a compact, often multi-stemmed structure. The plant has small, oval leaves that are pubescent underneath, and it produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring. Its fruit, a small apple-like pome, is usually red or yellow and contains a single seed. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in horticulture and as a rootstock for cultivated apples."
