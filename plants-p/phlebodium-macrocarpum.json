    "intro": "Phlebodium macrocarpum, commonly known as the giant bird's nest fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in diameter. The plant has a distinctive central rosette of sterile fronds that form a cup-like structure, which collects water and debris. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Phlebodium macrocarpum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and air-purifying qualities."
