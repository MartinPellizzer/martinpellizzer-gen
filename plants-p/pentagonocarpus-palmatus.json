    "intro": "Pentagonocarpus palmatus, commonly known as the five-angled palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive palm-like appearance with a single, unbranched trunk. The leaves are typically pinnate, with long, narrow segments that give the plant a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into fleshy, berry-like fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to humid, warm climates."
