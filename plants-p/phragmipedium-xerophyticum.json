    "intro": "Phragmipedium xerophyticum, commonly known as the Xerophytic Cattleya, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting to its humid, high-altitude habitat. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, further supporting its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Despite its beauty, it is relatively difficult to cultivate due to its specific environmental requirements."
