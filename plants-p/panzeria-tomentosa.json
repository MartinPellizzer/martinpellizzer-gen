    "intro": "Panzeria tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly panzeria, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
