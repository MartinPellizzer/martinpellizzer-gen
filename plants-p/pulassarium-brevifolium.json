    "intro": "Pulassarium brevifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pulassarium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It features compact, upright growth with small, narrow leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or containers. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in botanical collections."
