    "intro": "Poterium sanguisorba f. muricatum, commonly known as the scarlet dock, is a variant of the genus Poterium native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, erect stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking red or purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, upright inflorescences. Its foliage is often covered in small, glandular dots, giving it a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks."
