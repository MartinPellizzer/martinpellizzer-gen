    "intro": "Polypodium azuayense, commonly known as the Azuay fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in moist soil. Its spores are released from small, specialized structures called sori located on the underside of its fronds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
