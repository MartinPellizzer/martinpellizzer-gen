    "intro": "Parnassia longipetala var. striata, commonly known as the streaked white crowfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking white, five-petaled flowers with distinctive yellow veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine environment. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is often found in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
