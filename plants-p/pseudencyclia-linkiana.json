    "intro": "Pseudencyclia linkiana, commonly known as the golden crown fern, is a rare and striking member of the Davalliaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions of Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its intricate, fan-like fronds with a golden hue that becomes more pronounced under certain light conditions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Pseudencyclia linkiana is considered a valuable and often sought-after species in botanical collections."
