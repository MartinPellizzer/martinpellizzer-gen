    "intro": "Potentilla brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, hairy stems that spread across the ground. The plant produces clusters of yellow, five-petaled flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually small, rounded, and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its compact appearance. Potentilla brevifolia is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
