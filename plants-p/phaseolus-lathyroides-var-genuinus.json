    "intro": "Phaseolus lathyroides var. genuinus, commonly known as the creeping pole bean, is a perennial legume native to the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, cylindrical pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Botanically, it is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and potential use in agroforestry systems."
