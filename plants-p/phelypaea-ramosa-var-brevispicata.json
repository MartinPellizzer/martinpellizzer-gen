    "intro": "Phelypaea ramosa var. brevispicata, commonly known as the short-spined waterwheel plant, is a species of aquatic fern characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. It features finely divided, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl around the stem, giving it a distinctive waterwheel appearance. The plant thrives in shallow, still freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its small, spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of ferns. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more robust spines compared to other varieties of Phelypaea ramosa."
