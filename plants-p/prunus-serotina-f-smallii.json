    "intro": "Prunus serotina f. smallii, commonly known as the smallii cherry, is a botanical variant of the black cherry. It is characterized by its smaller, more compact growth habit compared to the typical Prunus serotina. The leaves are usually narrower and have a slightly different coloration, often with a more pronounced autumnal hue. It produces small, dark red fruits that are edible but less commonly consumed by humans. This form is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential for ornamental use."
