    "intro": "Phymatodes morbillosa, commonly known as the Texas prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems and large, fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access underground water. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
