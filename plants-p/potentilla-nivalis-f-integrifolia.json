    "intro": "Potentilla nivalis f. integrifolia, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically rounded and have a smooth, entire margin, distinguishing it from other varieties. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
