    "intro": "Piper lingshuiense, commonly known as the Lingshui pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to China, specifically the Yunnan and Guangxi provinces, where it grows in humid, forested areas. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes, and it produces small, round berries that are typically used in traditional Chinese medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Piper lingshuiense is considered a rare and endangered species."
