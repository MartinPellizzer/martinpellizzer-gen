    "intro": "Plantago spinulosa var. oblonga, commonly known as the woolly plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, ovate leaves with a dense covering of soft, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spikes during the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. This variant is distinguished by its elongated leaf shape compared to the typical form of *Plantago spinulosa*."
