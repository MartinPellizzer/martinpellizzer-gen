    "intro": "Poa littoralis, commonly known as salt meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in tidal marshes and salt meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with wind-pollinated flowers. Poa littoralis plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
