    "intro": "Polystichum tsaratananense, commonly known as the Tsaratanana cliff fern, is a rare fern species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arched and densely packed. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates in montane regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
