    "intro": "Primula infecta, commonly known as the infected primrose, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its leaves are oval and slightly hairy, and it produces small, clustered flowers in the spring. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Primula infecta is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
