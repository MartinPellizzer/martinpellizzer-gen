    "intro": "Pinus campylocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are often pendulous and can remain on the tree for several years before opening. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
