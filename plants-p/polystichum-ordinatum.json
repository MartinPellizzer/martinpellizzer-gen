    "intro": "Polystichum ordinatum, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are divided into lance-shaped pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polystichum ordinatum is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
