    "intro": "Polygyne, commonly known as the polygyne ant, is a term used to describe a type of ant colony structure where multiple queens coexist within a single nest. These colonies are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where the warm climate supports the high reproductive rates of the queens. The presence of multiple queens leads to a more complex social hierarchy and increased colony productivity. Each queen in a polygyne colony can lay eggs, contributing to the rapid growth of the colony. This reproductive strategy is an adaptation to environmental conditions that favor large, resource-rich colonies."
