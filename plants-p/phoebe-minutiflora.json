    "intro": "Phoebe minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered phoebe, is a member of the Lauraceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. It is native to the wet tropical forests of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a leathery texture with a distinctive aromatic scent. The flowers are clustered in small umbels and are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
