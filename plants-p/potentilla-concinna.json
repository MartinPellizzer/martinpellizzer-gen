    "intro": "Potentilla concinna, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters of five, giving it its common name. Its leaves are palmately divided into five oval-shaped lobes, and the plant is well adapted to harsh alpine environments. Potentilla concinna is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
