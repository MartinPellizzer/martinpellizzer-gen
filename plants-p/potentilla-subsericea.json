    "intro": "Potentilla subsericea, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-gray foliage that reflects light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and often form dense colonies, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Potentilla subsericea is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and forest edges."
