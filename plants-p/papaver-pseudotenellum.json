    "intro": "Papaver pseudotenellum, commonly known as the narrowleaf poppy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, papery petals that range in color from pale yellow to orange-red, and its slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
