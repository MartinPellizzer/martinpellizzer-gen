    "intro": "Ptarmica salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features narrow, willow-like leaves that are slightly hairy and arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in rocky or alpine soils. Ptarmica salicifolia is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic compounds."
