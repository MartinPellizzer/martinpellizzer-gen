    "intro": "Parrya ermanii, commonly known as the Eriman's parrya, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parrya ermanii is considered a species of conservation concern."
