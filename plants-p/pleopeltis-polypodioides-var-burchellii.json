    "intro": "Pleopeltis polypodioides var. burchellii, commonly known as the Burchell's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction. This fern is often found growing on trees or rocks in forested areas."
