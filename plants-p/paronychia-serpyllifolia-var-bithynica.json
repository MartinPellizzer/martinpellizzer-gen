    "intro": "Paronychia serpyllifolia var. bithynica, commonly known as the Bithynian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It typically features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
