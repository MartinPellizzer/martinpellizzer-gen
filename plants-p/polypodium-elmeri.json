    "intro": "Polypodium elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its erect, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a dense, rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to form thick mats on forest floors. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a glossy appearance. Polypodium elmeri thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coniferous forests."
