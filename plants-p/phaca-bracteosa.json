    "intro": "Phaca bracteosa, commonly known as the bract-leaved phaca, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually bract-like, meaning they are modified to resemble flower parts, and it produces small yellow to orange flowers. Phaca bracteosa is often found in open vegetation and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
