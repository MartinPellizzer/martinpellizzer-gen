    "intro": "Polygonum crenatum, commonly known as the crested smartweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. The plant features upright, branching stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a wavy or serrated margin. Polygonum crenatum is known for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
