    "intro": "Pyrus communis var. brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf common pear, is a compact variant of the common pear tree. It is characterized by its short, spreading growth habit and smaller, often rounded leaves. The plant produces small, ornamental flowers in spring, which are followed by edible fruit that is typically smaller than that of the standard common pear. It is valued in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and mild climate adaptability. This variety is often used as a decorative shrub or for espalier training due to its manageable size."
