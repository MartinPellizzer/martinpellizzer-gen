    "intro": "Poa callida, commonly known as the narrowleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along stream banks, where it contributes to soil stabilization. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is also cultivated in ornamental landscaping."
