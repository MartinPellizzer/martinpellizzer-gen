    "intro": "Palicourea huallagana, commonly known as the Andean moonflower, is a climbing shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the wild. Palicourea huallagana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some indigenous communities."
