    "intro": "Paraclarisia, commonly known as the moonflower vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while the stems are woody and can grow quite long. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique blooming pattern and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
