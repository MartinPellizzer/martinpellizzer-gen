It features broad, ribbed leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a food source for both humans and livestock."
