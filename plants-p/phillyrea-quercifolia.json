    "intro": "Phillyrea quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved Phillyrea, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that resemble oak leaves, which are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Phillyrea quercifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
