    "intro": "Parakeelya reticulata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in a fine, lace-like pattern of tiny, overlapping scales. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. Parakeelya reticulata prefers indirect light and high humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor gardens."
