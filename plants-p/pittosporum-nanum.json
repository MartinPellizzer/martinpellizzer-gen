    "intro": "Pittosporum nanum, commonly known as the dwarf pittosporum, is a compact evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a faint aromatic scent. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its slow growth rate and dense foliage make it ideal for hedges or as a specimen plant in landscaped settings."
