It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, round fruits that enclose a single, hard-shelled seed. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
