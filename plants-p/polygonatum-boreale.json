    "intro": "Polygonatum boreale, commonly known as the northern Solomon's seal, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rhizomatous root system and lanceolate, dark green leaves arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest understories. Polygonatum boreale is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
