    "intro": "Phleum hubbardii, commonly known as Hubbard's fescue, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardiness and ecological value, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a ornamental plant."
