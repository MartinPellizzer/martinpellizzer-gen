    "intro": "Potamogeton pusillus var. rutiloides, commonly known as the golden watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It has slender, branching stems that are often covered with small, oval leaves arranged in whorls. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in slow-moving or still waters with soft sediment, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some water bodies if not managed properly."
