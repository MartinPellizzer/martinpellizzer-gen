    "intro": "Pityrogramma tartarea var. arcuata, commonly known as the wavy water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Pityrogramma. It is a small, aquatic fern that typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often curled or wavy, giving it its common name. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Pityrogramma genus. This variant is notable for its ability to thrive in both still and flowing water environments."
