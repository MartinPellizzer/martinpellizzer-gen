    "intro": "Pyrus ringo fastigiata, commonly known as the upright apple tree, is a cultivar of the apple tree that exhibits a tall, columnar growth habit. It is characterized by its narrow, upright form, which makes it ideal for small spaces and urban landscapes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible apples that are typically smaller than those of standard apple varieties. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, providing year-round visual interest. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
