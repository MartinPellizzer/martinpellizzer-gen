    "intro": "Pedicularis venusta var. schmidtii, commonly known as Schmidt's beautyflower, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its flowers, which range in color from pink to purple, bloom in late summer and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies."
