    "intro": "Pseudotsuga taxifolia subsp. glauca, commonly known as the blue spruce, is a subspecies of the Douglas fir native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive blue-gray foliage, which results from a waxy coating on the needles. The tree typically grows to heights of 20\u201340 meters, with a conical shape and dense, compact branches. Its cones are small and woody, containing two to three oval seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
