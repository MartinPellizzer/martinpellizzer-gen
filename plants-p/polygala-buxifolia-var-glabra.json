    "intro": "Polygala buxifolia var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth boxleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its leaves are elliptical and often resemble those of boxwood, giving it its common name. The flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
