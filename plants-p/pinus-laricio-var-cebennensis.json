    "intro": "Pinus laricio var. cebennensis, commonly known as the Cebenna stone pine, is a variant of the stone pine native to the eastern Alps. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its long, needle-like leaves and distinctive pine cones. The tree typically grows in rocky, mountainous regions, adapting to poor soil conditions. Its cones are often large and persistent, contributing to its ecological role in seed dispersal. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in forestry and horticulture."
