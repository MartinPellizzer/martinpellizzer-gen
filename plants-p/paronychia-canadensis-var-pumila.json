    "intro": "Paronychia canadensis var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf sandverbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It typically reaches heights of only a few inches, with small, hairy leaves that are usually arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as dunes or disturbed areas. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping."
