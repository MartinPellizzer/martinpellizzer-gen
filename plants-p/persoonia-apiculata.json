    "intro": "Persoonia apiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghost pipe, is a shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Persoonia apiculata is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
