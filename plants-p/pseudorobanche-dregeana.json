    "intro": "Pseudorobanche dregeana, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is native to regions of Africa and the Middle East. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that attaches to its host. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or through human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host plants, making it a potential agricultural concern."
