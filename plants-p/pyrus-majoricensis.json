    "intro": "Pyrus majoricensis, commonly known as the Majorica pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the island of Majorca in the Balearic Islands, Spain. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, producing small, rounded leaves and clusters of white flowers in spring. Its fruit, a small pear-like fruit, ripens in late summer and is edible. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus majoricensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
