    "intro": "Phacelia tanacetifolia var. hubbyi, commonly known as the Hubby's phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of Tanacetum, hence its species name. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
