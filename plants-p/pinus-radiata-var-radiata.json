    "intro": "Pinus radiata var. radiata, commonly known as the Monterey pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. It is characterized by its straight, tall trunk and needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It is well adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. This species is also valued for its timber and is often planted in reforestation projects."
