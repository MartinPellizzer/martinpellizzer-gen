    "intro": "Palicourea demissa, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or yellow starvine, is a climbing shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties. Palicourea demissa thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories."
