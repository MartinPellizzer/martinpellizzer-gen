    "intro": "Polygala amarella var. minus, commonly known as the lesser yellow milk-vetch, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of arid ecosystem biodiversity."
