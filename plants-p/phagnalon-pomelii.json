    "intro": "Phagnalon pomelii, commonly known as the coastal phagnalon, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in coastal environments, often found on rocky soils and cliffs. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers, which are characteristic of the daisy family. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Phagnalon pomelii plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
