    "intro": "Piper pebasense, commonly known as the Amazonian pepper or pebas pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the rainforests of South America, particularly the Amazon Basin, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are followed by elongated, peppery fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its unique flavor and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and ethnobotrists."
