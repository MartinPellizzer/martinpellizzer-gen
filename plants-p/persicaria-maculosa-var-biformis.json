It features upright stems that are often reddish in color and bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple or reddish mottling. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.
