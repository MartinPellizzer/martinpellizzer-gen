    "intro": "Paspalum iridaceum, commonly known as the iridescence grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that often display a striking blue or purple hue. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green color. Paspalum iridaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian zones."
