    "intro": "Paraceterach delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and it plays a role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitat."
