    "intro": "Potentilla multifoliolata, commonly known as the many-leaved cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The leaves are pinnately compound, with multiple leaflets that give the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
