    "intro": "Polystichum longispinosum, commonly known as the long-spined wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments with a distinctive, spiny appearance along the edges. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forests and rocky areas. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
