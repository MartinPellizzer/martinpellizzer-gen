    "intro": "Polystachya longevaginata, commonly known as the long sheath fir. This orchid is native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a pseudobulbous structure with elongated, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, fibrous sheath. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in a raceme. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
