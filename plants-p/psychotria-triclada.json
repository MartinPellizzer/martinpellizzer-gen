    "intro": "Psychotria triclada, commonly known as the \"devil's weed,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests. Psychotria triclada is also known for containing psychoactive alkaloids, including dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which has contributed to its use in traditional shamanic practices. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and culturally important in certain indigenous communities."
