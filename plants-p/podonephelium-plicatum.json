    "intro": "Podonephelium plicatum, commonly known as the pleated fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pleated fronds that give it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species. The botanical features of Podonephelium plicatum make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
