It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that are often a deep green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. It is a popular houseplant due to its ease of care and attractive foliage.
