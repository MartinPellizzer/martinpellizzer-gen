It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is an erect perennial herb that grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and relatively understudied species."
