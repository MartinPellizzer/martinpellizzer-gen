    "intro": "Pyrus communis f. longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed common pear, is a unique variant of the common pear tree. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and foliage, which distinguish it from the standard form of Pyrus communis. The leaves are typically longer and more slender, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, ornamental flowers in spring, followed by edible fruit similar to the common pear. This form is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes."
