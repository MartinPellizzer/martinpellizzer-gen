    "intro": "Phegopteris ciliata, commonly known as the fringed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are adorned with fine, ciliate (fringed) margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, organic soil. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The fringed wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
