    "intro": "Polypodium recurvatum var. paraguayense, commonly known as the Paraguay shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds produce sporangia on the underside, which release spores for reproduction."
