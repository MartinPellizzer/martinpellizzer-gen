It is a small, terrestrial orchid with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, spurred flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip structure. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
