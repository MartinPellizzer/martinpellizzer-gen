    "intro": "Peliosanthes yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, typically in moist, well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
