    "intro": "Platanus occidentalis var. suttneri, commonly known as the Suttner's sycamore, is a variant of the American sycamore. It is characterized by its distinctive bark that peels in thin, papery layers, revealing a mottled pattern of green, white, and brown. The leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough, serrated edge. It produces spherical, fuzzy seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils."
