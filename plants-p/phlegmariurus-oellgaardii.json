    "intro": "Phlegmariurus oellgaardii, commonly known as the Oellgaard's clubmoss, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale to dark green thallus, which is often covered in a layer of fine, white or yellowish powdery substances. The plant typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in moist, shaded environments, particularly in temperate regions. It is a foliose lichen, meaning it has a leaf-like structure with distinct upper and lower surfaces. Phlegmariurus oellgaardii plays an important role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
