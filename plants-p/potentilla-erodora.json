    "intro": "Potentilla erodora, commonly known as sandbank cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to North America. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dunes. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are often hairy and have a rough texture. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
