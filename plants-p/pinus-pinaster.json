    "intro": "Pinus pinaster, commonly known as the maritime pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and long, needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of two. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and birds. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and pests. Pinus pinaster is valued for its timber and plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
