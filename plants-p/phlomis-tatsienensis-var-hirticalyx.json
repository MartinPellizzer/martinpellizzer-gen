    "intro": "Phlomis tatsienensis var. hirticalyx, commonly known as the hairy-leaved phlomis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and gray-green, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces showy, spires of purple or pink flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological landscapes."
