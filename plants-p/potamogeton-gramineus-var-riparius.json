    "intro": "Potamogeton gramineus var. riparius, commonly known as the river pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are often submerged or just at the water's surface. This plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in slow-moving to still waters, often found in lakes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence can indicate good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
