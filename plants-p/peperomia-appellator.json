It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture, often adorned with intricate patterns or veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which are followed by tiny, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity. Peperomia appellator is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and low maintenance requirements."
