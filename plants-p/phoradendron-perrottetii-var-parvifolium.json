    "intro": "Phoradendron perrottetii var. parvifolium, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various species of oaks and other hardwood trees. It produces small, oval-shaped berries that are typically red or yellow in color, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers during the spring. It forms dense clusters on its host tree, often leading to the formation of characteristic \"mistletoe\" clusters. This species is native to the southeastern United States and is an important part of the ecosystem, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
