    "intro": "Panicum polymorphum var. densum, commonly known as dense bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often tinged with red or purple in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common species in prairie and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
