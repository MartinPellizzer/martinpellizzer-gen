    "intro": "Potentilla sciaphila, commonly known as the shade-loving cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, delicate yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with five to seven lobes, and are covered in fine, soft hairs. Potentilla sciaphila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden settings where partial shade is present."
