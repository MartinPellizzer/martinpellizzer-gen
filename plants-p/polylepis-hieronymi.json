    "intro": "Polylepis hieronymi, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a member of the Rosaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, waxy leaves that help it survive in cold and arid conditions. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and has a slow growth rate, making it long-lived. It plays a crucial role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various species. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered endangered in many areas."
