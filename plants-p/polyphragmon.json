    "intro": "Polyphragmon, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. Polyphragmon is known for its toxic properties, containing compounds such as cardiac glycosides that can be harmful to humans and animals. It is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its toxicity."
