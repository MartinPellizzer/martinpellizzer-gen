    "intro": "Poa rhadina, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed florets. Poa rhadina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
