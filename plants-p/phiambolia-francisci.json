It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
