    "intro": "Pinguicula corsica var. coerulescens, commonly known as the Corsican butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology and carnivorous habits make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
