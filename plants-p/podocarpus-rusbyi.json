    "intro": "Podocarpus rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's podocarp, is a species of coniferous tree native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and conical shape. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils within forest ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
