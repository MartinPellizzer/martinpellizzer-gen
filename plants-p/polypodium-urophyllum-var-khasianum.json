    "intro": "Polypodium urophyllum var. khasianum, commonly known as the Khasi polypody, is a fern native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in dense forest understories. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
