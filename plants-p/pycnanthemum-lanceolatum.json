    "intro": "Pycnanthemum lanceolatum, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Pycnanthemum lanceolatum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in challenging environments."
