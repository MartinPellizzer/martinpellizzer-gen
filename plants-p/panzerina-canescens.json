    "intro": "Panzerina canescens, commonly known as the sand dune evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy, grayish-green leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its roots are adapted to stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in dune ecosystems. Panzerina canescens is often found in coastal areas of North America, particularly along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts."
