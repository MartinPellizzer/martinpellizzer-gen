    "intro": "Phenax sonneratii var. mycrophylla, commonly known as the small-leaved phenax, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
