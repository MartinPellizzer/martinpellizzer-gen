    "intro": "Parietaria alsinefolia, commonly known as the common wall-rocket, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with small, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in woodland areas. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisine, while its seeds are dispersed by wind. Parietaria alsinefolia plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
