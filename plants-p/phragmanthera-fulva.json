    "intro": "Phragmanthera fulva, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers with a contrasting purple or brown center. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture. The orchid produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
