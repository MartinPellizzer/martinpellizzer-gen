    "intro": "Pleopeltis \u00d7 sordidula, commonly known as the sordidula fern, is a hybrid species within the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This hybrid exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant hybridization."
