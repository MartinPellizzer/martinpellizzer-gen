    "intro": "Pandanus macrocephalus, commonly known as the giant pandanus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are often followed by spiky, woody fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is often used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber. Its unique morphology makes it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts."
