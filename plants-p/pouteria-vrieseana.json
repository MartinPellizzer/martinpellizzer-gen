    "intro": "Pouteria vrieseana, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and clusters of yellowish-white flowers. The tree produces large, elongated fruits that contain a single, edible seed surrounded by a hard, woody shell. The seeds, known as Brazil nuts, are rich in protein and essential nutrients. This species plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat and is also economically important for its nut production."
