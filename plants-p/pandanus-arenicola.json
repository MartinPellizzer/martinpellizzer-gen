    "intro": "Pandanus arenicola, commonly known as the beach pandanus, is a shrub-like plant native to coastal areas of the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, followed by edible, fibrous fruits. Its adaptability to sandy, saline soils makes it a common sight in beach and dune ecosystems. Pandanus arenicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
