    "intro": "Polygala grandifolia, commonly known as the sweet pepper vine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial vine characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a distinctive, inflated capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Botanically, it belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
