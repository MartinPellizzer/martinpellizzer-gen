    "intro": "Puya cochabambensis, commonly known as the Cochabamba puya, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant features broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowers, which bloom in a striking display of red, orange, and yellow, are clustered at the tip of the stem. Puya cochabambensis is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in cool, moist conditions with ample sunlight."
