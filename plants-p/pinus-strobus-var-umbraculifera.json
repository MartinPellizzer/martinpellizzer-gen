    "intro": "Pinus strobus var. umbraculifera, commonly known as the shade-tolerant eastern white pine, is a variant of the eastern white pine characterized by its ability to thrive in partially shaded environments. This variety typically exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the standard eastern white pine, with shorter, more densely packed needles. The cones are similar to those of the typical species, but the foliage tends to be darker and more closely arranged. It is native to the northeastern United States and is often found in forest understories where light levels are lower. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in shaded habitats."
