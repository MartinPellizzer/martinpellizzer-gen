    "intro": "Panicum elegans, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant features slender, arching stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, open cluster of spikelets, which produce small, pale green to brown flowers. Panicum elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wetland environments."
