    "intro": "Plantago marina, commonly known as sea plantain, is a flowering plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in salt marshes, sandy shores, and other coastal habitats. Its adaptability to saline soils makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
