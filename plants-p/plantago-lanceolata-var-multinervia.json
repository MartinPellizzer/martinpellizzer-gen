    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata var. multinervia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spikes, which are typically arranged in a terminal inflorescence. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained environments. This variant is distinguished by its finely veined leaves and is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
