    "intro": "Pseudathyrium alpestre var. flexile, commonly known as the flexible alpine fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky slopes and forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor in crevices, while its leaves are covered in a fine layer of trichomes that aid in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
