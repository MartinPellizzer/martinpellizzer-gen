    "intro": "Pedicularis szetschuanica var. elata, commonly known as the tall Chinese lousewort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations. Its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
