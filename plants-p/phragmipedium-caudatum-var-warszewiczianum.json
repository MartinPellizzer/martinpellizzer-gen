    "intro": "Phragmipedium caudatum var. warszewiczianum, commonly known as the Warszewicz's phragmipedium, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a distinctive red or orange lip. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, typically arranged in two rows along the stem. This variety is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific humidity and light requirements."
