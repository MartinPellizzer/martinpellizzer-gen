    "intro": "Petasitis vulgaris, commonly known as the common water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has floating leaves that are heart-shaped and often have a waxy surface, while its roots are submerged. Petasitis vulgaris produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or brown, and it relies on wind for pollination. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
