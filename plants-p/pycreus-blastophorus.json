    "intro": "Pycreus blastophorus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Pycreus blastophorus is critically endangered and protected in many regions."
