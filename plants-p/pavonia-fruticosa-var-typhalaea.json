    "intro": "Pavonia fruticosa var. typhalaea, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to deep purple. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture and are arranged oppositely along the stems. Pavonia fruticosa var. typhalaea thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established."
