    "intro": "Phyllocephalum tenue, commonly known as the slender leaf fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in freshwater habitats such as streams and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds. The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
