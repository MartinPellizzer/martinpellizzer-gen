    "intro": "Pyrus legrei, commonly known as the Kashmir pear, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and fragrant flowers. The tree produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are edible but less commonly cultivated for commercial use. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. Pyrus legrei is often grown in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, mountainous climates."
