    "intro": "Pellaea cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf fern, is a species of fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped fronds that are typically light green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or wooded areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats. Pellaea cordifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
