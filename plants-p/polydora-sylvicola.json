It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually white or pale green, and are adapted for pollination by insects.
