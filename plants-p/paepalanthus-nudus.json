It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to grow in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
