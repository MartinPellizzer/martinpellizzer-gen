It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Prescottia tenuis is a slow-growing plant that is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience in dry conditions."
