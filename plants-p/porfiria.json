    "intro": "Porfiria, commonly known as the \"fireweed\" or \"willow herb,\" is a flowering plant belonging to the Onagraceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, often pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in disturbed soils, such as those found along roadsides or in open fields. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from poor soil. Porfiria is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
