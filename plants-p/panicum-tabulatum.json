    "intro": "Panicum tabulatum, commonly known as the rigid grass or slender panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Panicum tabulatum plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
