    "intro": "Pterophylla sylvicola, commonly known as the swamp gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of blue or violet flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Pterophylla sylvicola plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its wetland ecosystem."
