    "intro": "Pleione graminifolia, commonly known as the grassy pleione, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in rocky or mossy substrates. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
