    "intro": "Prunus communis proles gymnoclada, commonly known as the European blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of white or pale green flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries known as sloes. These berries are used in the making of sloe gin and are also valued for their medicinal properties. The species is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
