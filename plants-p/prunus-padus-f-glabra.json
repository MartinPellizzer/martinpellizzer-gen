    "intro": "Prunus padus f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-flowered white cherry, is a botanical variant of the common bird cherry. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous petals that give it a distinctive appearance compared to the typical form. The plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in woodland edges and river valleys. Its flowers bloom in early spring, producing a showy white display that attracts pollinators. The fruit is a small, yellowish drupe that ripens in late summer."
