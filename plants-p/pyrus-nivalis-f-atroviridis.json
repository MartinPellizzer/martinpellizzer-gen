It is characterized by its deep green foliage, which contrasts strikingly with its white or pale green fruits. This variety is typically smaller than the typical species, making it suitable for smaller gardens or containers. The leaves are usually elliptical and have a smooth texture, while the fruits are small and often have a slight tart flavor. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in landscape design."
