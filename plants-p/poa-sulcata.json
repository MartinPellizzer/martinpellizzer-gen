    "intro": "Poa sulcata, commonly known as the sulcate bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Poa sulcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for its delicate appearance."
