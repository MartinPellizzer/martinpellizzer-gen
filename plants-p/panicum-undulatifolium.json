    "intro": "Panicum undulatifolium, commonly known as the wavy-leaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, wavy-edged leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, beige to brownish flowers. It thrives in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is often found in disturbed soils. Panicum undulatifolium plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
