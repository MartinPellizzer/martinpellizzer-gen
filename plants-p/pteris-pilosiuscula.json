    "intro": "Pteris pilosiuscula, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in a dense layer of soft, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are arranged in lines along the undersides of the fronds. Pteris pilosiuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
