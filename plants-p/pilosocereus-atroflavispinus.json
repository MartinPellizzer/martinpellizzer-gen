    "intro": "Pilosocereus atroflavispinus, commonly known as the black-spined pincushion cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a spherical or columnar shape. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant's dark, waxy spines provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight."
