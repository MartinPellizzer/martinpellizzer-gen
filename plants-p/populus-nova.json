    "intro": "Populus nova, commonly known as the New World poplar, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are essential for wind pollination. Its rapid growth rate makes it a valuable species for reforestation and erosion control. Populus nova also has medicinal properties, with its bark historically used in traditional medicine."
