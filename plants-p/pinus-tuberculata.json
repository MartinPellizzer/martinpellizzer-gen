    "intro": "Pinus tuberculata, commonly known as the knobcone pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, scaly bark and its dense, pyramidal shape. The needles are typically short and stout, growing in clusters of five, and the cones are often covered in small, raised tubercles, giving them their common name. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
