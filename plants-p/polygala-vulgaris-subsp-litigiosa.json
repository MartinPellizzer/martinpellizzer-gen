    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris subsp. litigiosa, commonly known as the litigious milkwort, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. The plant has small, delicate leaves and produces clusters of pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are characterized by their spurred petals, which are a distinctive feature of the Polygala genus. It is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
