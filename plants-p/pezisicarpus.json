    "intro": "Pezisicarpus, commonly known as the ghost fungus, is a genus of fungi that belongs to the family Tricholomataceae. These fungi are characterized by their unique, often ghostly appearance, with a pale, almost translucent cap that can resemble a ghostly figure. They are typically found in temperate and subtropical regions, growing on decaying wood in forests. The fruiting bodies of Pezisicarpus species are usually small to medium in size, with a smooth or slightly scaly surface. They play an important ecological role in decomposing organic matter and recycling nutrients in forest ecosystems."
