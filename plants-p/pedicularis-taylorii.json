It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically range in color from red to purple. It grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
