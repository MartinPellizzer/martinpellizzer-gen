    "intro": "Pleuropteropyrum ajanense, commonly known as the Ajanese rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, intricately lobed fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, typical of the fern family. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
