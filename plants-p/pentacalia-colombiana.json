    "intro": "Pentacalia colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. The flowers, which bloom in late spring, are usually blue or violet in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
