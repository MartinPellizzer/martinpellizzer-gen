    "intro": "Pandanus forbesii, commonly known as the silver pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white powder, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or green, followed by fibrous, coconut-like fruits. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional crafts, while the leaves are used for thatching and weaving. Pandanus forbesii thrives in coastal areas and is often found in wetlands or near the shoreline."
