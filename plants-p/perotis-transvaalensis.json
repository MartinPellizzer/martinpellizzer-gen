    "intro": "Perotis transvaalensis, commonly known as the Transvaal daisy, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant has hairy, linear leaves and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. It is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun, contributing to its popularity among gardeners. The flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, adding vibrant color to the garden during the warmer months."
