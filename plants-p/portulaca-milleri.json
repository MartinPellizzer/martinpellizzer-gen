    "intro": "Portulaca milleri, commonly known as the Mexican moss rose, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a low-growing annual species that thrives in hot, arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, vibrant flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom throughout the summer months. Its succulent leaves are fleshy and rounded, helping it store water for survival in dry conditions. Portulaca milleri is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its hardiness and colorful display."
