    "intro": "Premna cyclophylla, commonly known as the waxy leaf premna, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, giving them a distinctive appearance. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
