    "intro": "Pedicularis leucodon var. malyi, commonly known as the Malyi lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes hemiparasitic plants that derive some of their nutrients from host plants. The species is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
