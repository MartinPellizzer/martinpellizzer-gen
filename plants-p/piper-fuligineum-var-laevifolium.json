It is characterized by its dark green, smooth, and elliptical leaves that are often glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by elongated, slender fruits that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. It is typically found in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
