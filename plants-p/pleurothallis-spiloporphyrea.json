    "intro": "Pleurothallis spiloporphyrea, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, delicate flowers with striking red and green veining, which are often clustered in inflorescences. Its pseudobulbs are typically short and stout, supporting the plant's foliage and flowering structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
