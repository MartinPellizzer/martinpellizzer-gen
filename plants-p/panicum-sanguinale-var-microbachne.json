    "intro": "Panicum sanguinale var. microbachne, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, red-brown spikelets that are often tinged with purple. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, such as in marshes, swamps, and along streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
