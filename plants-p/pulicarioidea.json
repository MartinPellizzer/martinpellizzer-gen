    "intro": "Pulicarioidea, commonly known as the \"stinkweed\" family, is a group of flowering plants belonging to the order Malvales. These plants are characterized by their small, often hairy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. They are predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions, with a diverse range of species across various habitats. The fruits of Pulicarioidea are usually capsules that release seeds through mechanical means, aiding in their dispersal. Many species in this group are used in traditional medicine due to their potential pharmacological properties."
