    "intro": "Pteridrys acutissima, commonly known as the sharp-pointed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a lacy appearance. Pteridrys acutissima thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
