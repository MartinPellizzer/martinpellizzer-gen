    "intro": "Pseudo-fumaria acaulis, commonly known as the stemless fumaria, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Fumariaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of a distinct stem, with the leaves directly emerging from the root system. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation."
