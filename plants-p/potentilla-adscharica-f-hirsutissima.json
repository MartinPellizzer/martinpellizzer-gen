    "intro": "Potentilla adscharica f. hirsutissima, commonly known as the Hirsute Cinquefoil, is a variant of the species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its hirsute (hairy) leaves are a distinguishing feature, contributing to its ability to retain moisture in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
