    "intro": "Polystichum polyodon, commonly known as the broadleaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that give the plant a dense, lush appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland understories. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the spring and summer months."
