    "intro": "Platanus \u00d7 cantabrigensis, commonly known as the London plane, is a hybrid tree resulting from the cross between the American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) and the European sycamore (Platanus orientalis). It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that split open to release seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to urban environments. Its bark is thick, flaky, and often has a mottled appearance."
