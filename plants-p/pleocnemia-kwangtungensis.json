    "intro": "Pleocnemia kwangtungensis, commonly known as the Guangdong pleocnemia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to southern China. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae, which includes ferns and their allies. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
