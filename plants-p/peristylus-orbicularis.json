It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and possesses narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on short, upright stems. Peristylus orbicularis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
