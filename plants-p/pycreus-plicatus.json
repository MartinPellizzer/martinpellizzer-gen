    "intro": "Pycreus plicatus, commonly known as the pleated fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pleated fronds that give it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
