    "intro": "Platanthera solstitialis var. pervia, commonly known as the early purple orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and moist meadows in North America. It is characterized by its pale violet to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a slender, upright stem with lance-shaped leaves and produces a single, showy flower per stem. It is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, typical of many orchid species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions and is often protected in conservation efforts."
