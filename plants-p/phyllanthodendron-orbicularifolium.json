    "intro": "Phyllanthodendron orbicularifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved phyllanthus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Phyllanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its orbicular (round) leaves, which are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
