    "intro": "Pavonia calyculina, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, sandy soils, often found in desert or coastal environments. The plant produces small, showy pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Pavonia calyculina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
