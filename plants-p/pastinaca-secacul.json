    "intro": "Pastinaca secacul, commonly known as wild parsnip, is a biennial plant belonging to the carrot family (Apiaceae). It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, deeply lobed leaves that resemble those of parsley. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are cylindrical and can grow quite thick, often with a pale yellow or white color. Wild parsnip is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been naturalized in North America."
