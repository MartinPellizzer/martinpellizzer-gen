    "intro": "Pleurobotryum rhabdosepalum, commonly known as the broad-sworded pleurobotryum, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
