    "intro": "Pinus laricio subsp. leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaved stone pine, is a rare and relict species native to the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of other pine species. The tree produces cones that are often pendulous and can remain on the branches for several years. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, mountainous environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
