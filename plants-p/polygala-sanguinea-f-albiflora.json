    "intro": "Polygala sanguinea f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the Polygalaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. This variety is distinguished by its pale flowers, which set it apart from the more commonly known red-flowered form of the species."
