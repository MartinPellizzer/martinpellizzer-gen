    "intro": "Polypodium choquetangense, commonly known as the Choquetangense fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in botanical gardens."
