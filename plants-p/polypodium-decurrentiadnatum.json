It is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is short and often covered with a layer of brown, leathery tissue. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, broad, wedge-shaped appearance."
