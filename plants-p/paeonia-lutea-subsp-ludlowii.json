    "intro": "Paeonia lutea subsp. ludlowii, commonly known as the Ludlow's peony, is a rare and endangered subspecies native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with a subtle reddish tinge and deeply lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. It has a short growth cycle, blooming in late spring and going dormant quickly. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly susceptible to environmental changes."
