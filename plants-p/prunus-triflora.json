    "intro": "Prunus triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically alternate. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, edible berries. Prunus triflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings."
