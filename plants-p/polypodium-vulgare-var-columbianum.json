    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare var. columbianum, commonly known as the common harts-tongue fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with a broad, strap-like frond that is usually dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. This variant is distinguished by its slightly shorter and more compact fronds compared to the typical *Polypodium vulgare*."
