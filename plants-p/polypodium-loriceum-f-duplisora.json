    "intro": "Polypodium loriceum f. duplisora, commonly known as the double-leaf water fern, is a rare fern species characterized by its unique frond morphology. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a distinctive feature where its fronds produce two separate leaves, a trait that sets it apart from other members of the species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its botanical significance lies in its structural variation and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
