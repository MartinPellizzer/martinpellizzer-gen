    "intro": "Pavetta constipulata var. geoscopa, commonly known as the rock pavetta, is a shrub native to the rocky and arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its fleshy, berry-like fruits are typically red or orange when mature and contain several seeds. This species is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy plant in its native habitat."
