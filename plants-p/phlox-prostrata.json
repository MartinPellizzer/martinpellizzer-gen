It features dense clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its foliage consists of narrow, dark green leaves that are slightly hairy. Creeping phlox thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens."
