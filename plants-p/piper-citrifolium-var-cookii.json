It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often citron-yellow in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are typically used for their aromatic properties rather than for consumption. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental or for its fragrant foliage. Due to its unique characteristics, it is a subject of interest in botanical research and horticulture."
