    "intro": "Pitcairnia mituensis, commonly known as the Crimson Pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Amazon rainforest of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround its inflorescence, which can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in its humid, tropical habitat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on trees or rocky surfaces. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
