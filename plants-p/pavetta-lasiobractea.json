It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. Pavetta lasiobractea is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and thickets."
