    "intro": "Porophyllum cusimbua, commonly known as the Mexican blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. The small blue to purple flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
