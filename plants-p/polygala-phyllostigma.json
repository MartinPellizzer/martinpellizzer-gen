    "intro": "Polygala phyllostigma, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers with distinctive, thread-like petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
