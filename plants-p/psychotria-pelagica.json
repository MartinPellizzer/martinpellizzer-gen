    "intro": "Psychotria pelagica, commonly known as the sea psychotria, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the dry season. Its leaves are elliptical and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Psychotria pelagica is adapted to withstand high salinity and strong coastal winds, making it a hardy species in marine ecosystems."
