    "intro": "Pitcairnia irwiniana, commonly known as the Irwin's pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright rosette of dark green, narrow leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces showy, violet-pink flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, adding a dramatic visual element. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
