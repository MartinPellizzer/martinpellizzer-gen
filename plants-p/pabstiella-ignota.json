    "intro": "Pabstiella ignota, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly dependent on its environment. Its delicate structure and specialized pollination requirements contribute to its elusive nature. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Pabstiella ignota is considered critically endangered."
