    "intro": "Polystichum denticulatum var. rigidissima, commonly known as the rigid holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its stiff, upright fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, toothed segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, providing visual interest in shaded gardens."
