    "intro": "Physaria integrifolia, commonly known as the bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, inflated seed pods that split open to release seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. Physaria integrifolia is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants."
