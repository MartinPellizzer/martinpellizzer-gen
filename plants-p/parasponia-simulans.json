    "intro": "Parasponia simulans, commonly known as the parasitic sponge tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it can photosynthesize but also derives some of its nutrients from host plants. The plant has small, simple leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its roots can form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to host roots to absorb water and nutrients. Parasponia simulans is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests."
