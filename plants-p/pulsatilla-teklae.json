It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and large, showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
