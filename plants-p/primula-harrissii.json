    "intro": "Primula harrissii, commonly known as Harriss's primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the cultivar. The plant has a rosette of broad, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded woodlands or rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
