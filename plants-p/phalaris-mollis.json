    "intro": "Phalaris mollis, commonly known as soft brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, and its leaves are narrow with a bluish-green color. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Phalaris mollis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
