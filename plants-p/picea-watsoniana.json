    "intro": "Picea watsoniana, commonly known as the Watson's spruce, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
