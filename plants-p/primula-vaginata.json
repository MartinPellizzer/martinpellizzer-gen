    "intro": "Primula vaginata, commonly known as the broad-leaf primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections worldwide."
