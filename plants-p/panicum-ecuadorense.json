    "intro": "Panicum ecuadorense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, thriving in cooler, temperate climates. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying high-altitude flora."
