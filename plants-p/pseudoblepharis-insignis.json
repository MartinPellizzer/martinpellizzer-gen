    "intro": "Pseudoblepharis insignis, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit with silver-gray foliage adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with tubular centers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pseudoblepharis insignis is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
