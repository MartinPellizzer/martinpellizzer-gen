It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to withstand cold and harsh weather conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, providing insulation against frost. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in high-altitude ecosystems."
