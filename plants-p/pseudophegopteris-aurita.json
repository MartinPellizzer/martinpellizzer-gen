    "intro": "Pseudophegopteris aurita, commonly known as the golden fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, golden-yellow fronds that are both showy and delicate. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
