    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 smithianum, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, slightly lobed leaves that resemble ivy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming from spring to autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
