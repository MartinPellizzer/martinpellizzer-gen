It consists of several species that are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in South America. The plants are small, herbaceous, and often have succulent leaves adapted to conserve water. They produce small, white or pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Paragynoxys species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
