    "intro": "Patagonium subterraneum, commonly known as the subterranean grass, is a unique plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense, grass-like foliage. The plant thrives in harsh, high-altitude environments with limited soil and extreme temperature fluctuations. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in rocky, nutrient-poor substrates. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to survive in subterranean conditions, with some parts of its root system extending deep into the soil."
