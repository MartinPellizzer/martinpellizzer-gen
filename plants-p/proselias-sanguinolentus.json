It is characterized by its vivid red veins running through its dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, spore-bearing cones that are often hidden among its foliage. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial shade to flourish. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists alike."
