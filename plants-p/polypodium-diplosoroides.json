    "intro": "Polypodium diplosoroides, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, arranged in clusters called sori, which are covered by indusia. Polypodium diplosoroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage."
