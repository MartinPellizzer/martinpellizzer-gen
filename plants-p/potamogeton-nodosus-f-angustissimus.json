It has small, unisexual flowers arranged in spikelets, with the male flowers usually located above the female ones. The plant is native to freshwater habitats in North America and is often found in slow-moving waters or ponds. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its morphology is adapted for efficient photosynthesis in submerged environments."
