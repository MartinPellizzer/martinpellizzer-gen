    "intro": "Poa zaprjagajevii, commonly known as the Zaprjagajev's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green blades that are often covered in a powdery bloom. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its inflorescence consists of compact, cylindrical spikelets that bear small, two-lobed florets. Poa zaprjagajevii plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme conditions."
