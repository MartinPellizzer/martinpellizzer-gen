    "intro": "Psilochenia modocensis subsp. glareosa, commonly known as the Modoc Desert spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Great Basin region of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with stiff, spiny bracts. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color, which are adapted to the arid environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in salt marshes and wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of its habitat."
