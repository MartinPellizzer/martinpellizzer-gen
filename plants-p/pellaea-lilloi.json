    "intro": "Pellaea lilloi, commonly known as the Lillo's cliff fern, is a species of fern native to southern South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, arid environments. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, narrow shape. It produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, typical of the fern family. Pellaea lilloi is often found growing on cliffs or in crevices, where it adapts well to poor soil conditions."
