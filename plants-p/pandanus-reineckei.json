    "intro": "Pandanus reineckei, commonly known as the coconut pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, pinnate leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into clusters of fibrous, coconut-like fruits. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize coastal soils, making it useful for erosion control. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and windy environments."
