    "intro": "Pauridiantha, commonly known as the African star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring strap-like, evergreen leaves that are broad and glossy. Pauridiantha thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.
