    "intro": "Pedicularis lutescens subsp. ramosa, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its distinctive branched stems and clustered flowers make it a striking addition to botanical gardens and a subject of interest for plant enthusiasts."
