    "intro": "Pellaea crenata, commonly known as the serrated cliff fern, is a perennial fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically divided into small, toothed segments. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in open, sunny habitats. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a distinctive serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Pellaea crenata is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
