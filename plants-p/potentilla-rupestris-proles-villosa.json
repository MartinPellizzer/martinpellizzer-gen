    "intro": "Potentilla rupestris proles villosa, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with wiry, often hairy stems that help it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its characteristic \"woolly\" appearance. This species is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in alpine or coastal regions."
