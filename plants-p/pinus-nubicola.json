    "intro": "Pinus nubicola, commonly known as the Nubian pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are woody and often remain attached to the branches for several years. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the rugged terrain of its native habitat. The Nubian pine plays an important ecological role in its ecosystem, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
