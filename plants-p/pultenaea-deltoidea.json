The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring. It is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Pultenaea deltoidea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
