    "intro": "Poa radiata, commonly known as New Zealand grass or silver grass, is a perennial tussock grass native to New Zealand. It features tufted, silver-gray leaves that are narrow and slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Poa radiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in natural environments."
