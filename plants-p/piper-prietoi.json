    "intro": "Piper prietoi, commonly known as the Mexican pepper plant, is a flowering plant native to Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species such as the common black pepper. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage rather than its fruits."
