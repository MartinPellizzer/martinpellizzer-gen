    "intro": "Persea hypericifolia, commonly known as the Mexican avocado or Mexican spondias, is a small evergreen tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits with a thick, leathery skin that encases a single, large seed. While its fruit is not typically consumed by humans, it is used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
