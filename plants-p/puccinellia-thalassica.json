    "intro": "Puccinellia thalassica, commonly known as sea barley, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is a perennial grass that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including strong winds and salt spray. Puccinellia thalassica plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal areas."
