    "intro": "Panicum bernoullianum, commonly known as the Bernoullian grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it to retain moisture in arid environments. Panicum bernoullianum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
