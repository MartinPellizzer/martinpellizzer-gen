    "intro": "Phoradendron trisulcatum, commonly known as the three-ridged mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has a distinctive appearance with smooth, dark green foliage and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red or orange in color, which are important for seed dispersal by birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis. The three-ridged structure of its leaves is a key identifying feature of this species."
