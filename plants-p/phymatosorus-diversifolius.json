    "intro": "Phymatosorus diversifolius, commonly known as the variable fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that exhibit a wide variation in shape and size, often with a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
