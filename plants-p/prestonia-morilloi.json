    "intro": "Prestonia morilloi, commonly known as the Morillo's prestonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other flowering plants with characteristic latex sap. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prestonia morilloi is considered a rare and less-studied species."
