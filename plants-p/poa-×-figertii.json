    "intro": "Poa \u00d7 figertii, commonly known as the hybrid bluegrass, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Poa annua and Poa pratensis. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and a tufted growth habit, typical of many bluegrass species. This plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions. Due to its sterility, it does not produce seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, attractive lawns."
