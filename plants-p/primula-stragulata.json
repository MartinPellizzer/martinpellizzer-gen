    "intro": "Primula stragulata, commonly known as the woolly primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps to retain moisture. Primula stragulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
