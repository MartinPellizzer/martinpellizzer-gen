    "intro": "Pleione amoena, commonly known as the orchid of the mountains, is a species of terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has fleshy, underground rhizomes that store nutrients, allowing it to survive in cool, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, often forming a rosette near the base of the plant. Pleione amoena is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its unique flowering period."
