    "intro": "Pleione occultata, commonly known as the hidden pleione, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant's leaves are broad and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
