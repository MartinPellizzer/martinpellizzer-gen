    "intro": "Phelypaea ramosa var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered water shield, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers that are typically clustered at the base of the leaves. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, and it plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments. This species is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments."
