    "intro": "Polypodium clarkei, commonly known as the Clarke's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium clarkei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
