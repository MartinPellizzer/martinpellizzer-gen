    "intro": "Portulaca cypria, commonly known as the Armenian carnation, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Its flowers typically open in the morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. Portulaca cypria is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
