    "intro": "Polystichum nigrospinosum, commonly known as the black spiny wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, spinelike structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are typically clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in forests with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is considered a valuable species for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
