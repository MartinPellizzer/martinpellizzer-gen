    "intro": "Pericopsis mooniana, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its aesthetic and commercial properties. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
