    "intro": "Pentaraphia verrucosa, commonly known as the roughleaf dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of thick, waxy, and often hairy leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in small, raised bumps. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive pappus-equipped seeds for wind dispersal. Its leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, and it is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils. The species is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and ecological resilience in arid environments."
