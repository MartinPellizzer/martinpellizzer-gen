The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar to pears in taste. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The rough-leaved pear is also valued for its potential in horticulture and as a source of medicinal compounds."
