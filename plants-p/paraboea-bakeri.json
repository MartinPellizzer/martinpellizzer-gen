    "intro": "Paraboea bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's paraboea, is a flowering plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. The species is noted for its delicate, fragrant blooms that appear in clusters, making it a sought-after plant in tropical horticulture."
