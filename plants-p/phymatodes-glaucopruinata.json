    "intro": "Phymatodes glaucopruinata, commonly known as the blue-green phymatode, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
