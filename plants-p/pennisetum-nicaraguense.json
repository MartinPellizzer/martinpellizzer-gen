    "intro": "Pennisetum nicaraguense, commonly known as the Nicaraguan fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to Central America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, slender, grass-like leaves that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces panicles of small, pale green to white flowers, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Pennisetum nicaraguense is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in marginal areas."
