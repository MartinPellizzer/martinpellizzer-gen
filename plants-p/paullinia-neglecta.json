    "intro": "Paullinia neglecta, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible but often have a spicy, peppery taste. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in some regions."
