    "intro": "Pyrus pyraster f. platycarpa, commonly known as the flat-fruited crabapple, is a botanical variant of the common crabapple. It is characterized by its broad, flattened fruit, which distinguishes it from the typical conical shape of other crabapple varieties. The plant is a deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with serrated edges, and it produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring. The flat-fruited form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
