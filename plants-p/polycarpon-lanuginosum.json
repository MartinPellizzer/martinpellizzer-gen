    "intro": "Polycarpon lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are covered in soft, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can spread to form dense mats, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found along stream banks and in woodland edges."
