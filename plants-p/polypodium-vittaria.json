    "intro": "Polypodium vittaria, commonly known as the rattlesnake plantain, is a fern native to North America. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that are typically dark green with a yellowish or brownish margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
