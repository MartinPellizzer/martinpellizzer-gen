    "intro": "Pteris marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesan water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly the Marquesas Islands. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bi-pinnate fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across suitable habitats. Pteris marquesensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its native ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
