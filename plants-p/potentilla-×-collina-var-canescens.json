    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 collina var. canescens, commonly known as the silver potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and low-maintenance choice for landscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance further enhance its suitability for rock gardens and borders."
