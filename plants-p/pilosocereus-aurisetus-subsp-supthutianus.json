    "intro": "Pilosocereus aurisetus subsp. supthutianus, commonly known as the Blue Ghost Cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are often covered in a distinctive blue-gray or bluish-white waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts and conservationists."
