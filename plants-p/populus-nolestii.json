    "intro": "Populus nolestii, commonly known as the Tibetan poplar, is a species of poplar native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, typically turning yellow in the autumn. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction."
