    "intro": "Prasophyllum stellatum, commonly known as the star-leaved orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows on the trunks or branches of trees, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires high humidity to thrive. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in rainforests and is considered a rare and delicate species."
