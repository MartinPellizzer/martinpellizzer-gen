    "intro": "Potamogeton \u00d7 zizii var. methyensis, commonly known as the methane grass or swamp milfoil, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like structures, typically emerging from the water surface. It thrives in nutrient-rich, stagnant or slow-moving waters, often forming dense vegetation that can alter local water chemistry. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, impacting native plant communities and water quality."
