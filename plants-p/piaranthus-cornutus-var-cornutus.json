    "intro": "Piaranthus cornutus var. cornutus, commonly known as the horned pincushion, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with dense, fleshy leaves that form a spherical shape. The plant produces striking, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help reduce water loss. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
