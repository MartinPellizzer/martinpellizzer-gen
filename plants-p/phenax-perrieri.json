    "intro": "Phenax perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. Its blooming period occurs during the spring and early summer, and it is known for its delicate fragrance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Phenax perrieri is now considered endangered in its native range."
