    "intro": "Prunus sativa proles latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are typically white or pink in color. Its fruits are small, dark red cherries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes than for consumption. This species is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
