    "intro": "Psychotria umbellifera, commonly known as the umbrella psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that resemble an umbrella, hence its common name. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as rainforests. Psychotria umbellifera is also known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of alkaloids like dimethyltryptamine (DMT)."
