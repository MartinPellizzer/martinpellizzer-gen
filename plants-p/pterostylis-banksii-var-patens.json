    "intro": "Pterostylis banksii var. patens, commonly known as the Patens Spider Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, greenish-brown flowers that resemble spiders, a feature typical of many orchids in the genus Pterostylis. The plant produces a single, elongated flower spike with a single flower, which is pollinated by specific insect species. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as rainforests and understoreys, often growing on the forest floor. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
