    "intro": "Paphiopedilum curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's orchid, is a rare and exquisite terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features a unique, hairy pseudobulb and produces striking, fragrant flowers with a distinctive lip that is often a different color from the rest of the flower. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a rare beauty to botanical gardens and collections. Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
