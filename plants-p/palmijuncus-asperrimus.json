    "intro": "Palmijuncus asperrimus, commonly known as the rough-tongued palm, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its short, stout trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves that are rough and textured to the touch. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by reddish-brown fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
