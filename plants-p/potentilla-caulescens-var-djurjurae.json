    "intro": "Potentilla caulescens var. djurjurae, commonly known as the Djurjura potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the highland regions of East Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, compact foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the arid and cool conditions of its native habitat. This variant is notable for its resilience and is often found in rocky or sandy soils at elevations above 2,000 meters."
