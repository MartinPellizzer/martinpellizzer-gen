    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium microcephalum, commonly known as the small-headed everlasting flower, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly in the southeastern region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as roadsides and disturbed soils, and it produces small, daisy-like flowers that are often white or pale yellow. Its foliage is usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is also known for its long-lasting blooms, making it a popular choice for dried floral arrangements."
