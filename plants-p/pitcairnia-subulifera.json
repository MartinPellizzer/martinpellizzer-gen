    "intro": "Pitcairnia subulifera, commonly known as the needle-leaf pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, resembling needles, hence its common name. The plant produces striking inflorescences with showy, long-lasting flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in forest understories. Pitcairnia subulifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in many tropical and subtropical gardens."
