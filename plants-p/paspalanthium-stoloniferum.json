    "intro": "Paspalanthium stoloniferum, commonly known as the spreading paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly folded, with a bluish-green coloration. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments where it forms dense mats."
