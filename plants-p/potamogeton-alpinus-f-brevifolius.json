    "intro": "Potamogeton alpinus f. brevifolius, commonly known as the alpine pondweed, is a subspecies of the pondweed genus native to cold, freshwater environments. It is characterized by its short, narrow leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in nutrient-poor, shallow waters. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still waters, such as lakes and ponds, and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the Potamogeton genus. This subspecies plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates."
