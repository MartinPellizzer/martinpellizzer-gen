It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants known for their fragrant leaves. The plant features slender, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple or white, arranged in spikes along the stems. Prostanthera linearis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators."
