    "intro": "Prockiopsis hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's prockiopsis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
