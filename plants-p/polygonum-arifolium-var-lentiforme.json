    "intro": "Polygonum arifolium var. lentiforme, commonly known as the broadleaf smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purplish at the base. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a common weed and a valuable wetland indicator species."
