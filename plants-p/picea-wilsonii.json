    "intro": "Picea wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the stems. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found at high altitudes where it forms part of the forest canopy. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
