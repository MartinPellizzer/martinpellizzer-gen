    "intro": "Peristylus phuwuanensis, commonly known as the Phuwuan's peristylus, is a rare flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth texture, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
