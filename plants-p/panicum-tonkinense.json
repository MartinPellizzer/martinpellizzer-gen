    "intro": "Panicum tonkinense, commonly known as Vietnamese millet, is a grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage crop."
