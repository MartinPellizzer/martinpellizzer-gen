    "intro": "Polypodium pilosissimum var. tunguraguensis, commonly known as the Tunguragua fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, fuzzy texture on the underside. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, humid environments, showcasing its adaptation to high-altitude conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
