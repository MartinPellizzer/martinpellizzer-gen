    "intro": "Pseudoroegneria geniculata subsp. nevskii, commonly known as the Nevskii's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed spikelets. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
