    "intro": "Psidium racemosum, commonly known as the clustered guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dense, racemose inflorescences that bear small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in appearance to guavas but are typically smaller and have a more acidic flavor. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a leathery texture with a fragrant aroma. Psidium racemosum is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and floral display."
