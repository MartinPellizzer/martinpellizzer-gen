    "intro": "Pulassarium obtusifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf pulassarium, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
