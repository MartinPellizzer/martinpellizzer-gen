It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that features small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and purple. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils. Phaenixopus ramosissimus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
