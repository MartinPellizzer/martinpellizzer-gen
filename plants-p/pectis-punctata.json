    "intro": "Pectis punctata, commonly known as the dotted pectis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves with a rough texture, and its flowers are typically yellow with a central disk. Pectis punctata is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in rocky areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience."
