    "intro": "Peucedanum ostruthium, commonly known as the cow parsley or wild angelica, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a hollow stem and a distinctive, aromatic odor. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds with a tuft of silky hairs. Peucedanum ostruthium is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators."
