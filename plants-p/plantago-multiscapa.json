    "intro": "Plantago multiscapa, commonly known as the common plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a rosette of broad, oval, slightly hairy leaves that are typically green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
