    "intro": "Phaeostoma modestum, commonly known as the modest brown moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green to brownish-green foliage. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a distinct costa that extends to the apex. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in forest understories. This moss is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions due to its desiccation tolerance."
