    "intro": "Puya recurvata, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a member of the bromeliad family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces tall, showy inflorescences with numerous red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are thick and fibrous, adapted to the cold, dry conditions of its native habitat. Puya recurvata is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades."
