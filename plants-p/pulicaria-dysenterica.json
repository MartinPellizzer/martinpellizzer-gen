    "intro": "Pulicaria dysenterica, commonly known as yellow sandwort, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. Pulicaria dysenterica is adapted to withstand drought and temperature extremes, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
