    "intro": "Pilea johnstonii subsp. johnstonii, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are round and glossy, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
