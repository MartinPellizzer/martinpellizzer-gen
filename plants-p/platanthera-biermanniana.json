    "intro": "Platanthera biermanniana, commonly known as the Biermann's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraled inflorescence composed of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
