    "intro": "Prangos microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that grows in rocky and arid environments, often found in elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,500 meters. The plant features a robust taproot system and produces tall, slender stems with large, pinnately compound leaves. Its most distinctive feature is its showy, yellowish-green inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, petal-less flowers clustered in dense spikes. Prangos microcarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
