    "intro": "Prunus autumnalis, commonly known as the sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow to orange in the fall, adding ornamental value to the landscape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by edible, tart red berries that attract wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Prunus autumnalis is valued for its hardiness and ability to provide both ecological and aesthetic benefits in gardens and natural habitats."
