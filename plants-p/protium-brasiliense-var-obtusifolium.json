    "intro": "Protium brasiliense var. obtusifolium, commonly known as the Brazilian wild tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves with rounded tips. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody capsules containing smooth, kidney-shaped seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a milky sap when wounded. This species is valued for its ecological role and has limited use in traditional medicine."
