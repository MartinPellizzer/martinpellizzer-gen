    "intro": "Picea mariana, commonly known as the white spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its silvery-white bark, which becomes fissured with age. The needles are short, flat, and bluish-green, often with two white stomatal lines on the upper surface. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. This species is adapted to cold climates and is commonly found in boreal forests and subarctic regions."
