    "intro": "Peniocereus zopilotensis, commonly known as the Zopilote cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a low-growing cactus with a globular or cylindrical stem, often covered in white or pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
