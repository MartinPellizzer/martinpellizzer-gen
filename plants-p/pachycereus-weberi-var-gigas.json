    "intro": "Pachycereus weberi var. gigas, commonly known as the giant columnar cactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 15 meters, making it one of the tallest cacti in the world. The plant has thick, ribbed stems that store water efficiently, adapted to its arid environment. Its spines are short and dense, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. The flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom at the top of the stems during the warmer months."
