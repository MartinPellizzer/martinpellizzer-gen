    "intro": "Poa leptocoma var. reflexa, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, often curved blades with a distinctive reflexed (bent backward) appearance at the base, which is a key identifying trait. The plant typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, lawns, and disturbed areas. Its small, spike-like inflorescences contain numerous tiny flowers, and it is adapted to thrive in cool, humid climates. Due to its fine texture and ability to form a dense turf, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping."
