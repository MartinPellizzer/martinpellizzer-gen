    "intro": "Platycarpum schultesii var. zarucchii, commonly known as the Zarucchii flat-fruit, is a rare tropical plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its unique floral and fruit structures. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, followed by distinctive flat, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
