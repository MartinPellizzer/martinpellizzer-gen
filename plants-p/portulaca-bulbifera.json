    "intro": "Portulaca bulbifera, commonly known as the swollen bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is notable for its unique ability to produce bulb-like structures called bulbils, which can develop into new plants. These bulbils are often found at the base of the leaves, aiding in vegetative propagation. Portulaca bulbifera thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy and resilient species."
