    "intro": "Pedicularis borgeanii, commonly known as the Borgean's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces showy, hooded flowers that are typically pink or red, with a distinctive bilabiate structure. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
