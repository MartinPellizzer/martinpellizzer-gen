    "intro": "Platylepis australis, commonly known as the Australian flatleaf heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in heathlands and coastal areas, characterized by its dense, low-growing form. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Platylepis australis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
