    "intro": "Pyrus calleryana var. calleryana, commonly known as Chinese white ash, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by clusters of round, yellow fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively disease-resistant. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seedlings."
