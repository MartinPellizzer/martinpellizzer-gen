    "intro": "Panicum hirtum, commonly known as hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
