    "intro": "Pulicaria alata, commonly known as the hairy fleabane, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features finely hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pulicaria alata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
