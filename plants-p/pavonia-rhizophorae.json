    "intro": "Pavonia rhizophorae, commonly known as the mangrove pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is typically found in brackish or saltwater environments, often growing in association with mangrove forests. The plant has small, clustered pink or red flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Pavonia rhizophorae plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
