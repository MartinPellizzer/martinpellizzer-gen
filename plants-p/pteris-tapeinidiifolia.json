    "intro": "Pteris tapeinidiifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in dense forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
