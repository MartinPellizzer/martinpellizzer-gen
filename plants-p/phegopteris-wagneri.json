It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically divided into multiple segments, giving it a feathery appearance. Phegopteris wagneri thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks."
