    "intro": "Pennisetum sclerocladum, commonly known as stiff-leaved fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are stiff and pointed. The plant produces delicate, fluffy seed heads that give it a feathery appearance, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it both drought-tolerant and visually striking in landscapes."
