    "intro": "Prunus grayana var. fargesii, commonly known as the Farges plum or the Chinese plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its striking clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, often turning a vibrant yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible but generally not cultivated for consumption. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
