It belongs to the family Palmae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
