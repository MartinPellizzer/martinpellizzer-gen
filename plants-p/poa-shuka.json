    "intro": "Poa shuka, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that reflects the harsh alpine environment. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize the soil. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow spikelet cluster, which is often adorned with bristly hairs. Poa shuka is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra ecosystems."
