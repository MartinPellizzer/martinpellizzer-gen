    "intro": "Pyrus uva-ursi, commonly known as bearberry or stonecrop, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a whitish waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for wildlife. Pyrus uva-ursi thrives in rocky, acidic soils and is often found in open woodlands or alpine areas. Its hardy nature and unique appearance make it a notable species in its native habitats."
