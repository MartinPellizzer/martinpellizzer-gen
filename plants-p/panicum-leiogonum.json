    "intro": "Panicum leiogonum, commonly known as silky panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that cover the leaves and inflorescence, giving it a soft, delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering spikes are slender and drooping, producing small, pale green to brownish flowers. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
