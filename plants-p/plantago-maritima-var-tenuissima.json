    "intro": "Plantago maritima var. tenuissima, commonly known as sea plantain or narrow-leaved plantain, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are borne on erect, branching stems. It is often found in salt marshes, dunes, and other coastal habitats. Its ability to thrive in harsh, windy conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
