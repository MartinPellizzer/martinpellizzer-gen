    "intro": "Plantaginorchis plantaginea, commonly known as the white marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a loose spike, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in peat bogs and along the edges of water bodies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
