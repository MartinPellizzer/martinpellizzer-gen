    "intro": "Parakohleria, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Parakohleria thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fallow fields. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in many regions."
