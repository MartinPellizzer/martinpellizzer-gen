    "intro": "Polystichum lobatopinnulum, commonly known as the broad-lobed wood fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, intricately divided fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
