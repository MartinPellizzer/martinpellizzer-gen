    "intro": "Picea abies f. nigra, commonly known as the black spruce, is a naturally occurring form of the Norway spruce. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and dense, conical shape. The foliage consists of short, sharp needles that are typically dark green, and it produces small, woody cones. This subspecies is native to northern Europe and is often found in boreal forests. It is well adapted to cold climates and is relatively slow-growing, making it a long-lived tree species."
