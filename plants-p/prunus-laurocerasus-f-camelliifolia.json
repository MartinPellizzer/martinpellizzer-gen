    "intro": "Prunus laurocerasus f. camelliifolia, commonly known as the Camellia-leaved laurel, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that resembles the leaves of camellia plants, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. Its slow growth and attractive appearance make it a popular choice for hedging and specimen planting."
