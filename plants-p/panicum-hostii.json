    "intro": "Panicum hostii, commonly known as the Mexican feather grass, is a perennial grass native to Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery plumes that sway gracefully in the wind. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a light green color that adds a soft texture to gardens. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
