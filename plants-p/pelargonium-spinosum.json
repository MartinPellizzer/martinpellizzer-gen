    "intro": "Pelargonium spinosum, commonly known as the spiny geranium, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features hairy, spiny stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, typically during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its spines serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores, while its compact growth habit makes it an attractive ornamental plant."
