    "intro": "Perreymondia viridis, commonly known as the green perreymondia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with deep green, leathery leaves that are oval in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Perreymondia viridis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and air-purifying properties."
