It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, red berries that persist through winter. Phillyrea terminalis is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
