    "intro": "Polypodium membranaceum var. grandifolium, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bi-directionally compound, with pinnae that are often broader and more robust than those of the typical variety."
