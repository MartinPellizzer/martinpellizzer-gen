    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 microlepis, commonly known as the hybrid Japanese shield fern, is a fern species native to East Asia. It is a hybrid between Polystichum setiferum and Polystichum hirtum, resulting in a plant with distinctive fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with finely divided, serrated leaflets that give the plant a lush, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens. The plant's botanical features make it a popular choice for shady garden beds and woodland landscapes."
