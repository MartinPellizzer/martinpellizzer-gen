    "intro": "Peperomia circinnata var. orbicularis, commonly known as the rounded peperomia, is a compact, low-maintenance plant native to tropical regions. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive foliage and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardens and terrariums."
