    "intro": "Pittoniotis, commonly known as the Greek bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the Campanulaceae family. It consists of several species, primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. The plants are herbaceous perennials, often characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. They typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to dry, sunny environments. Pittoniotis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their delicate blooms."
