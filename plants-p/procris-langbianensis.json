    "intro": "Procris langbianensis, commonly known as the Langbian spider orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, wiry flower spikes. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Procris langbianensis is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
