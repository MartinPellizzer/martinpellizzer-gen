    "intro": "Persea obtusifolia, commonly known as the Mexican persimmon, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, pear-shaped berry that turns from green to orange when ripe. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and its edible fruit, which has a sweet, honey-like flavor."
