    "intro": "Polypodium \u00d7 leucosporum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a hybrid fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-white to grayish-green fronds, which are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and indoor settings."
