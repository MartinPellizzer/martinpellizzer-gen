It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, adapting to the unique conditions of the tepui ecosystems. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often displaying shades of white or pale pink. Due to its restricted habitat, Pochota tepuiensis is considered a rare and endemic species."
