    "intro": "Peperomia diaphana f. minor, commonly known as the miniature peperomia, is a compact, trailing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and hanging baskets."
