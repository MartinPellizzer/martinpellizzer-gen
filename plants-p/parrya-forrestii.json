    "intro": "Parrya forrestii, commonly known as the Forest's parrya, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a small, herbaceous plant with delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
