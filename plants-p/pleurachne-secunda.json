    "intro": "Pleurachne secunda, commonly known as the narrowleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Pleurachne secunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
