    "intro": "Parodia lychnosa, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to produce vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months. The plant has a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Parodia lychnosa is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
