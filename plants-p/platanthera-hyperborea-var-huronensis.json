    "intro": "Platanthera hyperborea var. huronensis, commonly known as the Huron bog orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in wet, acidic bogs across the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the low-nutrient environments it inhabits. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
