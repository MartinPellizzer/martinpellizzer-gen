    "intro": "Poterium trigynum, commonly known as the three-lobed spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought conditions. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces a milky sap that can be toxic. Poterium trigynum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
