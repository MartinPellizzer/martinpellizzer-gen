    "intro": "Pistacia terebinthus var. oxycarpa, commonly known as the Armenian turpentine tree, is a variant of the terebinth tree native to the eastern Mediterranean and parts of the Middle East. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and rocky environments. The plant is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, leathery leaves that are alternate along the stems. Its fruit is a small, woody drupe that contains a single seed, and it produces a resinous sap used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh climates and its historical significance in local ecosystems."
