    "intro": "Polygala fimutu, commonly known as the Fimutu milk-vetch, is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, bean-like seed pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polygala fimutu is considered a rare and endangered species."
