    "intro": "Poinciana elatior, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and has a spreading canopy with pinnate leaves."
