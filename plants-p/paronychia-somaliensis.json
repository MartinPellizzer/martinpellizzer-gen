    "intro": "Paronychia somaliensis, commonly known as the Somali paronychia, is a flowering plant native to the dry regions of Somalia and neighboring areas. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, though it is not closely related to them. The plant is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the dry season. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils or in crevices. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine in its native regions."
