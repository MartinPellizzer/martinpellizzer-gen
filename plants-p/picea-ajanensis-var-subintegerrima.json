    "intro": "Picea ajanensis var. subintegerrima, commonly known as the Andean white pine, is a rare and endemic conifer found in the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its distinctive, long, needle-like leaves that are typically white or pale blue underneath. The cones of this variety are small and typically pendulous, maturing to release seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of high-altitude ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
