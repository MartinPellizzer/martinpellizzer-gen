    "intro": "Polygala lindheimeri var. parvifolia, commonly known as the Lindheimer's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. It is a member of the Polygalaceae family, which includes many species with showy, often spiny flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
