    "intro": "Paris franchetiana, commonly known as the Chinese basket fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
