    "intro": "Pollinia, commonly known as pollen masses, are specialized structures found in certain flowering plants, particularly in orchids. They consist of compact, sticky masses of pollen grains that are often enclosed in a cohesive sheath. These structures are adapted for efficient pollination by insects or other pollinators. The unique morphology of pollinia allows for precise transfer to the stigma of compatible flowers. Botanically, they represent an advanced adaptation in the reproductive strategy of some plant species."
