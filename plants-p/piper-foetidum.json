    "intro": "Piper foetidum, commonly known as the skunk vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its stems are often covered in a sticky, aromatic resin that can emit a strong, unpleasant odor. This resin has been used traditionally in some regions for its medicinal properties."
