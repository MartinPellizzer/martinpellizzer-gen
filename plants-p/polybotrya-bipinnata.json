    "intro": "Polybotrya bipinnata, commonly known as the two-lobed fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. Its reproductive structures are borne on the underside of the fronds, forming spore-producing clusters called sori. Polybotrya bipinnata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
