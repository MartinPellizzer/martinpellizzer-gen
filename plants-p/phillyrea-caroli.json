    "intro": "Phillyrea caroli, commonly known as the Carpathian phillyrea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Balkan Peninsula. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant has simple, narrow leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, spherical berries. Phillyrea caroli is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature."
