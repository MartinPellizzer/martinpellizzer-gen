    "intro": "Papaver nordhagenianum, commonly known as the Nordhagen poppy, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family, which includes various species of poppies known for their showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers with a distinctive, spurred corona, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
