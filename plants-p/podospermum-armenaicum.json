    "intro": "Podospermum armenaicum, commonly known as Armenian velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and showy blue-violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the small, winged seeds. Podospermum armenaicum is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
