    "intro": "Protium riedelianum, commonly known as the Riedel's pimento, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single, large seed. Its latex, which is milky and sticky, has been used traditionally for its adhesive properties. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its potential economic uses."
