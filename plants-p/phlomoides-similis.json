    "intro": "Phlomoides similis, commonly known as the narrowleaf false panicgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and prairies, and is often found in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a subject of study in ecological and taxonomic research."
