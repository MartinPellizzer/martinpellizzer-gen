    "intro": "Piper pexum, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a peppery taste. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
