It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic growth habit. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color, with a distinctive hood-like structure.

Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
