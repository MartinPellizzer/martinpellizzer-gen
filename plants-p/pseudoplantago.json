    "intro": "Pseudoplantago, commonly known as false plantain, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Plantaginaceae. It consists of several species that are typically found in temperate regions, often in moist or wet habitats such as marshes and meadows. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and slender, often hairy stems. The flowers are usually small and clustered in dense inflorescences, and they are adapted for wind pollination. Pseudoplantago species are often used in ecological restoration due to their ability to stabilize soil and thrive in disturbed environments."
