    "intro": "Polystichum subacutidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and landscapes."
