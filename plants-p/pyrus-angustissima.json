It is native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit, a small pear-like berry, is edible but not commonly cultivated for commercial use. Pyrus angustissima is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks."
