    "intro": "Phoradendron globuliflorum, commonly known as the globular-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, white or greenish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the host tree's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. This species is native to parts of Central and South America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates."
