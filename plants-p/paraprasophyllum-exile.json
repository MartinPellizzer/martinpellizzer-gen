It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and sorrel species. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
