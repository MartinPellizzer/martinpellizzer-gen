    "intro": "Phlox multiflora var. depressa, commonly known as the creeping phlox, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features dense clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that range from pink to purple, blooming in early to mid-summer. The plant has trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form a dense mat. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are evergreen in mild climates. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens."
