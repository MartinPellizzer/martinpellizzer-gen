    "intro": "Polypodium alfaroi, commonly known as the Alfaroi shield fern, is a species of polypody found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its intricate, fern-like fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Polypodium alfaroi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
