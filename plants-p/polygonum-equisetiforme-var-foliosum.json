    "intro": "Polygonum equisetiforme var. foliosum, commonly known as the creeping knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant has small, opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense spikes, and typically appear in late summer. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain environments."
