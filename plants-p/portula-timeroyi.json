    "intro": "Portula timeroyi, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Portula timeroyi is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
