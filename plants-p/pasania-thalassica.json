    "intro": "Pasania thalassica, commonly known as the sea pasania, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, thriving in saline and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid coastal environment. Pasania thalassica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens for its resilience and aesthetic qualities."
