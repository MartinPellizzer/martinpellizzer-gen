    "intro": "Pelargonium fragile, commonly known as the brittle geranium, is a delicate flowering plant native to South Africa. It features small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. The plant has slender stems and narrow leaves, which give it a refined appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its fragile nature, it is often cultivated in containers to protect it from harsh weather conditions."
