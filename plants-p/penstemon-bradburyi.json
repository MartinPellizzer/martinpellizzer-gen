    "intro": "Penstemon bradburyi, commonly known as Bradbury's beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to red. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces numerous seed capsules that disperse its seeds effectively. Penstemon bradburyi is often cultivated in xeriscapes due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
