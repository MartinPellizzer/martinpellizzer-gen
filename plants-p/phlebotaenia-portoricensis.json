    "intro": "Phlebotaenia portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and covered in a layer of wax. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or decaying wood in tropical and subtropical regions. Its simple morphology lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and it reproduces via spores released from specialized structures called sporophytes. Phlebotaenia portoricensis plays a minor but ecologically significant role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitat."
