    "intro": "Poa bulbosa var. verticillata, commonly known as the clustered bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that form dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically held in a compact, rounded cluster. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental and low-maintenance landscaping."
