It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related trees. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, often with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pescatoria wallisii is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
