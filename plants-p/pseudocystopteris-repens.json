    "intro": "Pseudocystopteris repens, commonly known as the running fern, is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that allow it to spread across the forest floor. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they are often covered in small, scale-like structures. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in moist woodlands or along stream banks. The plant's reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its ability to propagate effectively in its habitat."
