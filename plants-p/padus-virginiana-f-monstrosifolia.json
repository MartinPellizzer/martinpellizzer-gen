    "intro": "Padus virginiana f. monstrosifolia, commonly known as the showy white crabsbark, is a rare and striking variant of the common crabsbark. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that appear in late spring, making it a notable ornamental plant. The plant is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, wooded areas. Its foliage is often larger and more lobed than the typical species, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
