    "intro": "Panicum helopus f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth panicgrass, is a variant of the panicum species characterized by its reduced hair coverage on its foliage. This plant is a grass-like perennial that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It features slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The inflorescence consists of a loose panicle made up of small, two-lobed spikelets. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-maintenance conditions."
