    "intro": "Pleopeltis lepidopteris, commonly known as the silver-veined rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves with distinctive silver veins. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of hair, which helps in moisture retention. The fronds are usually pinnately divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
