    "intro": "Pinus altaica, commonly known as the Siberian pine, is a coniferous tree native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically bundled in groups of five. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, mountainous environments. The Siberian pine is also valued for its timber and has cultural significance in some regions."
