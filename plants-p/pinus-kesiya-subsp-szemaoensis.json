It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its long, slender needles and cone-bearing structure. The plant exhibits typical gymnosperm features, including vascular tissue and the absence of true flowers. Its foliage is adapted to high-altitude environments, with needle-like leaves reducing water loss. This subspecies plays a significant role in the ecological systems of its native habitat, providing habitat and contributing to soil stabilization."
