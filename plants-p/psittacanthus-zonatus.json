    "intro": "Psittacanthus zonatus, commonly known as the zoned arrowhead, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically green with distinct white or yellow markings. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and ponds. Its leaves are submerged or floating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures. Psittacanthus zonatus is valued in aquariums for its ornamental appearance and ability to improve water quality."
