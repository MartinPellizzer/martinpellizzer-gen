    "intro": "Pteris rochfordii, commonly known as the Rochford's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically borne on long, creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Pteris rochfordii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
