It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, primarily found in Peru and Bolivia. This tree is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
