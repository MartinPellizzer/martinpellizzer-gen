It features tall, slender stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple or silver at the base. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy, purple or pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and showy inflorescences."
