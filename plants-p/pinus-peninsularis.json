    "intro": "Pinus peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The tree has slender, needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in bundles of five. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
