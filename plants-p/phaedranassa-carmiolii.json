    "intro": "Phaedranassa carmiolii, commonly known as the Carmiolii's ghost orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and striking, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghosts, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing epiphytically on trees in the understory of tropical forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Phaedranassa carmiolii is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
