    "intro": "Poa jansenii, commonly known as Jansen's bentgrass, is a species of grass native to South America, particularly Chile. It is a low-growing perennial plant that typically forms dense, mat-like turf. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
