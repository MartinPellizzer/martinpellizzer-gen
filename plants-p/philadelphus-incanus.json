    "intro": "Philadelphus incanus, commonly known as the silver-leaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely textured, silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking contrast to its showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow blossoms in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often covered in a whitish bloom, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Philadelphus incanus is relatively low maintenance and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens."
