    "intro": "Potentilla agrivaga, commonly known as the wandering potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically features wiry stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is drought-tolerant and hardy, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry landscapes. Potentilla agrivaga is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
