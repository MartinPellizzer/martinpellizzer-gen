    "intro": "Populus simonii var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf poplar, is a variant of the poplar tree native to China. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, which are followed by distinctive samaras, or winged seeds, for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and mountainous regions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
