It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, narrow leaves. The plant produces inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers, which are typically yellow or green in color. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and for thatching due to their fibrous texture. The plant thrives in humid, coastal environments and is adapted to grow in sandy or limestone soils."
