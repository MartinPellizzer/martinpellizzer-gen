    "intro": "Packera franciscana, commonly known as the San Francisco leafcup, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the end of each leaf stalk. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is typically found in coastal bluffs and dunes. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
