    "intro": "Procris gibbosa, commonly known as the cushion lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments. It has a distinctive crustose to foliose thallus with a pale green to yellowish-green color. The plant forms dense, cushion-like growths on rock surfaces, soil, or tree bark. It is widely distributed in temperate regions and is often found in shaded, humid habitats. Procris gibbosa plays a vital role in ecological systems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
