    "intro": "Pachycereus tetetzo, commonly known as the Mexican giant hedgehog cactus, is a columnar cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid environments. Its slow growth rate and ability to store water in its stems make it well adapted to desert conditions."
