    "intro": "Pleurothallis aphthosa, commonly known as the red-lipped pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree branches or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive red lip, which is a key feature for attracting pollinators. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it thrives in high-altitude regions with consistent temperatures. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
