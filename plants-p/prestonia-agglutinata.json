    "intro": "Prestonia agglutinata, commonly known as the sticky prestonia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, known for its showy, often fragrant flowers. The plant produces a sticky, milky sap that can be toxic if ingested. Its leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
