    "intro": "Ptilotus sandwicensis var. kavaiensis, commonly known as the Kauai ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pink to reddish bract-like flowers. The plant typically thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native habitat. It has fibrous roots and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Hawaii."
