    "intro": "Platanthera nanlingensis, commonly known as the Nanling orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
