    "intro": "Penstemon gairdneri, commonly known as Gairdner's beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in dense spikes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Penstemon gairdneri is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
