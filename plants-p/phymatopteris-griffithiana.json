    "intro": "Phymatopteris griffithiana, commonly known as the Griffith's fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor firmly in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
