    "intro": "Potentilla exsul, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has wiry, branched stems and pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor soils and with minimal water. Potentilla exsul plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native range."
