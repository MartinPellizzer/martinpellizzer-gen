    "intro": "Papaver pasquieri, commonly known as the Pasquier's poppy, is a rare and striking species of the Papaver genus. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in areas of Kazakhstan and southern Siberia. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often with a dark central blotch. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
