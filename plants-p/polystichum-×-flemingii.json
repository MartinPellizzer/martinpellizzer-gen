    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 flemingii, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between *Polystichum acrostichum* and *Polystichum milleflorum*. It is a hardy evergreen fern that thrives in shady, moist environments, typically found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant features long, arching fronds with a dark green, leathery texture and a distinctive, glossy appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable offspring and is propagated through division of its rhizomes."
