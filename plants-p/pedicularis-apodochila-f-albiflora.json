    "intro": "Pedicularis apodochila f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is distinguished by its notably white floral coloration, setting it apart from other forms of Pedicularis."
