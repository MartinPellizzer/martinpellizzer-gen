It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fluffy, purple-tinted seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in open fields and along roadsides. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more vibrant in the autumn. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
