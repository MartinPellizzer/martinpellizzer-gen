    "intro": "Peucedanum lundense, commonly known as Swedish cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to northern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs such as parsley and carrots. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in meadows and woodland edges. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in umbrella-like clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, ribbed bur, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals."
