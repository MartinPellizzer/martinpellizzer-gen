    "intro": "Parinari boivinii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it useful in cabinet-making and furniture production. Parinari boivinii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests."
