    "intro": "Pouzolzia ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf pouzolzia, is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed or open habitats. The leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and are usually arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color, followed by small, three-lobed berries. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
