    "intro": "Polypodium triglossum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, finger-like segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Polypodium triglossum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
