    "intro": "Pyracantha discolor, commonly known as the variable firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that range in color from dark green to reddish-brown. The plant produces clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds but are considered toxic to humans and livestock. Pyracantha discolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly for its vibrant winter berries and thorny structure."
