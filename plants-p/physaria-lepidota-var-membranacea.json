It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and hairy, succulent leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seed pods are distinctive, containing numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is well-suited to sandy and rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
