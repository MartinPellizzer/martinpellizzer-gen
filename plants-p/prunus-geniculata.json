    "intro": "Prunus geniculata, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or yaezakura, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, oval berries that turn red when mature, and its leaves are ovate with a smooth, glossy surface. Prunus geniculata is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and is also valued in traditional Japanese culture. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for garden landscapes in temperate climates."
