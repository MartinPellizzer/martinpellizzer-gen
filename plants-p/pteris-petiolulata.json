    "intro": "Pteris petiolulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often borne on long, slender petioles. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Pteris petiolulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
