    "intro": "Panicum cinereovestitum, commonly known as silver panicum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces fluffy, pale green to brown seed heads that are often wind-dispersed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common ornamental in landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it useful for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
