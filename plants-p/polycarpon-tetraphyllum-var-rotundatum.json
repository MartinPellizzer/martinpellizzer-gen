    "intro": "Polycarpon tetraphyllum var. rotundatum, commonly known as the roundleaf four-leaf plant, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
