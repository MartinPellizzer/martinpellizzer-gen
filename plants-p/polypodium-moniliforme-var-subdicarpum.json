It is characterized by its dark, glossy fronds that resemble the appearance of holly leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for decorative purposes in gardens."
