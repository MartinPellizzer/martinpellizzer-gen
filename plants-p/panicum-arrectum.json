    "intro": "Panicum arrectum, commonly known as stiff panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and stiff, bristly leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces fluffy, tan or brown seed heads that are often used as decorative elements in gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread via rhizomes make it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural settings."
