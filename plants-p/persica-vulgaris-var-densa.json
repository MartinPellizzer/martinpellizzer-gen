    "intro": "Persica vulgaris var. densa, commonly known as the dense peach. This variety is a less common cultivar of the peach tree, characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. It typically produces small, firm fruits with a sweet and tangy flavor. The leaves are dark green and glossy, while the flowers are white with a slight pink tinge. It is often grown in smaller spaces due to its bushy form and is valued for both its ornamental appeal and edible yield."
