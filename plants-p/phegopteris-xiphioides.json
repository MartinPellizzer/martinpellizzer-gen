    "intro": "Phegopteris xiphioides, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along rocky or shaded areas. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, narrow shape and a serrated margin. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops."
