    "intro": "Plocoglottis bicomata, commonly known as the two-lobed fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into two lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Plocoglottis bicomata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
