    "intro": "Pecteilis finetiana, commonly known as the Mexican flame violet, is a striking member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with contrasting yellow throats. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. Pecteilis finetiana is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
