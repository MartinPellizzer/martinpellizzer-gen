    "intro": "Piptatheropsis exigua, commonly known as the dwarf pincushion cactus, is a low-growing succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features dense clusters of small, spiny stems that form a cushion-like shape, often reaching heights of only a few inches. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in arid environments. Piptatheropsis exigua is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping."
