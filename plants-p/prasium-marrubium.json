    "intro": "Prasium marrubium, commonly known as greater horehound, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a square, hairy stem that grows upright, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Prasium marrubium is known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat respiratory and digestive ailments."
