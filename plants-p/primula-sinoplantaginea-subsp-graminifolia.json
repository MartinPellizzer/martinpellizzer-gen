    "intro": "Primula sinoplantaginea subsp. graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-leaved primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowering period occurs in early spring, making it a notable species in high-altitude botanical communities. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and ecological adaptation to harsh mountainous conditions."
