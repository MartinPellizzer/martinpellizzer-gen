    "intro": "Phelypaea armena, commonly known as Armenian water clover, is a species of aquatic plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It thrives in freshwater environments such as streams and ponds, often growing in shallow, shaded areas. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Phelypaea armena is notable for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and is often used in aquatic gardening. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
