It features thick, glossy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or red, depending on the variety. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and container planting."
