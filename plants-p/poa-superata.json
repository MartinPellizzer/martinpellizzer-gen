    "intro": "Poa superata, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, awnless lemmas. Poa superata plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
