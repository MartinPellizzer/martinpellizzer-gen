    "intro": "Polypodium anisopterum, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnate fronds with a unique combination of lobed and serrated leaflets. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, spongy layer that aids in water retention. Polypodium anisopterum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
