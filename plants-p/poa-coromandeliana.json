    "intro": "Poa coromandeliana, commonly known as the Coromandel grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern coast of India. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, making it a monoecious species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Poa coromandeliana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
