    "intro": "Pedicularis campestris subsp. heterodonta, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive bilaterally symmetrical shape. Pedicularis campestris subsp. heterodonta is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants through specialized root structures."
