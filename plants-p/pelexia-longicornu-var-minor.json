    "intro": "Pelexia longicornu var. minor, commonly known as the lesser horned pelexia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Native to specific regions of southern Europe, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils and shaded woodland environments. The plant's unique morphology, including its elongated, horn-like stipules, distinguishes it from other members of the genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
