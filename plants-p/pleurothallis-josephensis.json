    "intro": "Pleurothallis josephensis, commonly known as the Joseph's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted to the humid and shaded conditions of its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
