    "intro": "Pyrus communis f. pseudocydonia, commonly known as the Persian white pear, is a cultivar of the European pear that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is distinguished by its large, white fruit with a smooth, almost skinless texture, which sets it apart from typical pears. The plant produces a tall, upright tree with dense foliage and robust growth habits. Its flowers are usually white and clustered, contributing to its ornamental value. This form is valued both for its fruit quality and its aesthetic appeal in horticultural settings."
