    "intro": "Penstemon fruticiformis, commonly known as the prickly penstemon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and spiny stems, which provide structural support and deter herbivores. The plant produces vibrant blue to violet tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its botanical features make it an attractive and hardy addition to native plant landscapes."
