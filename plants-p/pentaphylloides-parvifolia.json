    "intro": "Pentaphylloides parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved pentaphylloids, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a spiral pattern along its slender stems. The plant produces tiny, pale green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in humid forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
