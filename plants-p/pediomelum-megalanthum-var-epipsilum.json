It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a capsule fruit containing numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
