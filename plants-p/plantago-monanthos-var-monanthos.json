    "intro": "Plantago monanthos var. monanthos, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces a tall, erect flowering stem topped with a dense cluster of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. Its leaves are commonly used in traditional medicine for their soothing and anti-inflammatory properties."
