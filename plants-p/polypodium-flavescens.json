    "intro": "Polypodium flavescens, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium flavescens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in both wild and cultivated settings."
