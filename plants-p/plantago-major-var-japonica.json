    "intro": "Plantago major var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese plantain, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface and a prominent central vein. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, gardens, and disturbed areas. This variant is closely related to the common plantain but exhibits distinct morphological characteristics adapted to its native environment."
