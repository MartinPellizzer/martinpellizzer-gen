    "intro": "Paphiopedilum insigne var. madouxianum, commonly known as the Madouxi's slipper orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, boat-shaped lip and vibrant green leaves with a waxy texture. This plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. It produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
