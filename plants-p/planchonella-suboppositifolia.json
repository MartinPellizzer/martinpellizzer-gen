    "intro": "Planchonella suboppositifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandpaper tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lanceolate, opposite leaves that are rough to the touch due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by edible, fleshy berries that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland forest areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
