    "intro": "Petrocodon lui, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Tibet and Nepal. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Petrocodon lui is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
