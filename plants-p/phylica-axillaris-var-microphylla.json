    "intro": "Phylica axillaris var. microphylla, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its profuse display of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in winter. The leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in whorls around the stems, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This plant is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
