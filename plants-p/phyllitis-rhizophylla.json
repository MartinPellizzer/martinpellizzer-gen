    "intro": "Phyllitis rhizophylla, commonly known as the red fern, is a unique fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive red-tinged fronds and a specialized growth habit where the fronds grow directly from the roots. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, contributing to its limited distribution. The plant's morphology and habitat make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora."
