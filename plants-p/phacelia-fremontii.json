It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss. Phacelia fremontii is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its role in supporting pollinators."
