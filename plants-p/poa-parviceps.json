It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, upright culms with narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which are small and usually pale green to brown in color.
