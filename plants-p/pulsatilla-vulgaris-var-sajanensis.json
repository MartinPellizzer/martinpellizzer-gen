    "intro": "Pulsatilla vulgaris var. sajanensis, commonly known as the Sajansky pasqueflower, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tien Shan and Pamir ranges. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
