    "intro": "Paepalanthus heterotrichus, commonly known as the velvetleaf cactus, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the dry season, typically in the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss and deter herbivores. Paepalanthus heterotrichus is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in regions with low rainfall."
