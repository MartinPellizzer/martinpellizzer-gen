    "intro": "Podocarpus rumphii, commonly known as the Java pine, is a tropical evergreen conifer native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange-red aril. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Podocarpus rumphii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
