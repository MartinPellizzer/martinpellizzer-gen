    "intro": "Palmijuncus subangulatus, commonly known as the narrow-angled palm, is a unique member of the Arecaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and narrow, elongated leaves that form a fan-like shape. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, which are followed by elongated, spiny fruits. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its distinctive morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
