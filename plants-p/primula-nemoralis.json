    "intro": "Primula nemoralis, commonly known as the wood anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions of Europe. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, lobed leaves and produces clusters of delicate, white, five-petaled flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in woodland habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies, contributing to its role in early season pollination networks. The species is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in suitable environments."
