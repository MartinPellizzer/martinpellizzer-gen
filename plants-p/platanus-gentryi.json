    "intro": "Platanus gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Platanaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, mottled bark that peels in thin layers. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that contain tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal of its seeds. Its leaves are palmately lobed and turn yellow in the fall before dropping. Platanus gentryi is often found in moist, well-drained soils near rivers and streams."
