    "intro": "Potentilla alba f. obovata, commonly known as white potentilla or snowberry, is a frost-tolerant shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are ovate to obovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stems. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate flowers and compact growth habit."
