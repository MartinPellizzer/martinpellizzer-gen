    "intro": "Phlox multiflora subsp. multiflora, commonly known as wood phlox, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to purple flowers in the spring, which bloom in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Wood phlox is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to naturalize in woodland settings."
