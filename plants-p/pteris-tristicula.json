    "intro": "Pteris tristicula, commonly known as the three-veined water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. The fronds are used in traditional medicine in some regions for their purported health benefits."
