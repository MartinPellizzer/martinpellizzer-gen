    "intro": "Phymatodes prominula, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits that contain seeds with silky hairs for wind dispersal. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Phymatodes prominula plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
