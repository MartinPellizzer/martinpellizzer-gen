    "intro": "Potentilla albifolia, commonly known as the whiteleaf cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with finely divided, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Potentilla albifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
