    "intro": "Prunus wildeniana, commonly known as the wild cherry or wild almond, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and has slender, often twisted branches. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip. Its flowers are white or pale pink, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, sweet-smelling fruits that are edible but have a bitter almond taste. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
