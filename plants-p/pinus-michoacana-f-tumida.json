    "intro": "Pinus michoacana f. tumida, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Michoacan pine. It is characterized by its dense, scaly bark and short, stiff needles that give it a unique appearance. This subspecies is native to the highlands of central Mexico, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Its cones are typically small and have a distinctive, rounded shape. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
