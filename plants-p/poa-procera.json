    "intro": "Poa procera, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has tufted growth habit with slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green color, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa procera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its fine texture and resilience."
