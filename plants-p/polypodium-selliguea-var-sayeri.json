    "intro": "Polypodium selliguea var. sayeri, commonly known as the Sayer's polypody, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. This variety is closely related to other polypody species and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
