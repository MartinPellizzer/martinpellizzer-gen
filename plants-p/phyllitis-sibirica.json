    "intro": "Phyllitis sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian water clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the cold climates of Asia and Europe. It features small, kidney-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wet meadows and stream banks. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic properties."
