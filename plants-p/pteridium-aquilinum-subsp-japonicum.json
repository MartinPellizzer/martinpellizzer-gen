    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum subsp. japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese bracken, is a fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds. The species is also notable for its ability to form dense colonies, which can dominate vegetation in certain ecosystems."
