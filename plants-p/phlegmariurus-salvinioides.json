    "intro": "Phlegmariurus salvinioides, commonly known as the salmon liver moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is a thalloid plant characterized by a flat, ribbon-like structure with a smooth, green upper surface and a darker, often reddish underside. This moss typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are small and often embedded within the thallus. Phlegmariurus salvinioides plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat."
