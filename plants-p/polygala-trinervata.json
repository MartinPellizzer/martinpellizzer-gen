It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinct three-veined structure, which is a notable botanical feature. The flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and the plant produces small, bead-like fruits that contain seeds."
