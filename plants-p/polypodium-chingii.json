It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky substrates. Polypodium chingii is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
