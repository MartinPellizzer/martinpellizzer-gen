    "intro": "Phillyrea angustifolia var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Phillyrea, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It has small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter, sometimes whitish underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, spherical berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is often found in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This variety is noted for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
