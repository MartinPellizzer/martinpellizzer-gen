    "intro": "Petrophytum acuminatum, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert plains. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Petrophytum acuminatum is well adapted to survive in harsh desert climates with minimal water availability."
