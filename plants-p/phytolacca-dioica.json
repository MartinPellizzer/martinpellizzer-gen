    "intro": "Phytolacca dioica, commonly known as Indian currant, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
