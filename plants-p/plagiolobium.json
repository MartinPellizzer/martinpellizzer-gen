    "intro": "Plagiolobium, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive butterfly-shaped leaves, which are often lobed and have a striking appearance. Plagiolobium species typically produce small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. These plants are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
