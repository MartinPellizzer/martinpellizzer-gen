    "intro": "Picea nigra var. fastigiata, commonly known as the narrowleaf black spruce, is a compact, columnar evergreen conifer native to North America. It has slender, dark green needles that are closely packed along its upright branches. The plant produces small, cone-like seed structures that contain winged seeds, typical of the conifer family. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in boreal forests and high-elevation areas. Its slow growth rate and dense form make it a valuable ornamental and ecological plant in suitable climates."
