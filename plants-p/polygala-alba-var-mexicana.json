    "intro": "Polygala alba var. mexicana, commonly known as white milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are opposite and linear, often with a slight pubescence, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
