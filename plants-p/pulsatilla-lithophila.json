It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are basal, with a distinctive wavy or toothed margin. Pulsatilla lithophila is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a rare and specialized species."
