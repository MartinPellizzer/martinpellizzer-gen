    "intro": "Podocarpus neriifolius var. penibukanensis, commonly known as the Penibukan ebony, is a rare evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green in color. It produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, this species is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
