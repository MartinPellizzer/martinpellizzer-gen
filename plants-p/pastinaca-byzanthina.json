It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and purple-tinged flower heads. The plant produces small, spiky fruits that are adapted for animal dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Its historical use in traditional medicine is noted for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
