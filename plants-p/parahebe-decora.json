    "intro": "Parahebe decora, commonly known as the decorative parahebe, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, compact growth with glossy, dark green foliage that remains attractive throughout the year. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
