    "intro": "Peucedanum rhombifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved angelica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, rhomboid-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Peucedanum rhombifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in mountainous regions."
