    "intro": "Poa macedonica var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Macedonian grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Balkan region. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with fine, soft leaves that are often less than 10 cm in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its decorative value."
