It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its woody structure and showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant produces large, fleshy fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a thick, fleshy aril. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
