    "intro": "Picris, commonly known as goat's beard, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their feathery, yellow or greenish-yellow flowers that resemble a beard, hence the common name. They are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and many species are found in dry, open habitats. Picris species are often herbaceous, with linear leaves and can grow from 30 to 120 centimeters tall. They are sometimes used in traditional medicine and have been studied for their potential pharmacological properties."
