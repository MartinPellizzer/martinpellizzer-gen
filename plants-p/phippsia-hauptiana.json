    "intro": "Phippsia hauptiana, commonly known as the Schomburgk's paphiopedilum, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow with purple and green markings. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild."
