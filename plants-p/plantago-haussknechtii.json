    "intro": "Plantago haussknechtii, commonly known as the Haussknecht's plantain, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
