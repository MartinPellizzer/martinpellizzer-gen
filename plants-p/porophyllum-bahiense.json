    "intro": "Porophyllum bahiense, commonly known as the Bahia sunflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
