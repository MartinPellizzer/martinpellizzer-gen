    "intro": "Pedicularis szetschuanica subsp. szetschuanica, commonly known as the Chinese lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its distinctive appearance and ecological role make it an important species in alpine ecosystems."
