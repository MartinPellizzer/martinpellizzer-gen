    "intro": "Prunus padus fructu-albescente, commonly known as the white-fruited bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive white or pale yellow fruits that mature in late summer. The fruits are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream valleys."
