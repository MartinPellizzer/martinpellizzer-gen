    "intro": "Panicum nitidum var. crassifolium, commonly known as broadleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are typically glabrous or nearly so, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and disturbed sites. Its adaptability makes it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
