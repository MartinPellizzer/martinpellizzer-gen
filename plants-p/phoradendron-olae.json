    "intro": "Phoradendron olae, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native Hawaiian trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using limited chlorophyll. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, contributing to the ecological balance of Hawaiian forests. Phoradendron olae is an important component of the island's unique flora and has cultural significance in Hawaiian traditions."
