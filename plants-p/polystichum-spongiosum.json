    "intro": "Polystichum spongiosum, commonly known as the sponge fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, feathery fronds that are covered in a spongy, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Polystichum spongiosum is valued both for its ornamental appearance and its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
