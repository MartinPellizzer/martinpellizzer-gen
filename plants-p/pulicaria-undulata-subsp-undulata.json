    "intro": "Pulicaria undulata subsp. undulata, commonly known as the undulate synthyris, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in compact, spherical heads, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
