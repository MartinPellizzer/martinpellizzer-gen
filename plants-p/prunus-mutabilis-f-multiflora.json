    "intro": "Prunus mutabilis f. multiflora, commonly known as the multiflora cherry, is a compact, deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from red to black as they mature, attracting birds and other wildlife. Its foliage is typically dark green, with serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
