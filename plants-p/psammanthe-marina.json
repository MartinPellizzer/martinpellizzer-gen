    "intro": "Psammanthe marina, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by water and wind. Psammanthe marina is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
