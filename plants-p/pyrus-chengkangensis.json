    "intro": "Pyrus chengkangensis, commonly known as the Chengkang pear, is a rare species of pear native to China. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped fruits with a smooth, thin skin that turns yellow when ripe. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions and prefers well-drained soils. Its leaves are broad and dark green, often with a slightly serrated edge. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
