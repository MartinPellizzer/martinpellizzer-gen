    "intro": "Portulaca diptera, commonly known as the two-winged moss rose, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a succulent species with fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its stem is erect and branched, often growing up to 30 centimeters in height. Portulaca diptera is adapted to hot, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
