It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Pycnocoma thonneri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
