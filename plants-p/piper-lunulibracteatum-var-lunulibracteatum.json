    "intro": "Piper lunulibracteatum var. lunulibracteatum, commonly known as the moon-leaf pepper, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that often have a waxy coating and a unique, moon-shaped leaf base. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into elongated, cylindrical fruits. Its botanical features include a climbing habit, opposite leaf arrangement, and the presence of glandular hairs on the stems and leaves. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
