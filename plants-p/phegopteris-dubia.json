    "intro": "Phegopteris dubia, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris dubia is often found in montane and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
