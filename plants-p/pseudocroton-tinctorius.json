    "intro": "Pseudocroton tinctorius, commonly known as the red-leaved croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage that ranges from deep red to yellow and green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are followed by woody, spiny capsules containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens with adequate light and care."
