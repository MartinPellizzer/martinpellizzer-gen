    "intro": "Pentalepis, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plants are characterized by their tall, slender stems and clusters of small, delicate flowers that often display vibrant colors. Pentalepis species typically grow in rocky or mountainous environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. Their unique morphology and ecological niche make them an important subject of study in botanical research."
