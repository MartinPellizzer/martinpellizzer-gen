It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, feather-like fronds. Native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's rhizomatous structure allows it to spread and form dense clumps. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions."
