    "intro": "Potentilla cinerascens, commonly known as the ashleaf potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its grayish-white bark and small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in the wild."
