    "intro": "Pyretrum aphyllon, commonly known as the leafless pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, with flowers emerging directly from the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are rich in pyrethrins, natural compounds used as insecticides. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for cultivation in gardens and as a ornamental plant. Due to its chemical properties, it has been historically used in pest control and botanical research."
