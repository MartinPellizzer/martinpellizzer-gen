    "intro": "Poa laxa subsp. pruinosa, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to various regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, pubescent hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. Its adaptability and ornamental qualities make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
