    "intro": "Pilea anivoranensis, commonly known as the Madagascar pilea, is a rare and unique species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicately endangered species."
