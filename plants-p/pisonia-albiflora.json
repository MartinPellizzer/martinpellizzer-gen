    "intro": "Pisonia albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered pisonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its showy, white, clustered flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, a feature typical of many members of the Rubiaceae family. Its leaves are opposite and often have a slightly rough texture. Pisonia albiflora thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
