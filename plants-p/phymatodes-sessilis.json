    "intro": "Phymatodes sessilis, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Phymatodes sessilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
