    "intro": "Poa orcuttiana, commonly known as the Orcutt's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Poa orcuttiana is often found in alpine and arid regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
