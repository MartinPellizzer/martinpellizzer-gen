    "intro": "Potentilla eriocarpoides, commonly known as the downy cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant features small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered with a fine, white down that gives it a soft appearance. The fruit is a hairy, five-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, contributing to its spread in natural environments."
