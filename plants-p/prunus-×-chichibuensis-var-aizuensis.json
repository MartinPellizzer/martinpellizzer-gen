    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 chichibuensis var. aizuensis, commonly known as the Aizu cherry, is a hybrid deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its elegant, single or double white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits known as cherries, though they are generally not as flavorful as those of other Prunus species. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. The Aizu cherry is also valued for its ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and providing habitat for wildlife."
