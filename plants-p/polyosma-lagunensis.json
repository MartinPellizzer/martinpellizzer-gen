    "intro": "Polyosma lagunensis, commonly known as the Guiana pipevine, is a climbing vine native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Aristolochiaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pipe-like flowers. The plant produces a strong, bitter odor to attract its primary pollinator, the pipevine swallowtail butterfly. Its roots contain alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. However, due to its toxic compounds, it is not recommended for cultivation or consumption."
