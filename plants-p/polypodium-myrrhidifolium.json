    "intro": "Polypodium myrrhidifolium, commonly known as the myrrh-leaf polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often tinged with a reddish hue, especially when young. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its fronds are usually pinnately divided, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in humid conditions. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
