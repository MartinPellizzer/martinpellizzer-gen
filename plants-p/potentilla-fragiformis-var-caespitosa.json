    "intro": "Potentilla fragiformis var. caespitosa, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense clusters of silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and arctic environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
