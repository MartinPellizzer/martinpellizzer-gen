    "intro": "Prunus pygeoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cherry, is a small deciduous shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in spring, followed by dark red or black berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Prunus pygeoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
