    "intro": "Pitcairnia exserta, commonly known as the \"Pitcairnia Sword\" or \"Pitcairnia exserta,\" is a striking bromeliad native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height, forming a rosette that holds water. The plant produces striking red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, often in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Pitcairnia exserta is a popular ornamental plant due to its dramatic appearance and ease of care."
