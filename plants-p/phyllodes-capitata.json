    "intro": "Phyllodes capitata, commonly known as the silky wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, hairless phyllodes that resemble leaves, though they are actually modified stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spherical heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Phyllodes capitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping."
