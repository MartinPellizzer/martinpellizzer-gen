    "intro": "Pepinia beachiae, commonly known as the beach pepinia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, succulent perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. Pepinia beachiae is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
