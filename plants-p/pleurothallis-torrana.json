    "intro": "Pleurothallis torrana, commonly known as the silver leaf orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually small and pale, often appearing in clusters during the rainy season. Pleurothallis torrana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
