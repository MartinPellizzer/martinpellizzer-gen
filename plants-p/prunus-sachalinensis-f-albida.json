    "intro": "Prunus sachalinensis f. albida, commonly known as the white-flowered sakura cherry, is a unique form of the Prunus sachalinensis species. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which contrast with the typical pink or red blooms of the standard species. This cultivar is native to Japan and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. The plant produces small, edible fruits similar to cherries, though they are less commonly consumed. It thrives in temperate climates and is prized for its aesthetic appeal during the spring blossom season."
