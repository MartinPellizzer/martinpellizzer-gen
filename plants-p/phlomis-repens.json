    "intro": "Phlomis repens, commonly known as carpet grass or creeping phlomis, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with dense mats of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flower clusters in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it ecologically valuable in arid environments."
