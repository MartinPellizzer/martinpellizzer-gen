    "intro": "Panicularia ramigera, commonly known as the slender panicled bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces delicate, panicled inflorescences composed of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. These flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
