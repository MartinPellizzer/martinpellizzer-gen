    "intro": "Phymatopteris hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawksbeard, is a fern species native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the spring and summer months. Phymatopteris hastata plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
