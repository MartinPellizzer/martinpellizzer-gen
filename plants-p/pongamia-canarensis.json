    "intro": "Pongamia canarensis, commonly known as the Indian beech, is a deciduous tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces woody pods that contain a viscous, oily seed pulp, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of biofuel. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in dry deciduous forests. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important species for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
