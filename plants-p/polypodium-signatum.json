    "intro": "Polypodium signatum, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically gray-green in color, with a distinctive silvery sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium signatum is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
