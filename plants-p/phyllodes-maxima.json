    "intro": "Phyllodes maxima, commonly known as the large-leaf waratah, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its large, flat, leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which are modified stems that perform the function of leaves. The plant produces striking red or pink floral spikes, often with a yellow or orange center, during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy and ornamental plant in coastal and dry regions. The phyllodes are typically leathery and have a prominent midrib, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
