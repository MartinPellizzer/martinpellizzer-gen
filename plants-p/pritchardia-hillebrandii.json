    "intro": "Pritchardia hillebrandii, commonly known as the Hillebrand's cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal habitats. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
