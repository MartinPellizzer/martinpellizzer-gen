    "intro": "Polypodium paulistanum, commonly known as the Brazilian wall fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often grow in dense clusters on rocky surfaces. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on cliff faces. Its rhizome is creeping and produces multiple shoots, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize various substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
