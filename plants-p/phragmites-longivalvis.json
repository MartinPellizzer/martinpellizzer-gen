    "intro": "Phragmites longivalvis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved common reed, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. This plant thrives in brackish or freshwater marshes, along shores, and in other moist soils. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife. The plant is often mistaken for other Phragmites species due to its similar appearance."
