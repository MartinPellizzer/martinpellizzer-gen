    "intro": "Pilosella kalksburgensis subsp. sublagara, commonly known as the Kalksburg hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
