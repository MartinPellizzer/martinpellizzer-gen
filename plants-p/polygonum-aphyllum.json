    "intro": "Polygonum aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its absence of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures along its stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Polygonum aphyllum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
