    "intro": "Patagonium parviflorum, commonly known as the Patagonian dwarf orchid, is a small, perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, white or pale yellow blooms during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the cold, windy conditions of its habitat. Patagonium parviflorum is a rare and endangered species, found only in specific microhabitats within the Andes."
