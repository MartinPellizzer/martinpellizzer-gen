    "intro": "Poa glauca, commonly known as bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to form dense mats, making it a common lawn grass. Poa glauca is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
