    "intro": "Psychotria megalocalyx, commonly known as the giant psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its large, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, red berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Due to its habitat requirements, it is often found in shaded, moist environments with high humidity."
