    "intro": "Pitcairnia taenipetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in its native habitat. The plant produces striking violet or purple inflorescences that bloom in the spring. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
