    "intro": "Phyllocephalum lilacinum, commonly known as the lilac-tinged fern, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are covered in a fine, waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in moist, forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
