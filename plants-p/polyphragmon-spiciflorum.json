    "intro": "Polyphragmon spiciflorum, commonly known as the spikeflower polyphragmon, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound umbels of small, white to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces a distinct, aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
