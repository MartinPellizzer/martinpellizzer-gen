    "intro": "Primula atuntzuensis, commonly known as the Atuntzu primrose, is a rare and endemic species native to the Pyrenees Mountains in Spain. It is a herbaceous perennial characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
