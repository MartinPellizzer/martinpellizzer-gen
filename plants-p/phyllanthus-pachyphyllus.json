    "intro": "Phyllanthus pachyphyllus, commonly known as the thick-leaved phyllanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal due to its distinctive foliage."
