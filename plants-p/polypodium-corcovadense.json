    "intro": "Polypodium corcovadense, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a tropical fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its fronds are typically divided into broad, lance-shaped segments with a distinctive, rough texture. Polypodium corcovadense thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories."
