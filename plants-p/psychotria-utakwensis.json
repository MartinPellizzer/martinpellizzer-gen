    "intro": "Psychotria utakwensis, commonly known as the Congo psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
