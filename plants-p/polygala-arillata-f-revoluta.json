    "intro": "Polygala arillata f. revoluta, commonly known as the curled-leaf milkvetch, is a rare and unique variant of the Polygala genus. It is characterized by its distinctive, rolled or curled leaves, which give it its specific epithet \"revoluta.\" The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, delicate flowers that are often pale blue or white in color. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements."
