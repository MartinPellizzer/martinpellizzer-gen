    "intro": "Peniocereus greggii, commonly known as the night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing cactus with cylindrical stems that are typically green and ribbed. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is well adapted to desert conditions, with spines that provide shade and reduce water loss."
