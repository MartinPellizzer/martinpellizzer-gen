    "intro": "Polypodium \u00d7 rothmaleri, commonly known as the Rothmaler\u2019s shield fern, is a hybrid fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, clump-forming growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often deeply divided. The plant produces spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
