    "intro": "Plantago barbata subsp. monanthos, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture and produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
