It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green berries that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. The plant has simple, opposite leaves with a rough texture and a distinct, aromatic scent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
