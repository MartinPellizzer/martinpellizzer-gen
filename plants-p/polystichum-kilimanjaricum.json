    "intro": "Polystichum kilimanjaricum, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
