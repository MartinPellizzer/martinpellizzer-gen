    "intro": "Petastoma truncatum, commonly known as the roughleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of rough, hairy leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in the spring, producing achenes that are dispersed by the wind. Petastoma truncatum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
