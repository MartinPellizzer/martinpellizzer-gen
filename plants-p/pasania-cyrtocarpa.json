    "intro": "Pasania cyrtocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-fruit pasania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glossy and dark green. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically clustered in cup-shaped structures called cyathia, a feature typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The fruit is a capsule that matures into a smooth, fleshy structure, which is also the source of its common name."
