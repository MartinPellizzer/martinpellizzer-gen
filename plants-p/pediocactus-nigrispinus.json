    "intro": "Pediocactus nigrispinus, commonly known as the black-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a compact, rounded stem that often develops a fluted appearance as it matures. The plant is characterized by its dark, spiny areoles and clusters of short, stiff spines that give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the areoles in late spring or early summer. Pediocactus nigrispinus is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem and minimizing water loss through its waxy surface."
