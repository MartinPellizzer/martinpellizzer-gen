    "intro": "Pseudaraeococcus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered snowball plant, is a species native to the southern United States. It is a low-growing shrub that produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and delicate floral display."
