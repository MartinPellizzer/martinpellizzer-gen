    "intro": "Pyrus sorbus var. maliformis, commonly known as the Malformis whitebeam, is a variant of the whitebeam tree native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, and often irregularly shaped leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in woodland habitats and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by white or pinkish berries in the autumn. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
