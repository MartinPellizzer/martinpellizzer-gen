It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a low-growing habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Native to Europe, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its unique feature is the single flower head that appears at the end of each stem, giving it its common name."
