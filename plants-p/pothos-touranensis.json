    "intro": "Pothos touranensis, commonly known as the Touranensis pothos, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically light to dark green, often with a slight variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by berries that mature to a bright red color. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often used as a houseplant due to its adaptability and low maintenance requirements. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and trail effectively, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or shelves."
