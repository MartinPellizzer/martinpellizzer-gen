    "intro": "Potentilla matsumurae var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and western China. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately divided into five lobes, with a hairy texture that becomes smoother as the plant matures. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and vibrant floral display."
