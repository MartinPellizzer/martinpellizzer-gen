    "intro": "Platanthera canarensis, commonly known as the Canary Island orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Canary Islands. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, erect stem and a single, showy, greenish-white flower. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
