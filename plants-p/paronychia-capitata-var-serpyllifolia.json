    "intro": "Paronychia capitata var. serpyllifolia, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a creeping rootstock with dense, prostrate stems that bear small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically silver-white or gray-green, covered in fine hairs that reflect light and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in small heads. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, arid environments."
