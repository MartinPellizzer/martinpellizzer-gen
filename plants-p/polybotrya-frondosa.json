    "intro": "Polybotrya frondosa, commonly known as the fronded polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often arching or cascading in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are usually green and may have a slight waxy coating, which helps in retaining moisture."
