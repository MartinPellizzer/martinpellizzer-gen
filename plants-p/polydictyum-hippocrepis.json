It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flower heads that resemble small holly berries, surrounded by bracts. The plant is native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and thrives in saline and well-drained soils. Its leaves are fern-like, with a feathery appearance, and the flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. Polydictyum hippocrepis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
