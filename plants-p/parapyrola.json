    "intro": "Parapyrola, commonly known as the rock lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Iridaceae. It consists of several species native to southern Africa, particularly in rocky and arid environments. The plants are characterized by their grass-like foliage and showy, often fragrant flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Parapyrola species are typically short-lived perennials, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. They are popular in rock gardens and dry landscapes due to their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
