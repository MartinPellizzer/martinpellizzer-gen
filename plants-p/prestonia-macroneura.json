    "intro": "Prestonia macroneura, commonly known as the giant spider orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble spiders, with intricate patterns and vibrant colors. The plant produces long, thin stems and has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
