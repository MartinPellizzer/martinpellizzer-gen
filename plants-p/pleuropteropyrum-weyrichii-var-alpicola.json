    "intro": "Pleuropteropyrum weyrichii var. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine pleuropteropyrum, is a rare and specialized plant species found in high-altitude environments. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and in alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink, adapting to the harsh climatic conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
