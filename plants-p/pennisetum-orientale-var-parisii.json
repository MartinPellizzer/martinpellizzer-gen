    "intro": "Pennisetum orientale var. parisii, commonly known as the Parisii fountain grass, is a striking ornamental grass native to southern Europe. It features slender, arching blades of fine, silver-green foliage that create a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces delicate, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that range in color from pale pink to deep red, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice in xeriscaping and modern garden designs."
