    "intro": "Psednotrichia newtonii, commonly known as the Newton's feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to tolerate periodic flooding."
