    "intro": "Psittacanthus chrismarii, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense ground covers. Its leaves are dimorphic, with sterile fronds appearing in the spring and fertile fronds developing later in the season. Psittacanthus chrismarii is well adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodland environments."
