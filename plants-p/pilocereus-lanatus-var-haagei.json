    "intro": "Pilocereus lanatus var. haagei, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a flowering cactus species native to South America. It is characterized by its unique appearance, featuring a brightly colored, swollen stem known as a \"pseudostem\" that is actually a grafted section of another cactus species. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of white, yellow, or pink. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor settings."
