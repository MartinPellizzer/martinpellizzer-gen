    "intro": "Polystichum aquifolium, commonly known as the water holly fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dark green, bi-pinnate fronds that are often covered with a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream sides, where it can receive consistent moisture. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing year-round interest in the landscape."
