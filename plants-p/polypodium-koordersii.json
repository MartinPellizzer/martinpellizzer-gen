    "intro": "Polypodium koordersii, commonly known as the koord's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments such as mountain forests and rock crevices. The fronds are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its natural habitat."
