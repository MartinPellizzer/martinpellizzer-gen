    "intro": "Parodia thieleana, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a thick, fleshy stem that stores water. The plant typically has a vibrant, colorful top that sits atop a green, chlorophyll-rich base, which allows it to photosynthesize. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters during the warmer months. Parodia thieleana is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
