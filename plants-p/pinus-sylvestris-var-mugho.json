    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. mugho, commonly known as the Siberian pine, is a variant of the Scots pine that is native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its short, thick trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The needles are typically shorter and stiffer compared to those of the standard Scots pine, and they are arranged in pairs. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
