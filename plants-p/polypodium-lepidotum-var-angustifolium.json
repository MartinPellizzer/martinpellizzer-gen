    "intro": "Polypodium lepidotum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wall-ruffle, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Polypodium lepidotum."
