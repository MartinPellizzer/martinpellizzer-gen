    "intro": "Poa pratensis subsp. rigens, commonly known as rigid meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted foliage, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is a common component of grassland ecosystems."
