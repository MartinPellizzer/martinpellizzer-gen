It is characterized by its large, white, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces latex-containing capsules that contain alkaloids such as morphine and codeine. Its botanical features include smooth, lobed leaves and a tall, erect stem. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is subject to strict legal regulation in many countries."
