    "intro": "Parietaria indica, commonly known as the stinging nettle or Indian nettle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white underside, and it produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. Its leaves and stems contain irritant hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact. Parietaria indica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
