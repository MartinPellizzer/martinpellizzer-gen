    "intro": "Potentilla rivalis, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its hardy nature. Potentilla rivalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or alpine landscapes."
