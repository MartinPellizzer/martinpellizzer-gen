It features long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem, with the leaves often appearing to be perforated at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
