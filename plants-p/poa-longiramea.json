    "intro": "Poa longiramea, commonly known as the long-bracted bentgrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
