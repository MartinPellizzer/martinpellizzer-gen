    "intro": "Parathelypteris glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered with small, glandular dots. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in wet soil. The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
