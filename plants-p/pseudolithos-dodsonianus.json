It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with fleshy, stone-like leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens and arid landscapes."
