    "intro": "Plantago alpestris, commonly known as the alpine plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate and alpine regions. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, rocky slopes, and mountainous areas. Plantago alpestris is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its soothing effects on the respiratory and digestive systems."
