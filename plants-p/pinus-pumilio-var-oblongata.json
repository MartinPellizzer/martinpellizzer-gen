    "intro": "Pinus pumilio var. oblongata, commonly known as the dwarf mountain pine, is a variant of the whitebark pine native to the high elevations of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, conical shape and dense foliage, which helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The leaves are typically needle-like, short, and often persist for several years before shedding. This variant exhibits a unique growth habit, forming compact clumps rather than spreading out. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold, windy environments with poor soil."
