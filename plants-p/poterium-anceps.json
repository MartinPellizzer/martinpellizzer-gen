It features a rosette of gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a cylindrical inflorescence. Poterium anceps is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It is considered a valuable plant in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
