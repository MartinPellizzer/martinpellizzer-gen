    "intro": "Physalis pedunculata, commonly known as the winter cherry or golden berry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant orange, lantern-shaped fruits that enclose the seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are yellow with a distinctive purple calyx, which later becomes the papery husk surrounding the fruit. The fruit matures in late summer to early autumn and is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its tart flavor and nutritional value."
