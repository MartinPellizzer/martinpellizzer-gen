It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and dense covering of fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
