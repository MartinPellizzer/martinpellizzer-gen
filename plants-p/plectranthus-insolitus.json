    "intro": "Plectranthus insolitus, commonly known as the wild mint or African violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental flowers make it both a useful medicinal plant and an attractive ornamental species."
