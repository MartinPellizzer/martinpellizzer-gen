    "intro": "Pandanus laferrerei, commonly known as the New Caledonian pandanus, is a species of palm native to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that grow in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by fibrous, spiky fruits. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native region. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
