    "intro": "Peliosanthes longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved peliosanthes, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is a small palm tree characterized by its slender trunk and elongated, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers arranged in compound inflorescences, followed by edible, elongated fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
