    "intro": "Pleurothallis salpingantha, commonly known as the \"flower of the mountain,\" is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The flowers bloom during the dry season, making it a notable species in its ecological niche."
