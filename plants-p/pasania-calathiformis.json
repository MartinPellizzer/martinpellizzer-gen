    "intro": "Pasania calathiformis, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped leaves that form a dense, cradle-like structure around the central growing point. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which release spores for reproduction. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and indoor plant collections."
