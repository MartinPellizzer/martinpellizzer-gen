    "intro": "Pleurothallis chlorina, commonly known as the green pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and vibrant green foliage, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. The flowers are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Its botanical significance lies in its role within the diverse orchid flora of the Neotropics."
