    "intro": "Phymatosorus grossus, commonly known as the giant cliff brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliff faces, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Phymatosorus grossus is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient and distinctive member of the fern flora."
