    "intro": "Paeonia corallina var. kesrouanensis, commonly known as the Kesrouan peony, is a rare and endemic species native to Lebanon. It is characterized by its distinctive coral-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has deeply lobed, compound leaves that are typically green with a slight hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
