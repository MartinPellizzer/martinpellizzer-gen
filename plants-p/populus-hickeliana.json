    "intro": "Populus hickeliana, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada balsam poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and mountainous areas. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
