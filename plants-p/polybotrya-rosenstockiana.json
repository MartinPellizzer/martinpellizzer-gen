    "intro": "Polybotrya rosenstockiana, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps over time. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, with a deep green color that remains throughout the year. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
