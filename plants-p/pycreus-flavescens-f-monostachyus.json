    "intro": "Pycreus flavescens f. monostachyus, commonly known as the single-stemmed yellow bellflower, is a rare botanical variant of the Pycreus flavescens species. It is characterized by its slender, single-stemmed growth habit and bright yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to specific regions in southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. This unique form is of particular interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and limited distribution."
