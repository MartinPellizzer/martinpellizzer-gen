    "intro": "Panicum pallens var. swartzii, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a variant of the panic grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. This grass thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its growth habit is clump-forming, with upright, slender stems that produce small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
