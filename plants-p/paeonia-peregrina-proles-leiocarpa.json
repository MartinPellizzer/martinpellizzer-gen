    "intro": "Paeonia peregrina proles leiocarpa, commonly known as the white peony, is a rare and striking member of the\u828d\u836f\u79d1 (Paeoniaceae) family. It is characterized by its large, white, single blooms that resemble roses, with finely divided, fern-like leaves. Native to the mountainous regions of central Asia, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers typically appear in late spring to early summer, and it is noted for its ornamental value in gardens. However, due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
