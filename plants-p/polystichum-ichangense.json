    "intro": "Polystichum ichangense, commonly known as the Ichang fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments, often found in forests and mountainous regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in lines along the pinnae. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
