    "intro": "Poa andina, commonly known as Andean bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Poa andina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
