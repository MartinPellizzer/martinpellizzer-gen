    "intro": "Paspalum stellatum, commonly known as stargrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and distinctive inflorescence that resembles a star, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, including marshes and along streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets. Paspalum stellatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
