    "intro": "Parsonsia pinetorum, commonly known as the pine tree lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are often orange or red in color, with a distinctive tubular shape. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid climates. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral displays."
