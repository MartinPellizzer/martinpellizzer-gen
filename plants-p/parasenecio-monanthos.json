This plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant's striking appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and botanical collections. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important subject in ecological and horticultural studies."
