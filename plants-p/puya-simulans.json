    "intro": "Puya simulans, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is a member of the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 10 feet in height. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often form a rosette at the base, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Puya simulans is known for its slow growth and can live for several decades, making it a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
