It features slender, branched stems that grow up to 60 cm tall, often with a hairy texture. The leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and arranged alternately along the stem. It produces spikes of blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.
