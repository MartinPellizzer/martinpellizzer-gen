It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse display of yellow flowers in early summer. The plant typically features small, oval leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
