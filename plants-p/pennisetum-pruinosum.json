    "intro": "Pennisetum pruinosum, commonly known as purple fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and fluffy, purple-tinted plumes that appear in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance. Pennisetum pruinosum is also valued for its ability to attract birds and butterflies."
