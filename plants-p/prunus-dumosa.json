    "intro": "Prunus dumosa, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or rock cherry, is a small shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, oval leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible berries that are dark red when mature. Prunus dumosa thrives in rocky soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs and slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
