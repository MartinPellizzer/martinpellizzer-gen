    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum var. glabrum, commonly known as the bracken fern, is a widely distributed fern species characterized by its large, triangular fronds. It thrives in temperate and subtropical regions, often colonizing disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has a short, stout rhizome that produces numerous stolons, allowing it to spread rapidly. Its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its successful reproduction. The leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, serrated margin."
