    "intro": "Pandanus humilior, commonly known as the low pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its robust, fibrous leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that eventually develop into edible, fibrous fruits. Its roots are often used in traditional crafts and construction due to their strength and durability. Pandanus humilior thrives in wet, coastal environments and is often found in mangrove forests or near freshwater sources."
