    "intro": "Pleurothallis tomtroutmanii, commonly known as Tomtroutman's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree branches or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized orchid species."
