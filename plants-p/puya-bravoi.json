    "intro": "Puya bravoi, commonly known as the Andean torch, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant produces vibrant red and orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its rosette of broad, waxy leaves stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Puya bravoi is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to full sun with minimal water requirements."
