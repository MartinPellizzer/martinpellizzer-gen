    "intro": "Ptelea tortuosa, commonly known as the box elder or winged bean, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets, which are often serrated and have a distinctive wing-like appearance on the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged fruits that resemble samaras, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in moist, open habitats. Ptelea tortuosa is also valued for its hardy nature and adaptability to different environmental conditions."
