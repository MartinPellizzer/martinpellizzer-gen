    "intro": "Petrorhagia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Petrorhagia glomerata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
