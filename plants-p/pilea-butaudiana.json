    "intro": "Pilea butaudiana, commonly known as the Butaud's begonia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with silver and green patterns. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink, which appear in clusters during the spring. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among plant enthusiasts and collectors."
