    "intro": "Polypodium melanorhachis, commonly known as the black-stemmed shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are thick and often covered in a dense layer of roots. The spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
