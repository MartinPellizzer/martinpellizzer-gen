    "intro": "Prosopis tamaulipana, commonly known as the Tamaulipan mesquite, is a drought-tolerant shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northeastern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small leaflets, and it is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of forage for livestock."
