It features small, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
