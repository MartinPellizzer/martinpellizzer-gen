    "intro": "Poa fendleriana var. longiligula, commonly known as the long ligule fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, with the distinctive long ligule giving it its botanical name. This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
