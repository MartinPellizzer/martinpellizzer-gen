    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare subsp. serratum, commonly known as the serrated wall fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows on rocky walls, tree trunks, and in shaded forest environments. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds with serrated edges, which give it its common name. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shaded conditions."
