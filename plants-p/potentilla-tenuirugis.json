    "intro": "Potentilla tenuirugis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has dark green, narrow leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Potentilla tenuirugis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
