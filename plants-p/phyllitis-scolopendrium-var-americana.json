    "intro": "Phyllitis scolopendrium var. americana, commonly known as the American holly fern, is a variant of the common holly fern native to eastern North America. It is a perennial fern characterized by its distinctive, leathery, evergreen fronds that remain throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments with a serrated edge. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest ecosystems."
