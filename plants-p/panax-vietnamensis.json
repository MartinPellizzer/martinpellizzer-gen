    "intro": "Panax vietnamensis, commonly known as Vietnamese ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, branched root system and dark green, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and red berries, which are typical of its genus. It is valued for its potential medicinal properties, similar to other ginseng species. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
