    "intro": "Phyteuma brevifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved phyteuma, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia and parts of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing clusters of pale blue to violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture, and it prefers well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Phyteuma brevifolium is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ease of care."
