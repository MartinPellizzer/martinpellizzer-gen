    "intro": "Populus nigra f. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved black poplar, is a variant of the black poplar native to Europe. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 15 cm in length. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and in wetlands. This variety is valued for its ecological role and historical use in timber production."
