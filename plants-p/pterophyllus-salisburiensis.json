    "intro": "Pterophyllus salisburiensis, commonly known as the Salisburian fern, is a rare and ancient species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of a traditional fern, though it exhibits unique structural adaptations to its harsh environment. The plant thrives in cool, moist microclimates, often growing in rocky crevices or shaded forest floors. Its reproductive structures are concealed within specialized leaf sheaths, a feature that aids in protecting its spores from environmental stress. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disturbance, it is considered a conservation concern."
