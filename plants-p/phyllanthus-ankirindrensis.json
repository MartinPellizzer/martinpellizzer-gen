It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in inflorescences, which are typically surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
