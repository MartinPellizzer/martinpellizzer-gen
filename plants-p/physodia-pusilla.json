    "intro": "Physodia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf nightshade, is a small herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and tobacco. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, featuring small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pale purple flowers. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, turn from green to red as they mature. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in moist, shaded woodlands."
