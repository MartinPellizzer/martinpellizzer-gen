It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Psoralea brachypus is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
