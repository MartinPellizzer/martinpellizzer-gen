    "intro": "Pimpinella arguta, commonly known as wild carrot or bishop's weed, is a biennial or annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in umbels. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, carrot-like odor and is often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and waste areas. Its seeds are small, dry, and have a tuft of fine hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Pimpinella arguta is valued in herbal medicine for its potential digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
