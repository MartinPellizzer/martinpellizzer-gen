It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in racemes during the spring and summer months. Its distinctive feature is the hairy, bristly appearance of its leaves and stem, which gives it its common name. Pleroma pogonantherum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
