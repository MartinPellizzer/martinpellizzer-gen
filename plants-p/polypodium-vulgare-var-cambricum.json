    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare var. cambricum, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of Europe. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are typically bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, which is a characteristic feature of ferns. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
