    "intro": "Phaseolus parabolicus, commonly known as the parabolic bean, is a climbing legume native to South America. It produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, curved pods containing several seeds. The plant is characterized by its robust vines and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Phaseolus genus. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its edible seeds. The parabolic bean is notable for its unique pod shape, which is parabolic in form, giving it its common name."
