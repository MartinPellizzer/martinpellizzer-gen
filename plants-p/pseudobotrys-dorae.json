    "intro": "Pseudobotrys dorae, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it can receive adequate light without direct sun exposure. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky or humus-rich soils. Pseudobotrys dorae is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
