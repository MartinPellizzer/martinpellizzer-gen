    "intro": "Potentilla hirta subsp. taurica, commonly known as the Crimean cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and forest-steppe habitats. The plant features small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
