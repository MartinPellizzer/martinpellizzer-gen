    "intro": "Pleurogramme graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-like water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like fronds that are often submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant typically grows in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, where it can anchor itself to rocks or other substrates. Its rhizomes are wiry and help in spreading across the water surface. The fronds are usually dimorphic, with fertile and sterile shoots differing in structure and appearance."
