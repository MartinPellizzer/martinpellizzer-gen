    "intro": "Platanthera hologlottis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale greenish-white flowers and lack of leaves, relying entirely on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant is epiphytic, growing on the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understory of forests. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
