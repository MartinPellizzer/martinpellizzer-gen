    "intro": "Phryne subulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved phryne, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It features slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a valued species in native gardens and conservation efforts."
