    "intro": "Paederia prainii, commonly known as the red-flowered paederia, is a tropical climbing vine belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, showy red flowers that are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Paederia prainii is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in forest understories where it thrives in partial shade."
