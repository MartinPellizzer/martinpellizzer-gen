    "intro": "Pteris cretica var. cartilagidens, commonly known as the cartilaginous sword fern, is a variant of the common sword fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are broader and more robust than those of the typical Pteris cretica. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces erect, fan-shaped fronds with a dark green, almost metallic sheen. It prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
