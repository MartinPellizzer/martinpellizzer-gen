    "intro": "Prunus acuminata, commonly known as the Chinese wild apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by small, yellowish fruits that are edible but not commonly cultivated for commercial use. Prunus acuminata is often found in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
