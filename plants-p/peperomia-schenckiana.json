    "intro": "Peperomia schenckiana, commonly known as the Schenck's peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a prominent midrib, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia schenckiana is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
