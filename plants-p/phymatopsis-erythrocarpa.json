It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in limestone soils. Phymatopsis erythrocarpa is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
