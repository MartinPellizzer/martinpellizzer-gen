    "intro": "Phoradendron acinacifolium f. microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, berry-like fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy berries. This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its forest habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife."
