It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or brown in color. Its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. Polia arenaria plays an important ecological role in maintaining the integrity of coastal ecosystems."
