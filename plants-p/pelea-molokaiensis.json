It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for preservation efforts."
