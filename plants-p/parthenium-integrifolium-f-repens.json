    "intro": "Parthenium integrifolium f. repens, commonly known as the creeping ironweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spherical heads. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with smooth margins, and it is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The species is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to colonize various environments."
