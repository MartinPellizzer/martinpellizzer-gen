    "intro": "Panicum graniticum, commonly known as granite grass, is a species of grass native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, often found on slopes and in disturbed areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains of pollen. Due to its resilience and low water requirements, Panicum graniticum is often used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
