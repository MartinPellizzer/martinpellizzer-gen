    "intro": "Polypodium rufidulum, commonly known as the rusty maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a reddish or rusty underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium rufidulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
