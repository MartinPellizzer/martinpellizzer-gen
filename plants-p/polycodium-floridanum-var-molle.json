    "intro": "Polycodium floridanum var. molle, commonly known as the Florida polycodium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and pine flatwoods. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, creeping stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
