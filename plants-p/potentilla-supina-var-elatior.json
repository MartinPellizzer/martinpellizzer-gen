    "intro": "Potentilla supina var. elatior, commonly known as the tall trailing cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or small colonies. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
