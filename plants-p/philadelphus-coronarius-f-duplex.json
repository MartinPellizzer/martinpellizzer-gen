    "intro": "Philadelphus coronarius f. duplex, commonly known as the double-flowered weigela, is a cultivar of the weigela plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, double blooms that consist of numerous petal-like structures, giving it a more elaborate appearance than the typical single-flowered variety. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
