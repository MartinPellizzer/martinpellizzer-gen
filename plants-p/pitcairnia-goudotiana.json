    "intro": "Pitcairnia goudotiana, commonly known as the Goudot's pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the humid forests of South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common adaptation among bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with showy, brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss and provide some protection against herbivores. Pitcairnia goudotiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
