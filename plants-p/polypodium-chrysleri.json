    "intro": "Polypodium chrysleri, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Polypodium chrysleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
