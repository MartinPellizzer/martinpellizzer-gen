    "intro": "Popowia orophila, commonly known as the mountain popowia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and open slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Popowia orophila is considered a rare and endangered species."
