    "intro": "Prunus incisa var. tomentosa, commonly known as the Japanese maple or tomentosa maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense, grayish-white pubescence, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its unique foliage and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to horticultural collections."
