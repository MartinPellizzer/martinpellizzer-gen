It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as broccoli and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, bright green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and moderately deep, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Parabarium utile is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
