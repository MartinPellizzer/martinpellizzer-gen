    "intro": "Potentilla grandiflora var. dubia, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its hairy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically reaches a height of 10\u201330 cm and features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
