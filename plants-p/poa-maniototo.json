    "intro": "Poa maniototo, commonly known as the Maniototo grass, is a native New Zealand plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is a perennial herb with slender, tufted stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream margins. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa maniototo plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
