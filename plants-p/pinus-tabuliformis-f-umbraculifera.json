    "intro": "Pinus tabuliformis f. umbraculifera, commonly known as the Umbrella Pine, is a unique variant of the Chinese pine. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown formed by closely spaced, short, and often curved branches. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in fascicles of five, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. This form is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its compact and aesthetically pleasing shape. It prefers well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
