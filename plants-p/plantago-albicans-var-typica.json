    "intro": "Plantago albicans var. typica, commonly known as the white plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This species is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
