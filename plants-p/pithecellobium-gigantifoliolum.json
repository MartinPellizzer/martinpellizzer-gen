    "intro": "Pithecellobium gigantifoliolum, commonly known as the giant-leaf pithecellobium, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and potential nutritional benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
