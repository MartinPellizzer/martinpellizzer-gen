    "intro": "Petrocodon rubiginosus, commonly known as the red-stained rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, fleshy leaves and produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its scientific name reflects its reddish staining of the stems, which occurs when damaged. Petrocodon rubiginosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
