    "intro": "Podocarpus lambertii var. horsmanii, commonly known as the Horsman\u2019s podocarp, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, cone-like structures. The plant is typically found in coastal and lowland forests, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable component of New Zealand\u2019s native ecosystems. The species is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
