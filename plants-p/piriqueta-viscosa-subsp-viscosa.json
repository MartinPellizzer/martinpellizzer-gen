    "intro": "Piriqueta viscosa subsp. viscosa, commonly known as the sticky piriqueta, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, which helps in water retention and deterring herbivores. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a waxy cuticle, contributing to its drought tolerance. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy addition to xeriscapes."
