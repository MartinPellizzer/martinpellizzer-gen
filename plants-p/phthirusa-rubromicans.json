    "intro": "Phthirusa rubromicans, commonly known as the red-spotted blister beetle, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Meloidae. It is characterized by its elongated, somewhat cylindrical body and the presence of distinct red or orange spots on its exoskeleton. The plant aspect of this beetle is not directly relevant, as it is an insect rather than a plant. However, it is often found in association with certain plants, particularly those in the family Fabaceae. Its life cycle involves a parasitic larval stage that develops inside the bodies of host insects, typically beetles of the family Scarabaeidae."
