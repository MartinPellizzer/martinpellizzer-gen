    "intro": "Polyosma wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan rosewood, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, red berries. It is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of essential oils. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
