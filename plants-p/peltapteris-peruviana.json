    "intro": "Peltapteris peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian shield fern, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the order Psilophyta. It is characterized by its simple, branching structure and the presence of small, shield-like leaves. This fern-like plant thrived during the Carboniferous period, approximately 300 million years ago. Its fossils are often found in coal deposits, indicating its role in ancient forest ecosystems. The plant's morphology suggests it was adapted to swampy, low-light environments."
