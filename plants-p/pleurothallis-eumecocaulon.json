    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis eumecocaulon, commonly known as the golden-tipped pleurothallis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are small and often clustered, with a distinctive golden-yellow coloration on the petals and sepals. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
