    "intro": "Psathyrostachys fragilis subsp. secaliformis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish spikelets. This subspecies is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for forage and its genetic relationship to cultivated wheat species."
