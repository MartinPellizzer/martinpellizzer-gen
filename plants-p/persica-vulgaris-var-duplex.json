    "intro": "Persica vulgaris var. duplex, commonly known as the double-flowered peach. This variant is a cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its distinctive double flowers, which have multiple layers of petals instead of the typical single bloom. The botanical features include a deciduous tree with alternate, simple, ovate leaves and a fruit that is typically a fuzzy, yellow or red drupe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other peaches and cherries. The double-flowered trait is a result of genetic mutation, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
