It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and succulent, helping to conserve water. Psammophora herrei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing nectar for pollinators."
