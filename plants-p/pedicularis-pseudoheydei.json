    "intro": "Pedicularis pseudoheydei, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized roots. It typically grows in shaded, moist habitats and is often found in forest understories. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it a visually distinctive species within its ecosystem."
