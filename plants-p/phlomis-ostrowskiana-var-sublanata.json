    "intro": "Phlomis ostrowskiana var. sublanata, commonly known as the silky phlomis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flower spikes in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
