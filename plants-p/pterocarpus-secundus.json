    "intro": "Pterocarpus secundus, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. The tree is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
