    "intro": "Pilosella apatelia subsp. striifera, commonly known as the striped hairgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, leafy stems and small, yellowish flower heads that resemble dandelions. The subspecies is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine, branched hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which aid in its propagation across its native range."
