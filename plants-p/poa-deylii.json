    "intro": "Poa deylii, commonly known as the Deylii bluegrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Poa deylii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
