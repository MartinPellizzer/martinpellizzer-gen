    "intro": "Podolasia, commonly known as the rock fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. Podolasia species produce edible fig-like fruits that are often consumed by both humans and animals. These plants typically grow in rocky or disturbed soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
