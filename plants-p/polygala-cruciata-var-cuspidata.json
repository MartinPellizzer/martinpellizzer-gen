    "intro": "Polygala cruciata var. cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are narrow and often have a slight pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
