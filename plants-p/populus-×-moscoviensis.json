    "intro": "Populus \u00d7 moscoviensis, commonly known as the black poplar, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the white poplar (Populus alba) and the aspen (Populus tremula). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its dark, almost black bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-7 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins that release pollen in the spring, contributing to its role in wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Due to its fast growth and adaptability, it has been widely planted for reforestation and as an ornamental tree."
