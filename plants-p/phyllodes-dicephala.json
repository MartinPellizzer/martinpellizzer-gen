    "intro": "Phyllodes dicephala, commonly known as the two-headed wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique phyllodes, which are flattened, leaf-like structures that perform the function of true leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, typical of many wattles. Its phyllodes are usually narrow and have a distinctive two-headed appearance, giving the species its common name. It is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
