    "intro": "Ptelidium scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and slender, arching stems that often climb over other vegetation. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically clustered in spikelets, and it produces distinctive, three-lobed seeds. Ptelidium scandens thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories."
