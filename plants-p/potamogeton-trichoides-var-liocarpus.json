It features long, slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters, and it reproduces both sexually and asexually through rhizomes. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters with moderate to high light levels. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
