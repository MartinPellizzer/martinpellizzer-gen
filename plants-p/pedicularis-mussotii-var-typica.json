    "intro": "Pedicularis mussotii var. typica, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its unique morphology and coloration make it a notable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
