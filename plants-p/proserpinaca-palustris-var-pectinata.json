    "intro": "Proserpinaca palustris var. pectinata, commonly known as the broad-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features broad, flat, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure is well adapted to aquatic environments, with a fibrous root system that helps anchor it in soft, waterlogged substrates."
