    "intro": "Penstemon laetus subsp. roezlii, commonly known as the Roezli's beardtongue, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees."
