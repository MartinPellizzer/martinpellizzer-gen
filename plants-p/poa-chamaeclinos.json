    "intro": "Poa chamaeclinos, commonly known as the cushion grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern South America. It forms dense, low-growing mats that are often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its inflorescence consists of a cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed florets. Poa chamaeclinos is adapted to cold, dry conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems."
