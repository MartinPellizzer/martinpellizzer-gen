    "intro": "Papaver heldreichii var. sparsipilosum, commonly known as the sparse-hair poppy, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a vibrant touch to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
