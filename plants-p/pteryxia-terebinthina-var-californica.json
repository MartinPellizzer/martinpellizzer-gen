    "intro": "Pteryxia terebinthina var. californica, commonly known as the California boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of California. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and tightly arranged. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Its slow growth rate makes it ideal for formal hedging and topiary."
