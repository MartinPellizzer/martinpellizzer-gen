    "intro": "Pedicularis oederi, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its specialized roots. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture."
