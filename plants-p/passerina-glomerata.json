    "intro": "Passerina glomerata, commonly known as the clustered pasqueflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy, pinkish-purple flower clusters in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other early-season pollinators. Passerina glomerata is an important component of high-elevation ecosystems and is considered a symbol of resilience in harsh environments."
