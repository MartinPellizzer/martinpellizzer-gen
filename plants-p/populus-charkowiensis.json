    "intro": "Populus charkowiensis, commonly known as the Charkowian poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
