    "intro": "Podonephelium balansae, commonly known as the Balansae's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate inflorescence composed of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant is epiphytic, growing on trees and rocks rather than in soil, and relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its flowers are pollinated by specialized insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Podonephelium balansae is considered critically endangered."
