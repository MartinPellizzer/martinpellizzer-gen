    "intro": "Papaver steindorssonianum, commonly known as the Steindorff poppy, is a rare and striking species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, with a distinctive blackish center. The plant produces papery, saucer-shaped petals that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters in diameter. Its capsule fruit contains numerous small, dark seeds, and it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
