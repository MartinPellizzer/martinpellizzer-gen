    "intro": "Psychotria ankarensis, commonly known as the African angel's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, dark blue berries that contain the seeds. Psychotria ankarensis is also notable for containing psychoactive alkaloids, which have been studied for their potential medicinal and hallucinogenic properties."
