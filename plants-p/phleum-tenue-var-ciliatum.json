    "intro": "Phleum tenue var. ciliatum, commonly known as the silky oat, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its delicate structure and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value."
