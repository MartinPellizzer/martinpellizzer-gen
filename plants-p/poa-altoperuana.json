    "intro": "Poa altoperuana, commonly known as the Peruvian meadow grass, is a species of grass native to the high Andes of Peru. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves that are adapted to the cold, high-altitude environment. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, with spikelets that are often covered in short hairs. Poa altoperuana plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
