    "intro": "Populus alba var. subintegerrima, commonly known as the white poplar with smooth bark, is a variant of the white poplar native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its white, often fuzzy undersides on the leaves and smooth, pale bark that lacks the fissures seen in other poplar varieties. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. It produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. This variety is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
