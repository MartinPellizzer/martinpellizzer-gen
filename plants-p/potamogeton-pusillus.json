It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, and it relies on water currents for pollination. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms. Potamogeton pusillus is often used in water quality assessments due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
