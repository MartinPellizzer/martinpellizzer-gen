    "intro": "Pteris japonica, commonly known as Japanese water fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble water lilies, typically growing in wet, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that can form dense mats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Pteris japonica is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various moist conditions."
