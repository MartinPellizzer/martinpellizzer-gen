    "intro": "Plagioscyphus cauliflorus, commonly known as the red-flowered rock orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia. The plant is characterized by its striking red or pink flowers that bloom in a caudex, a swollen base that stores water and nutrients. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, adapted to its rocky, sunny habitat. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
