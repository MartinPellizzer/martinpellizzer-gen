    "intro": "Polystichum stramineum, commonly known as the yellow cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow-green fronds, which are lanceolate in shape and often have a waxy texture. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
