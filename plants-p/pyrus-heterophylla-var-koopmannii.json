    "intro": "Pyrus heterophylla var. koopmannii, commonly known as the Koopmann's pear, is a variant of the heterophylla pear, native to southern Africa. It is a small deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its alternate, often lobed leaves that vary in shape depending on light exposure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in Mediterranean climates. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often grown in botanical gardens and private collections."
