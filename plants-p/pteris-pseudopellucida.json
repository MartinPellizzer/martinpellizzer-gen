    "intro": "Pteris pseudopellucida, commonly known as the translucent water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear translucent or semi-transparent, especially when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a decorative plant in humid environments."
