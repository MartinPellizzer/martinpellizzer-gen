    "intro": "Potentilla alpestris var. planorum, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has wiry, upright stems covered with fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are pinnately divided into five to seven leaflets. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open meadows and mountainous areas. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other Potentilla species, adapting to harsh, high-altitude environments."
