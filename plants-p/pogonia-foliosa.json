    "intro": "Pogonia foliosa, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires a specific mycorrhizal relationship for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Pogonia foliosa is listed as endangered in several states due to habitat loss and overcollection."
