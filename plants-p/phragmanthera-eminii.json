    "intro": "Phragmanthera eminii, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and Turkey. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and a fibrous root system. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
