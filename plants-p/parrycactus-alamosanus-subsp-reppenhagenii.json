    "intro": "Parrycactus alamosanus subsp. reppenhagenii, commonly known as the Reppenhagen's parrycactus, is a rare cactus species native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils with full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
