    "intro": "Pimpinella integerrima, commonly known as the European cow-wheat, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, hairy fruit that aids in wind dispersal. Pimpinella integerrima is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows."
