    "intro": "Phaca flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible phaca, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, arching stems that often form a dense mat or rosette. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers in the summer. Phaca flexuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
