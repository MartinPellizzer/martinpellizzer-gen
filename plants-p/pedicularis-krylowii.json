    "intro": "Pedicularis krylowii, commonly known as the Krylov's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling the shape of a louse, hence its common name. It thrives in alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
