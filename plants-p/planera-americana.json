    "intro": "Planera americana, commonly known as the American sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark that peels in patches, revealing a mottled gray and white appearance. The tree has opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a rough texture and serrated edges. Its flowers are small, inconspicuous, and appear in clusters, while its fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule. The plant is often found along riverbanks and in moist woodlands, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
