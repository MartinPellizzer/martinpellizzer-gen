    "intro": "Panicum lanuginosum var. praecocius, commonly known as early millet, is a grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to golden florets. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
