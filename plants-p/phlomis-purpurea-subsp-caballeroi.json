It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, purple to pink flower clusters that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and wildflower meadows. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
