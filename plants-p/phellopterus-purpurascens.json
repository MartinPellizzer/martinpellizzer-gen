    "intro": "Phellopterus purpurascens, commonly known as the purpleleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with a reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. Phellopterus purpurascens plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying Arctic flora."
