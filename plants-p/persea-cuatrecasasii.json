    "intro": "Persea cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas\u2019s persimmon, is a rare and endemic species native to Mexico. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in panicles. Its fruit is a smooth, orange-red berry that ripens in the autumn season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
