    "intro": "Pterophylla comorensis, commonly known as the Comoros pterophylla, is a flowering plant native to the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
