    "intro": "Paronychia chionaea subsp. chionaea, commonly known as snowflakes or white snow grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia and North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with clustered stems and small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and the plant is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
