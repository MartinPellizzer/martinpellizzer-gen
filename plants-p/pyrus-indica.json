    "intro": "Pyrus indica, commonly known as the Indian pear, is a species of apple tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its deciduous nature, producing small, yellowish-green fruits that are typically harvested in the autumn. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with serrated margins. Its flowers are white and appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. The fruit, while less commonly consumed than other apple varieties, is used in traditional medicine and culinary practices in its native region."
