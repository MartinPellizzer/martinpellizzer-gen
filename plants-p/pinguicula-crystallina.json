    "intro": "Pinguicula crystallina, commonly known as the crystalline butterwort, is a small carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they bloom during the cooler months. Pinguicula crystallina is valued for its unique appearance and its role in ecological systems where it helps control insect populations."
