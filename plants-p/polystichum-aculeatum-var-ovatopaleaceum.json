    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. ovatopaleaceum, commonly known as the ovate paleaceum sword fern, is a variant of the holly fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its robust, dark green fronds that are ovate in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fertile fronds, which are often curled and clustered. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticulture for its hardy and adaptable nature."
