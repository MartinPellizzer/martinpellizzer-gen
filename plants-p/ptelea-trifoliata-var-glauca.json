    "intro": "Ptelea trifoliata var. glauca, commonly known as the blue-leaf boxwood, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive blue-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and are typically oval in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds. It is often used in horticulture as a decorative plant due to its attractive appearance and hardiness."
