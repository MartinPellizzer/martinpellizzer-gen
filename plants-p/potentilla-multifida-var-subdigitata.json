    "intro": "Potentilla multifida var. subdigitata, commonly known as the subdigitate potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, subdigitate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
