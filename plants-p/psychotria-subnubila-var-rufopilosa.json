It is native to the high-altitude cloud forests of northern South America, particularly in regions of Ecuador and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a reddish underside, giving it its common name. It produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. This variant is closely related to other Psychotria species, some of which contain psychoactive compounds."
