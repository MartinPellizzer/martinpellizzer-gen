    "intro": "Phleum boehmeri var. ciliatum, commonly known as the silky brome, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silky hair on the leaf blades and stems, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. This variety is often used in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and adaptability."
