It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its unique foliage and compact growth habit make it a desirable ornamental plant in horticulture."
