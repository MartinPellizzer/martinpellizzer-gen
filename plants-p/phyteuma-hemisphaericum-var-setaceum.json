    "intro": "Phyteuma hemisphaericum var. setaceum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved phyteuma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
