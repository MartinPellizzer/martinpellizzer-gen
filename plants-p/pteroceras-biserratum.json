    "intro": "Pteroceras biserratum, commonly known as the serrated horned scale, is a species of plant belonging to the family Lecanoraceae. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus that is often covered with small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in temperate regions, thriving in humid and shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, called soredia, are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across different substrates. The lichen's ability to tolerate environmental stress makes it a common indicator species in ecological studies."
