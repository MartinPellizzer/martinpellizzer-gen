    "intro": "Phyllocactus oxypetalus, commonly known as the velvet cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety spines that provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming during the warmer months. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in low-nutrient, dry environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
