    "intro": "Palicourea cuspidulata, commonly known as the Brazilian star apple or *Cupua\u00e7u*, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often pubescent leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, fleshy berries. Its fruit, which resembles a star shape, contains a sweet, creamy pulp with a unique flavor. Palicourea cuspidulata is valued not only for its fruit but also for its potential medicinal properties."
