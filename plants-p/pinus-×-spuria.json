    "intro": "Pinus \u00d7 spuria, commonly known as the hybrid fir or white fir, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Pinus albicaulis and Pinus muricata. It is characterized by its conical shape and long, soft needles that are typically lighter in color compared to other fir species. The tree produces cones that are often reddish-brown and can remain on the tree for several years before opening. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is commonly found in mountainous regions of the western United States. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
