It is characterized by its showy, butterfly-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant is known for its cauliflorous growth habit, where flowers and sometimes fruits develop directly from the trunk or branches. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its foliage is broad and often has a slightly hairy texture, adding to its visual appeal."
