    "intro": "Parodia scopa subsp. succinea, commonly known as the \"Cactus Mouse,\" is a compact, globular cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It features a short, thick stem with a dense covering of white, woolly bristles that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its succulent leaves are modified into spines, which provide protection from herbivores and aid in reducing transpiration. This subspecies is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
