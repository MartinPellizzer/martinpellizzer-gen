    "intro": "Primula fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features a low-growing rosette of oval, dark green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
