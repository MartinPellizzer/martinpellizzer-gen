    "intro": "Panax cephalobotrys, commonly known as the helmet ginseng, is a rare and unique species of the ginseng family (Araliaceae). It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped root system. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has compound leaves with a feathery appearance. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in umbels, and it produces red berries that contain the seeds. Due to its rarity and medicinal potential, it is considered a valuable but endangered plant in its native habitat."
