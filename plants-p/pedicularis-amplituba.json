    "intro": "Pedicularis amplituba, commonly known as the broad-tubed lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive two-lipped structure. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats at high altitudes. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
