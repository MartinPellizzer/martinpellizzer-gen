    "intro": "Pappostipa chrysophylla f. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf golden feather grass, is a compact, low-growing grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright yellow to golden in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
