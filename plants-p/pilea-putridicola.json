    "intro": "Pilea putridicola, commonly known as the stinking begonia, is a unique member of the Begoniaceae family. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its most notable feature is its strong, unpleasant odor, which is believed to attract certain pollinators. Native to tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
