    "intro": "Pavetta cinerea, commonly known as silver pavetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring smooth, greyish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Pavetta cinerea is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
