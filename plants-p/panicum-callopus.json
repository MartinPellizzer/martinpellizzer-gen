    "intro": "Panicum callopus, commonly known as flame grass, is a striking ornamental grass native to the southeastern United States. It features tall, upright clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that turn brilliant red and orange in the fall. The plant produces delicate, feathery panicles that add movement and texture to the landscape. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Panicum callopus is drought-tolerant and low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for gardens and naturalized areas."
