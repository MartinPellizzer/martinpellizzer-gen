    "intro": "Pomatium canescens, commonly known as the white river mussel, is a freshwater bivalve mollusk native to the United States. It belongs to the family Unionidae and is characterized by its elongated, oval shell that is typically pale in color with a rough, pearly surface. The species is often found in slow-moving rivers and streams with sandy or gravelly substrates. Its shell has a distinct hinge and a series of radial ribs that are more pronounced on the posterior half. Pomatium canescens plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by filtering water and serving as a food source for various predators."
