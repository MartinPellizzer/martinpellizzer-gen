It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. Its inflorescence consists of a single, showy flower that emerges from the center of the rosette. Polystachya songaniensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
