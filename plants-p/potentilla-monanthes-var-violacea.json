It is characterized by its delicate, violet-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves composed of five oval-shaped leaflets, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers cool and moist conditions."
