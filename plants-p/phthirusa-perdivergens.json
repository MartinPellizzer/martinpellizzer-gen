    "intro": "Phthirusa perdivergens, commonly known as the wandering spider, is a species of orb-weaving spider found in various regions of Africa and South America. It is characterized by its slender body and long, spindly legs, which aid in its agile movement through its habitat. The spider's web is typically a classic orb-shaped structure, constructed using silk produced from its spinnerets. Phthirusa perdivergens is known for its ability to disperse widely, often wandering from one web to another in search of prey. Its ecological role includes contributing to the control of insect populations in its native environments."
