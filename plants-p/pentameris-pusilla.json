    "intro": "Pentameris pusilla, commonly known as the small pentameris, is a small herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its small size and delicate appearance, it is often overlooked but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
