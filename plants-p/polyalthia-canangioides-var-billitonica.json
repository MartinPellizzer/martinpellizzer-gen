    "intro": "Polyalthia canangioides var. billitonica, commonly known as the Borneo ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, heavy wood and dense foliage, making it a valuable species in both ecological and commercial contexts. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptic to ovate in shape, with a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. This variant is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching heights of over 30 meters in its natural habitat."
