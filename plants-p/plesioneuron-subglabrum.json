    "intro": "Plesioneuron subglabrum, commonly known as the smooth plesioneuron, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, characterized by a flat, ribbon-like body that is covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on the upper surface of the thallus and produce spores for dispersal. Plesioneuron subglabrum is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for undisturbed, humid habitats."
