    "intro": "Picea \u00d7 fennica subsp. uralensis, commonly known as the Siberian fir, is a hybrid conifer native to the boreal regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like foliage. The tree produces cone-shaped seed cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cold climates and is adapted to poor, well-drained soils. This subspecies is often used in reforestation projects due to its resilience and ecological importance."
