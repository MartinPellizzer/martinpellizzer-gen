    "intro": "Pteris hovenkampii, commonly known as the Hovenkamp's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds. Pteris hovenkampii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor or outdoor plant."
