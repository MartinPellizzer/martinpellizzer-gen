    "intro": "Polygala orthiocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant features small, delicate flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. Polygala orthiocarpa is often found in coastal and limestone areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
