    "intro": "Pothos dolichophyllus, commonly known as the long-leaf pothos, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender, and waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability. Its rapid growth rate makes it an excellent choice for hanging baskets or as a trailing plant. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a slightly notched margin, adding to its ornamental appeal."
