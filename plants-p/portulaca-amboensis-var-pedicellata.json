    "intro": "Portulaca amboensis var. pedicellata, commonly known as the clustered portulaca, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, succulent stems that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, vibrant flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in the morning and closing by midday. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its drought tolerance and attractive floral display."
