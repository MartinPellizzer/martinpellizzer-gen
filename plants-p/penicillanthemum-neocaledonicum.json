    "intro": "Penicillanthemum neocaledonicum, commonly known as the New Caledonian penicillanthemum, is a flowering plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive bracts and often edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution in the South Pacific."
