    "intro": "Peucedanum morrisonicola, commonly known as Morrison's angelica, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in small, dry fruits and are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
