    "intro": "Poa trivialis var. stricta, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its more upright growth habit compared to the typical form of Poa trivialis."
