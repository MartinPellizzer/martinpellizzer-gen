It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a houseplant. Its slow growth and low maintenance make it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
