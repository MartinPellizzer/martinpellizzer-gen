    "intro": "Ptychotis saxifraga subsp. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features basal leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic, with a hairy surface, and stem leaves that are more linear. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and arranged in a dense cluster at the top of the stem. This subspecies is notable for its morphological variability, which is reflected in its common name."
