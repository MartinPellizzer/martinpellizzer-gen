It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves with fine, serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, orange-red fruits that are sweet and tart. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. Prunus denticulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal beauty."
