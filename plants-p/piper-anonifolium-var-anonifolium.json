    "intro": "Piper anonifolium var. anonifolium, commonly known as the black pepper plant, is a member of the Piperaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that develop into the familiar black, white, and red peppercorns. The plant is a climbing vine that requires support, such as a trellis or pole, to grow properly. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic and medicinal properties. The fruit, which is the peppercorn, is the primary part harvested for culinary and pharmaceutical uses."
