    "intro": "Phyllodoce deflexa, commonly known as the bent-leaved mountain-mint, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often curled or folded, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, wooded habitats and is often found in streamside areas. Phyllodoce deflexa is valued for its aromatic foliage and its role in supporting local pollinators."
