    "intro": "Parapholis \u00d7 pauneroae, commonly known as the hybrid grass, is a sterile, herbaceous plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Parapholis virgata and Parapholis pauneroa, characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and marshes. It lacks the ability to produce viable seeds, relying instead on vegetative propagation for survival. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an example of hybridization in grasses and its ecological adaptations to wetland environments."
