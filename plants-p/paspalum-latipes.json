    "intro": "Paspalum latipes, commonly known as the slender paspalum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed habitats and can be an indicator species for wetland ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
