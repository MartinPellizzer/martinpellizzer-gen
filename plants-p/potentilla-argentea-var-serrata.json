    "intro": "Potentilla argentea var. serrata, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It features a low-growing habit with silver-white, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its frost-resistant nature and ability to bloom reliably in cooler climates."
