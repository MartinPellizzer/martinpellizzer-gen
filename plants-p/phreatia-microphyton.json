    "intro": "Phreatia microphyton, commonly known as the minute phreatia orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees in tropical rainforests. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, delicate leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance, and appear in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
