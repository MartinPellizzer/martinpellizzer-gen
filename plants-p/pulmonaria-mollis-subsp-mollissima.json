    "intro": "Pulmonaria mollis subsp. mollissima, commonly known as the soft lungwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to central and eastern Europe. It features distinctive, velvety, dark green foliage with silver-white markings that resemble lung tissue, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-purple flowers in early spring, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in moist, shady woodland areas and is often used in garden settings for its ornamental value. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and remain attractive throughout the growing season."
