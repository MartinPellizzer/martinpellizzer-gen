    "intro": "Poa alberti subsp. kunlunensis, commonly known as the Kunlun grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with small, two-ranked spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique ecological niche and potential for use in restoration projects in alpine regions."
