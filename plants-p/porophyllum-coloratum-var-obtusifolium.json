    "intro": "Porophyllum coloratum var. obtusifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small blue to purple flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and is adapted to arid environments. Its botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for pollinators and as a component of native plant communities."
