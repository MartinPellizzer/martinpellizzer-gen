    "intro": "Phoradendron dwyeri, commonly known as the Dwyer's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Viscaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and white, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. Its life cycle involves birds dispersing its seeds, which then germinate on the bark of suitable host trees. This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects despite its toxic properties."
