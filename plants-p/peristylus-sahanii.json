    "intro": "Peristylus sahanii, commonly known as the Sahanii starflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
