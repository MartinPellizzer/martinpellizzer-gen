    "intro": "Polygonum anomalum, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features distinctive, zigzagging stems that help it climb or trail along the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Polygonum anomalum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
