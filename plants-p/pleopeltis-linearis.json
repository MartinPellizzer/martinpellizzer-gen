    "intro": "Pleopeltis linearis, commonly known as the linear fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, linear fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The leaves are typically dark green and have a delicate, feathery appearance, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
