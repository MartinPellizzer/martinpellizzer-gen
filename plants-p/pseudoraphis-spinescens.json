    "intro": "Pseudoraphis spinescens, commonly known as the spiny cypress, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which are often mistaken for leaves. Its woody stems are covered in thick, leathery bark that provides protection against drought and herbivory. Pseudoraphis spinescens is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
