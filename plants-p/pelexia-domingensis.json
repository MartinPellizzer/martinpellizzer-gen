    "intro": "Pelexia domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican pelexia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Pelexia domingensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited geographic distribution."
