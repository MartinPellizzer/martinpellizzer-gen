    "intro": "Plagiolirion horsmannii, commonly known as the Horsmann's lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the island of Socotra. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, nodding flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has strap-like leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid native habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing in crevices among the limestone formations of Socotra. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
