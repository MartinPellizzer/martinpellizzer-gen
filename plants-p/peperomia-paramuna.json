    "intro": "Peperomia paramuna, commonly known as the velvet peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy, and velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia paramuna is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
