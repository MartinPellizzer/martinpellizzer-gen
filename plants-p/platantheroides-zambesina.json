It features a dense, dark green, strap-like foliage and produces intricate, fragrant flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The flowers are typically white or pale purple, arranged in a loose spiral pattern along the stem. This species thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. It is characterized by its mycorrhizal association, which is essential for its nutrient uptake and survival."
