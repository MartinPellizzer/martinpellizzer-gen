    "intro": "Pritchardia maideniana, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 cycad, is a rare cycad species native to Hawaii. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones rather than flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the unique climate of the Hawaiian Islands. Due to habitat loss and limited natural reproduction, it is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
