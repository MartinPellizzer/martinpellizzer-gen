    "intro": "Pteris incurvata, commonly known as the curled maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that curl inward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Pteris incurvata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
