    "intro": "Plantago tomentosa var. lasiophylla, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a variant of the common plantain species. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its dense, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white or gray pubescence. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a rough texture that aids in water retention. It produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its medicinal properties."
