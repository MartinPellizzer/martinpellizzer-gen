    "intro": "Potentilla verna f. pilosior, commonly known as the hairy willow-herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered with fine pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The flowers appear in early spring, and the plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
