    "intro": "Pogonia uniflora, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, showy pink and white flower with a single, pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species in many areas."
