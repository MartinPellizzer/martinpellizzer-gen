    "intro": "Potentilla heptaphylla var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and the plant produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
