It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feather-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish spikelets that are clustered along the stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in coastal and upland areas. Panicum lanaiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional Hawaiian landscaping."
