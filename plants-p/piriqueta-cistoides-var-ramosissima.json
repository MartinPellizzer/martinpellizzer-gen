    "intro": "Piriqueta cistoides var. ramosissima, commonly known as the ramose piriqueta, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. This variety is notable for its branching structure, which gives it a distinctive, bushy appearance."
