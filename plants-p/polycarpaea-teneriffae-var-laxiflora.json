    "intro": "Polycarpaea teneriffae var. laxiflora, commonly known as the Teneriffe thornapple, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive thorn-like projections. The plant typically grows in rocky coastal areas and is adapted to the arid and saline conditions of its native habitat. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
