    "intro": "Poa retroflexa, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in disturbed soils. Poa retroflexa is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas."
