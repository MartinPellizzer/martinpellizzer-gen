    "intro": "Puneeria, commonly known as Indian vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is native to South Asia and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Puneeria is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes cultivated for its nitrogen-fixing properties."
