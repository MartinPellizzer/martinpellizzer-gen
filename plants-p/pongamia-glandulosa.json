    "intro": "Pongamia glandulosa, commonly known as the Indian beech, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers followed by pods containing oily seeds that are used in various traditional applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and riverine regions. Pongamia glandulosa is also valued for its potential in biofuel production due to the high oil content in its seeds."
