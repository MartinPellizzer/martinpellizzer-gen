    "intro": "Ptilagrostis purpurea, commonly known as the purple hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear purple to pinkish flowers, which bloom in late summer. Ptilagrostis purpurea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, particularly in regions with a cool climate."
