    "intro": "Parkia filicoidea, commonly known as the featherleaf acacia, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are finely divided and resemble feathers, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes cultivated for ecological and agricultural purposes."
