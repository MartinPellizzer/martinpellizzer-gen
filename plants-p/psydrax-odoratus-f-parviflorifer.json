    "intro": "Psydrax odoratus f. parviflorifer, commonly known as the small-flowered scentless psidium, is a rare and unique variant of the psidium genus. It is characterized by its reduced floral size and a distinct lack of the typical aromatic qualities found in other members of the species. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green or white in color. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This botanical variant is of interest to horticulturists and botanists due to its unique morphological traits and potential for genetic study."
