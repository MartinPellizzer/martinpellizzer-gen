    "intro": "Poa nevadensis var. leckenbyi, commonly known as the Lehman's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing sods that are well adapted to cold, alpine environments. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and open slopes at elevations above 7,000 feet. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to silver flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
