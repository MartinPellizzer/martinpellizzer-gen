It is characterized by its showy, blue or purple flower clusters that resemble mist, hence its common name. The plants are native to various regions in the Americas and are often found in moist, woodland habitats. Physostemon species typically have opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, fragrant flowers. They are valued in gardens for their ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
