    "intro": "Platanthera \u00d7 hybrida var. graebneri, commonly known as the Graebner's coralroot, is a hybrid orchid species native to central and eastern North America. It is a terrestrial herb that lacks chlorophyll and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in a spike, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. Due to its reliance on specific fungal partners, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
