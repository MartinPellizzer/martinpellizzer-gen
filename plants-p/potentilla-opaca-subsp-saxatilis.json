    "intro": "Potentilla opaca subsp. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
