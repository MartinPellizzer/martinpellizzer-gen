    "intro": "Pritchardia beccariana var. giffardiana, commonly known as the Giffard's breadfruit, is a rare and endemic palm species native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by edible, breadfruit-like drupes. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
