It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. This subspecies is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. Its foliage is typically a dark green, and it produces delicate, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant is often mistaken for other similar grasses due to its subtle appearance and growth habit."
