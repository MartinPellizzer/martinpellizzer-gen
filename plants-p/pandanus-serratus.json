    "intro": "Pandanus serratus, commonly known as the saw-tooth pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that eventually develop into fibrous, pineapple-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional weaving and construction. The species is adapted to coastal and wetland environments, making it an important component of island ecosystems."
