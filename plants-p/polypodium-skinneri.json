    "intro": "Polypodium skinneri, commonly known as the Skinner's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
