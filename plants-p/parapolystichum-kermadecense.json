    "intro": "Parapolystichum kermadecense, commonly known as the Kermadec sword fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the Kermadec Islands in the South Pacific. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped, evergreen fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in coastal forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
