    "intro": "Parinari pumila, commonly known as the small parinari, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Nigeria and Ghana. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by various wildlife species. Parinari pumila is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in local crafts and construction."
