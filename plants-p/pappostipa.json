    "intro": "Pappostipa, commonly known as the woolly grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are characterized by their dense, tufted growth habit and often bear a fluffy appearance due to the presence of silky hairs on their leaves and stems. Pappostipa species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where they thrive in well-drained soils. They produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in landscaping for their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
