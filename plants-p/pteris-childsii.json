    "intro": "Pteris childsii, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a lacy pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in damp forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. Pteris childsii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
