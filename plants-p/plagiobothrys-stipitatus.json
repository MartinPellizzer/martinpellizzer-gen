    "intro": "Plagiobothrys stipitatus, commonly known as the slender bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, showy pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, inflated pods that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
