    "intro": "Pinus nigricans, commonly known as the black pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark, bark-like trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Its root system is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The species is valued for its timber and is also an important component of local ecosystems."
