    "intro": "Psephellus zuvandicus subsp. gegharkunikensis, commonly known as the Gegharkunik psephellus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous areas with rich, humus-filled soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
