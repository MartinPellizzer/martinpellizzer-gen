    "intro": "Phleum himalaicum, commonly known as Himalayan oat, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Phleum himalaicum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
