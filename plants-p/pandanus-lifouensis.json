    "intro": "Pandanus lifouensis, commonly known as the Lifou pandanus, is a striking tropical plant native to the island of Lifou in the French Territory of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, often with a waxy texture and a reddish or brownish hue. The plant produces fragrant, spadix-like inflorescences that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in coastal or swampy environments. The Lifou pandanus plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various local species."
