    "intro": "Polygonum lapathifolium var. nodosum, commonly known as the nodding knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Asia. It features upright stems that are often reddish in color and bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a persistent weed and a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
