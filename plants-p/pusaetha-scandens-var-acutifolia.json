    "intro": "Pusaetha scandens var. acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved climbing fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its climbing habit and feathery fronds. It features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are distinctly pointed, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures on the undersides of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rapid growth and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for living walls and green spaces."
