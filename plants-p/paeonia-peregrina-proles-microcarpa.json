    "intro": "Paeonia peregrina proles microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf tree peony, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, double flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant produces small, dark brown seeds encased in follicles, which are dispersed by wind. It prefers well-drained, alkaline soils and thrives in full sun, making it a challenging but rewarding addition to botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
