    "intro": "Pyrus flinckii, commonly known as the Flinck's pear, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5 to 10 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a serrated margin and a glossy dark green upper surface. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, edible pomes that ripen in the fall. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, Pyrus flinckii is considered a rare and endangered species."
