    "intro": "Polygonum lapathifolium subsp. neglectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved smartweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist soils along streambanks, wet meadows, and disturbed sites. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red. Its seed capsules are three-angled and dehiscent, releasing tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
