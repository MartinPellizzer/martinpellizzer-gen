    "intro": "Paeonia humilis var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf peony or miniature peony, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant, double or semi-double flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant produces palmately compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its roots are thick and fleshy, typical of the Paeoniaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its showy blooms and hardy nature."
