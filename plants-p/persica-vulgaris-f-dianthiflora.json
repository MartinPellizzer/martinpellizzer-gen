    "intro": "Persica vulgaris f. dianthiflora, commonly known as the pink-flowered peach, is a horticultural form of the peach tree characterized by its distinctive pink or reddish-pink flowers. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal rather than its fruiting qualities. The plant typically features a compact growth habit with dense foliage and showy blooms that appear in early spring. Its flowers are often more showy than those of the common peach, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. The botanical features of this form include its floral structure, which closely resembles that of the wild species, with five petals and numerous stamens."
