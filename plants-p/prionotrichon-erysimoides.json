It is a low-growing perennial that produces yellow flowers resembling those of the common dandelion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. Prionotrichon erysimoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
