    "intro": "Phinaea repens, commonly known as the creeping phinaea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture and are arranged alternately along the stems. Phinaea repens is often used in ground cover landscaping due to its ability to suppress weeds and its ornamental appeal."
