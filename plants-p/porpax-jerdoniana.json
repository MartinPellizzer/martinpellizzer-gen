    "intro": "Porpax jerdoniana, commonly known as the Jerdon's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower with a distinctive greenish-yellow hue. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. It is classified as an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in the ground. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Porpax jerdoniana is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
