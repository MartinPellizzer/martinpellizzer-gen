    "intro": "Picea mariana var. fastigiata, commonly known as the stiff spruce, is a compact, columnar evergreen conifer native to northern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit and dense foliage, which gives it a formal appearance. The leaves are typically dark green, needle-like, and arranged in tight spirals along the stems. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental shape and adaptability to various soil conditions. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
