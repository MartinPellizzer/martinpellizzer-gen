    "intro": "Portulaca peteri, commonly known as the rock morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically opening in the morning and closing by midday. Its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought makes it well adapted to harsh environments. Portulaca peteri is often found growing on rocky slopes and in sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
