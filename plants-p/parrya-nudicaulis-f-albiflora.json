    "intro": "Parrya nudicaulis f. albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflower parrya, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces delicate white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
