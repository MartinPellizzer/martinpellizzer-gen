    "intro": "Pauridia curculigoides, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Atlantic. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in salt marshes or along the shoreline. It has a short flowering period, typically in late spring or early summer. Due to its hardy nature and ability to tolerate saline conditions, it is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
