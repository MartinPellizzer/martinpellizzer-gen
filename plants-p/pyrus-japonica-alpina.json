    "intro": "Pyrus japonica alpina, commonly known as the alpine Japanese pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are similar to pears. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
