    "intro": "Pitcairnia tuberculata, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a central cup that collects rainwater. Pitcairnia tuberculata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
