    "intro": "Phelipanche schweinfurthii, commonly known as the Mediterranean broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of flowering plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, fleshy stem. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in dry, disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings."
