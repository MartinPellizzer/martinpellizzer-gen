    "intro": "Peucedanum carvifolium, commonly known as Caraway-leaved Angelica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and grows in alpine environments. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that are followed by small, dry fruits containing aromatic seeds. Its leaves and roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's scent is reminiscent of both caraway and anise, contributing to its use in herbal remedies and culinary applications."
