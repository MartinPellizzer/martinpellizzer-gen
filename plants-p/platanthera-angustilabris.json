    "intro": "Platanthera angustilabris, commonly known as the narrow-lipped twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous plant with a slender, upright stem and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant lacks true leaves, relying instead on its underground rhizomes for nutrient storage. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Platanthera angustilabris is pollinated by specific insects, including flies and beetles, due to its lack of showy petals."
