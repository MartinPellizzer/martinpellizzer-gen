    "intro": "Polypodium pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered water fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are pinnately compound and often covered in a thin, waxy layer. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium pauciflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
