    "intro": "Pseudocoptosperma menabense, commonly known as the Menabens cypress, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, feathery foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, cone-like structures containing its seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
