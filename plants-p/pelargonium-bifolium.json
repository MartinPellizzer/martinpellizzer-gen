    "intro": "Pelargonium bifolium, commonly known as the two-leaf geranium, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a compact growth habit with hairy, upright stems and small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in pairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract beneficial insects like ladybugs and lacewings."
