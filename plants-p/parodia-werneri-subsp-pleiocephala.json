    "intro": "Parodia werneri subsp. pleiocephala, commonly known as the \"Cushion Cactus,\" is a compact, globular cactus native to southern Africa. It features a dense, rounded stem covered in short, white spines, giving it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in summer. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens and containers."
