It features slender, upright branches and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to temperate climates. The species is also valued for its role in hedgerows and as a wildlife habitat."
