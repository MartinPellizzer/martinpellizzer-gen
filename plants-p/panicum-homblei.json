    "intro": "Panicum homblei, commonly known as the Hombli grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
