    "intro": "Pedicularis resupinata subsp. oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved lousewort, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of leaves and its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with moist, well-drained conditions."
