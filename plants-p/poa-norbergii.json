    "intro": "Poa norbergii, commonly known as the Norberg's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that gives it its common name. Poa norbergii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, attractive turf."
