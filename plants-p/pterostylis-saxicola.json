    "intro": "Pterostylis saxicola, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower spike that bears a single, greenish-white flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized pollination mechanism involving small flies. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
