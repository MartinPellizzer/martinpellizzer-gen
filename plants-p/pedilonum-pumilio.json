    "intro": "Pedilonum pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, white, nocturnal blooms that open at night and close by dawn. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators such as moths. Pedilonum pumilio is often cultivated for its unique beauty and adaptability to dry conditions."
