    "intro": "Plantago boissieri var. tenera, commonly known as the woolly plantain, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on the leaves and stems, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Its adaptability makes it a resilient species in Mediterranean climates."
