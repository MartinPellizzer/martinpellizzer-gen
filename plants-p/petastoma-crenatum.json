It features alternate, ovate leaves with wavy margins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
