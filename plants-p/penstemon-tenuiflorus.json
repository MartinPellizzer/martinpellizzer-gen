It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance.
