It features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily in moist, shaded environments. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking foliage and adaptability to humid climates."
