    "intro": "Peucedanum ubadakense, commonly known as the Ubadak mountain angelica, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like inflorescences, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
