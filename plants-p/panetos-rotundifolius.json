    "intro": "Panetos rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leaf panetos, is a rare and lesser-known plant species characterized by its distinctive round, broad leaves. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs such as carrots and parsley. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators like bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
