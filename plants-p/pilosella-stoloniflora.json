    "intro": "Pilosella stoloniflora, commonly known as the creeping pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its stems are often creeping and produce numerous stolons, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant its characteristic appearance."
