    "intro": "Pycreus fontinalis, commonly known as the spring moss, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It typically grows on rocks, logs, or the edges of streams and ponds. The plant has a delicate, filamentous structure with dense, compact growth patterns. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and low light conditions. Pycreus fontinalis plays a vital role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing microhabitats for small invertebrates."
