    "intro": "Pouteria papyracea, commonly known as the paperbark spondias, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, papery bark that peels off in thin layers, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, orange-red fruits resembling small apples. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a slightly serrated margin. Pouteria papyracea is often found in humid lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental bark and edible fruits."
