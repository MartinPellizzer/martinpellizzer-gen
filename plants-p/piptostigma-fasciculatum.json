    "intro": "Piptostigma fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered leaf spurge, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with milky sap. It is often found in rocky soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system. The plant's structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry environments."
