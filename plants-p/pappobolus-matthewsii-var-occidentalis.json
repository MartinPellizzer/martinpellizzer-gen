It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats."
