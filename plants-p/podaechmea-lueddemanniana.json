    "intro": "Podaechmea lueddemanniana, commonly known as the Lueddemanniana cycad, is a species of cycad native to the island of Borneo. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
