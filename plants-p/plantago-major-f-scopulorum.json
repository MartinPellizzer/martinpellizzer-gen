    "intro": "Plantago major f. scopulorum, commonly known as the rock plantain, is a variant of the common plantain that thrives in rocky and gravelly soils. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spikes, which are typically borne on short, leafy stalks. It is a hardy perennial that is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and rocky outcrops. This subspecies is well adapted to arid and nutrient-poor environments, making it a common sight in dry, exposed areas."
