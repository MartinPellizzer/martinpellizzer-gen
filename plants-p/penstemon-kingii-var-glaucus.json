It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a powdery blue-gray coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.
