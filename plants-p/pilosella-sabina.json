    "intro": "Pilosella sabina, commonly known as the sandwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are surrounded by bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. Pilosella sabina is generally low-growing, with a mat-like structure that helps it survive in harsh environmental conditions."
