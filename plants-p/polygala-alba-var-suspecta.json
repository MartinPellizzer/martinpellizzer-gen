    "intro": "Polygala alba var. suspecta, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China and the Russian Far East. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and often have a hairy texture. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its botanical uses remain largely under-researched."
