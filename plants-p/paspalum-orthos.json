    "intro": "Paspalum orthos, commonly known as narrowleaf buffalograss, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, slender blades and dense growth habit, making it well-suited for turfgrass applications. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny environments and has a deep root system that enhances its drought tolerance. Its foliage is often a light green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Paspalum orthos is valued for its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
