    "intro": "Poa alopecurus subsp. shuka, commonly known as the Shuka bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
