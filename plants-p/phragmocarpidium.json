    "intro": "Phragmocarpidium, commonly known as the \"bottle-shaped spore capsule,\" is a unique structure found in certain species of fungi. It is characterized by its elongated, flask-like shape, which is formed by the fusion of the sporangium and the stalk. The capsule is typically covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps protect the spores from desiccation. Inside, the spores are arranged in a single layer, often with a distinctive ornamentation. This structure plays a crucial role in the dispersal and survival of the fungal species in various ecological niches."
