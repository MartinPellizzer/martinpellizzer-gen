It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
