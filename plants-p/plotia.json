    "intro": "Plotia, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Plotia is drought-tolerant and has adapted to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy plant in harsh environments. Its seeds are encased in pods and can remain viable in the soil for several years."
