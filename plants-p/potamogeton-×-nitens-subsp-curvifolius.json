It is characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like leaves that often curl at the tips, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like clusters. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes and slow-moving rivers. Its morphology and growth habits make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
