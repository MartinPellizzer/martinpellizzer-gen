    "intro": "Pouteria navicularis, commonly known as the canoe tree, is a tropical species native to Central and South America. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by edible, round fruits resembling small footballs. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
