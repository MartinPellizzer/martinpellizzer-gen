    "intro": "Polygonum raii subsp. norvegicum, commonly known as Norwegian knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to northern regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features upright, slender stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
