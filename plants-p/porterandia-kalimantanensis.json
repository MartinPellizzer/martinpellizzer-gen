It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and leathery leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often along the forest floor or in understory layers. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires protection to ensure its survival."
