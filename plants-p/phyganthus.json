    "intro": "Phyganthus, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical and southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their dense, velvety foliage and showy, clustered flowers that come in a variety of colors. Phyganthus species typically grow as compact, upright shrubs or herbs, often with hairy stems and leaves. They thrive in warm, humid environments and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The flowers are usually borne on long, slender stalks and are pollinated primarily by insects."
