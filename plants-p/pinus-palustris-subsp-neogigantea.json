    "intro": "Pinus palustris subsp. neogigantea, commonly known as the longleaf pine, is a subspecies native to the southeastern United States. It is a tall, evergreen conifer with long, needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of two. The plant produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in wet, sandy soils. This subspecies is adapted to fire-prone ecosystems and plays a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity in its habitat."
