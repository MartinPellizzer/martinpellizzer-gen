    "intro": "Philibertia fendleri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters in height, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and the plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Philibertia fendleri is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
