It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces striking, cone-like inflorescences that range in color from white to pink and red. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Protea arborescens is adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often found in fynbos vegetation."
