    "intro": "Panax secundus, commonly known as the secondary ginseng, is a lesser-known relative of the Panax genus. It is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China and Korea. The plant features a stout, fleshy root that is often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring. Panax secundus is valued for its potential medicinal properties, though it is less commercially cultivated than Panax ginseng."
