    "intro": "Phyllota gracilis, commonly known as slender phyllota, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Phyllota gracilis is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and is used in some traditional herbal practices."
