    "intro": "Plantago major f. latissima, commonly known as the broad-leaf plantain, is a variant of the common plantain characterized by its wider, more robust leaves. This perennial herb belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are often hidden beneath the leaves. It is often found in disturbed soils and is commonly used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
