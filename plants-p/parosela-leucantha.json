    "intro": "Parosela leucantha, commonly known as the white parosela, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its striking white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or forested areas, and thrives in cool, moist climates. Its leaves are broad and oval-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parosela leucantha is considered a rare and specialized species."
