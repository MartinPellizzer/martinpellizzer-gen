The plant has slender, branching stems and small, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Prunus debilis is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various wildlife species."
