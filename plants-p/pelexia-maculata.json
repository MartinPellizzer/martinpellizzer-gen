    "intro": "Pelexia maculata, commonly known as the spotted bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically blue to violet in color, with a distinctive white or yellow spot near the base of each petal. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Pelexia maculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom reliably in cooler climates."
