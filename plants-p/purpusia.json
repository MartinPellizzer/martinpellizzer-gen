These plants are native to various regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and Mexico. They are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers that resemble small bells. The leaves are usually compound, consisting of several leaflets arranged oppositely. Purpusia species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their deep root systems and drought-resistant foliage."
