It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.
