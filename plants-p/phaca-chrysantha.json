    "intro": "Phaca chrysantha, commonly known as the golden cupflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branching. Phaca chrysantha plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies due to its nectar-rich flowers."
