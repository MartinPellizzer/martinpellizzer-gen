    "intro": "Peucedanum payapicum, commonly known as the Payapicum angelica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in umbrella-like structures. Its roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, which include anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
