It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and its striking, hairy labellum, which gives it its common name. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular subject among orchid enthusiasts and botanists."
