    "intro": "Polypodium mutatum, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into small, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are released from the sporangia found on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
