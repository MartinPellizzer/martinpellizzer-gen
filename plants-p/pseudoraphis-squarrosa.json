    "intro": "Pseudoraphis squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly phyllophora, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, woolly, silver-gray foliage that covers the entire plant, providing a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its leaves and stems, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. Pseudoraphis squarrosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking visual appeal and low maintenance requirements."
