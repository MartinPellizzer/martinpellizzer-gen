    "intro": "Pinus remorata, commonly known as the red fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright form and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curved. The tree produces small, purple to reddish cones that mature over several years. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, often exfoliating to reveal a lighter inner layer. Pinus remorata thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-elevation forests."
