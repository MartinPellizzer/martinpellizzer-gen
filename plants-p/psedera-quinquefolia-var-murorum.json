    "intro": "Psedera quinquefolia var. murorum, commonly known as the five-leafed buckthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in groups of three or five. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by black, toxic berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
