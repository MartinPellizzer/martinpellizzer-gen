    "intro": "Paraprenanthes sylvicola, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to moist soils makes it a valuable species for wetland restoration projects."
