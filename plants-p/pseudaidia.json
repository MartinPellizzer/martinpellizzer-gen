    "intro": "Pseudaidia, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to southern Africa. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped or oblanceolate, with hairy surfaces. They produce yellow flowers that are similar in appearance to those of true dandelions. Pseudaidia species are often found in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in arid to semi-arid conditions."
