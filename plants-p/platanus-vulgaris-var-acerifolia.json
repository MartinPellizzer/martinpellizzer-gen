    "intro": "Platanus vulgaris var. acerifolia, commonly known as the London plane tree, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that resemble those of maple trees, hence its common name. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that split open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick, fissured, and often exhibits a mottled appearance. This species is highly adaptable and thrives in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soils."
