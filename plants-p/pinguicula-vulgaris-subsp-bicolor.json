    "intro": "Pinguicula vulgaris subsp. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap small insects. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically green on the upper surface and reddish or purplish on the underside, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and wet meadows."
