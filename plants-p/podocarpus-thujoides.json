    "intro": "Podocarpus thujoides, commonly known as the Japanese yew or Japanese podocarp, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Due to its slow growth rate and attractive appearance, it is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic and structural value."
