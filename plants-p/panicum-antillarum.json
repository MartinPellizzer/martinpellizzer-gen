    "intro": "Panicum antillarum, commonly known as the Caribbean grass or red panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted foliage that turns a striking red or bronze color during the dry season. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains of seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for use in ornamental landscaping and erosion control. Its adaptability to tropical and subtropical climates contributes to its widespread presence in these regions."
