    "intro": "Plantago australis subsp. pseudomollior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize disturbed soils. The plant has lanceolate, dark green leaves with a smooth surface and a distinctive basal rosette structure. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. This subspecies is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
