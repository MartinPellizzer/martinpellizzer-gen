    "intro": "Poa friesiorum, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions. Poa friesiorum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
