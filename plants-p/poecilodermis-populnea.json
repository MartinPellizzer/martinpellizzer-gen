    "intro": "Poecilodermis populnea, commonly known as the poplar leaf beetle, is a species of beetle that feeds on the leaves of poplar trees. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a herbivore within forest ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycling through leaf decomposition. The beetle's larvae primarily feed on the undersides of poplar leaves, causing visible damage that can affect tree health. It is often found in regions where poplar trees are prevalent, such as North America and parts of Europe. The plant's chemical composition, particularly its sap and tannins, influences the beetle's feeding behavior and life cycle."
