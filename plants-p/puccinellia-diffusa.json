    "intro": "Puccinellia diffusa, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is highly tolerant of saline soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability. Puccinellia diffusa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
