    "intro": "Pleopeltis kingii, commonly known as the King's rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features lanceolate, dark green leaves that are often covered in a thick layer of trichomes, giving them a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
