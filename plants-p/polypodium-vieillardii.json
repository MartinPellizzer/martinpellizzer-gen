    "intro": "Polypodium vieillardii, commonly known as the Vieillard's huperzia, is a fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically elongated and have a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Polypodium vieillardii is notable for its slow growth and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
