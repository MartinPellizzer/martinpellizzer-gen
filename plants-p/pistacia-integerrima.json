    "intro": "Pistacia integerrima, commonly known as the desert pistache, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, nut-like fruits that are often used in traditional cuisine. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and has deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soil conditions. Pistacia integerrima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
