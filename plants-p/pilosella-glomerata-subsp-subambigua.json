    "intro": "Pilosella glomerata subsp. subambigua, commonly known as the clustered pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure and growth habit compared to the typical form of Pilosella glomerata. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and long-lasting flowers."
