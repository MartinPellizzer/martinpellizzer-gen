    "intro": "Potentilla verna var. tommasiniana, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has wiry, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its leaves are usually pinnately divided into five oval leaflets, giving it the common name \"cinquefoil.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas."
