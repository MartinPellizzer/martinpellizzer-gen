    "intro": "Plantago canescens subsp. richardsonii, commonly known as the Richardson's plantain, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in desert scrub, grasslands, and along roadsides. Its fibrous roots and adaptive morphology enable it to survive in harsh, dry environments."
