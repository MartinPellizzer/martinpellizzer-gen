It features glossy, dark green, ovate leaves that are often adorned with silver or white veins, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the warmer months. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and moderate humidity. Its unique leaf patterns and manageable size make it a popular choice for tabletop displays and shaded garden areas."
