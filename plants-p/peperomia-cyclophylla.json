It is a compact, evergreen perennial plant characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves that often curl at the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of pink or white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate moisture. Due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
