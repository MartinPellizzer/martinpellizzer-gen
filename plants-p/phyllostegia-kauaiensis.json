    "intro": "Phyllostegia kauaiensis, commonly known as the Kauai mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
