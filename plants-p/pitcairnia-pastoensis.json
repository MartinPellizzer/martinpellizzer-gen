    "intro": "Pitcairnia pastoensis, commonly known as the Pasto pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection against intense sunlight. Pitcairnia pastoensis is also noted for its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil."
