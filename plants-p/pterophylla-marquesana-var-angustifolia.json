    "intro": "Pterophylla marquesana var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pterophylla, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its unique, palm-like appearance and woody structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky or coastal slopes. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
