    "intro": "Persicaria hydropiper var. glandulosissima, commonly known as the sticky smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and stems that are covered in glandular hairs, giving them a sticky texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy surface. This species thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and stream banks, and is often found in disturbed soils."
