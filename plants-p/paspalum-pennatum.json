    "intro": "Paspalum pennatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf grass or Florida paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Paspalum pennatum thrives in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, and is often found in areas with moist, acidic soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
