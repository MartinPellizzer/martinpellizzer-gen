    "intro": "Polystichopsis leucochaete, commonly known as the white-haired fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. The plant's unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
