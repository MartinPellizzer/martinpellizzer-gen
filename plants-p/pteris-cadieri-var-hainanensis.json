    "intro": "Pteris cadieri var. hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Pteris. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. Native to the tropical regions of China, particularly Hainan Island, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant's ability to thrive in humid conditions makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and wetland restoration projects."
