    "intro": "Pulmonaria variabilis, commonly known as variable lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Boraginaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves that often display a striking combination of green, white, and purple markings. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, typically blooming in early spring. Native to Europe, it thrives in woodland and shaded garden environments. Its foliage and floral structure make it a valuable addition to moist, well-drained soils in partial to full shade."
