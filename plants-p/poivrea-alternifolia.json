    "intro": "Poivrea alternifolia, commonly known as the alternate-leaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters. Its berries are small, black, and edible, though they are not widely consumed by humans. Poivrea alternifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
