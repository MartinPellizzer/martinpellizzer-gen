    "intro": "Pseudocystopteris lanpingensis, commonly known as the Lanping water fern, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along streams or in rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant exhibits a unique reproductive strategy compared to other ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
