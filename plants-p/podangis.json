    "intro": "Podangis, commonly known as the golden bell vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces pendulous, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in partial shade to full sun. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. The flowers are also used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
