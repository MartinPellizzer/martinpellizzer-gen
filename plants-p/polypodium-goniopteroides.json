    "intro": "Polypodium goniopteroides, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dimorphic, with sterile and fertile leaves. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the establishment of dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid habitats."
