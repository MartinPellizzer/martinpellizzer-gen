    "intro": "Phegopteris stegnogramme var. meniscioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a variety of the water fern genus Phegopteris. It is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the surrounding water. The fronds are usually dark green and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its aquatic habitat."
