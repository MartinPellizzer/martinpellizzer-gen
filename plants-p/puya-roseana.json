    "intro": "Puya roseana, commonly known as the Andean lily, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that can reach up to three meters in height. The plant features broad, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, water-holding structure. It produces striking red and orange flowers that bloom once in its lifetime, typically in the summer months. Puya roseana is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and requires specific conditions to thrive."
