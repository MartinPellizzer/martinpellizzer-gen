    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 paucidentatum, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, lobed leaves that resemble ivy leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom throughout the growing season. Native to South Africa, it is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot."
