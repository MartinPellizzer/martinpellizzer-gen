It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces a cluster of follicles containing numerous small, dark seeds. This species is known for its early spring blooming habit, often emerging before the snow has fully melted."
