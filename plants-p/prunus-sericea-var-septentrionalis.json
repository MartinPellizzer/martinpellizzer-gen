    "intro": "Prunus sericea var. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern silky almond, is a shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a finely toothed margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are edible but generally not palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks."
