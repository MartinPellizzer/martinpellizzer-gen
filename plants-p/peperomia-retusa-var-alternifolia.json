    "intro": "Peperomia retusa var. alternifolia, commonly known as the Shiny Cabbage Plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stems, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, followed by tiny, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardens. Its low maintenance and attractive foliage make it a versatile addition to both indoor and outdoor spaces."
