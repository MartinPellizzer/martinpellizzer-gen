It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium subinaequale is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
