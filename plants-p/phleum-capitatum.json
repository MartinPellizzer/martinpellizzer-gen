    "intro": "Phleum capitatum, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters that are tightly packed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Phleum capitatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
