    "intro": "Podochilus longipes f. brevicalcaratus, commonly known as the short-spurred orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive floral morphology. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers with elongated spurs. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to greenish-yellow, with a prominent, short spur that sets it apart from other members of the species. This particular form is notable for its reduced spur length, which is a key distinguishing feature from the typical form of Podochilus longipes."
