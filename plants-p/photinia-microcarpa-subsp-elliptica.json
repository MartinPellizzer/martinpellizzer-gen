It features elliptical to ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in autumn. It is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often used in gardens for its compact growth and seasonal color changes. This subspecies is relatively hardy and adaptable to a variety of soil types."
