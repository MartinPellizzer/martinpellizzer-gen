    "intro": "Paphiopedilum tranlienianum, commonly known as the Tranlien orchid, is a rare and exotic orchid species native to Vietnam. It is characterized by its unique, intricate flower structure, with a lip that is often brightly colored and distinctly shaped. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid, thriving in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are prized for their beauty and fragrance, making it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered endangered in its native range."
