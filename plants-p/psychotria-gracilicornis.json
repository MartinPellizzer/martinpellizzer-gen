    "intro": "Psychotria gracilicornis, commonly known as the slender-horned psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in areas with high humidity and dense vegetation. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. It often grows in shaded understory environments, which contributes to its limited distribution. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
