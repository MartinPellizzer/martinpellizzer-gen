    "intro": "Phragmites communis var. longivalvis, commonly known as the narrowleaf common reed, is a tall, perennial grass found in wetland habitats. It has long, slender leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide, distinguishing it from other varieties of Phragmites. The plant produces dense clusters of feathery, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It thrives in brackish or freshwater environments, often forming extensive stands in marshes and along shorelines. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
