    "intro": "Polypodium obtusilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with broad, rounded lobes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce multiple upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The spores are borne on the undersides of the fertile fronds, which are usually darker in color and more compact than the sterile ones."
