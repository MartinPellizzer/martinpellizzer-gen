    "intro": "Pometia pinnata f. alnifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pometia, is a variant of the pometia tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
