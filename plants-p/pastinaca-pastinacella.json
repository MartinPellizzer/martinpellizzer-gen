    "intro": "Pastinaca pastinacella, commonly known as the wild parsnip, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces a taproot that is typically white or yellowish in color and has a peppery, aromatic flavor. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in open fields. Due to its phototoxic sap, it can cause skin irritation when exposed to sunlight."
