    "intro": "Pleurothallis spathulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically features elongated, narrow leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and its inflorescence consists of a single spike bearing several small to medium-sized blooms. Pleurothallis spathulifolia thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts, though it remains a relatively rare and specialized species in horticulture."
