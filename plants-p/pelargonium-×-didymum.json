It is native to South Africa and is known for its trailing growth habit and ability to form dense mats. The plant features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, which gives it a unique appearance. Its flowers are typically small, tubular, and come in shades of red, pink, and white, often appearing in clusters. Pelargonium \u00d7 didymum is widely cultivated as a decorative plant, particularly in hanging baskets and as ground cover."
