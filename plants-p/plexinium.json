    "intro": "Plexinium, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with five petals and a central cluster of stamens. These plants are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shady environments. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
