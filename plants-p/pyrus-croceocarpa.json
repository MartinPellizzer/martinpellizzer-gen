    "intro": "Pyrus croceocarpa, commonly known as the golden-hued pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that turn a striking yellow in autumn, and its small, yellowish-green fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated. The plant belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other pear species. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and unique coloration, it is occasionally grown in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
