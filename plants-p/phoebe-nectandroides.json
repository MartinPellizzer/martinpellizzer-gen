    "intro": "Phoebe nectandroides, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironwood, is a member of the Lauraceae family and is native to the islands of Hawaii. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by dark blue, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mesic to wet forest habitats. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
