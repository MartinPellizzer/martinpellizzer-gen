    "intro": "Plantago serraria var. hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish plantain, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks. This variant is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
