    "intro": "Populus tacamahacca var. candicans, commonly known as the golden poplar, is a variant of the poplar tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow leaves, which are typically broader and more elongated than those of other poplar species. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves seasonally, and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that aid in wind dispersal. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
