    "intro": "Panicum viscidum, commonly known as sticky bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils. Due to its resilience and ability to form dense stands, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
