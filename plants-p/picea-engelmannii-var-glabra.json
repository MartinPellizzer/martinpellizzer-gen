    "intro": "Picea engelmannii var. glabra, commonly known as the Engelmann spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more rigid than those of other spruce species. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates. The bark of this variety is typically smooth and gray, distinguishing it from other spruce species."
