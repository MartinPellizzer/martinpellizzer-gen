    "intro": "Piper tobagoanum var. humilius, commonly known as the dwarf soursop, is a variant of the soursop plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, spiny fruits. The plant belongs to the Piperaceae family and is closely related to other members of the genus Piper. Its fruit, while smaller than the typical soursop, is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant's botanical features make it a valuable species for both ornamental and medicinal purposes."
