    "intro": "Poa pratensis subsp. irrigata, commonly known as the irrigated meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a dense, sod-forming growth habit. This subspecies is adapted to moist environments, often found in wet meadows and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous system allows it to spread and form extensive turf-like vegetation. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
