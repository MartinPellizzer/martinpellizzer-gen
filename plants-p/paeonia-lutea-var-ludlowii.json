    "intro": "Paeonia lutea var. ludlowii, commonly known as the Ludlow's golden peony, is a rare and striking variant of the golden peony native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a deep green color. It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
