    "intro": "Phallaria horizontalis, commonly known as the flat-stemmed stinkhorn, is a unique fungus that belongs to the Phallaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like cap that develops from a basal stalk. The fungus produces a foul-smelling substance to attract flies, which aid in its spore dispersal. Its fruiting bodies typically appear on decaying wood or soil in moist environments. The plant's structure and reproductive strategy make it an intriguing subject in mycology."
