    "intro": "Polystichum azumiense, commonly known as the Azumi shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that give it a compact, shield-like appearance."
