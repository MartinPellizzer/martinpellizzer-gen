    "intro": "Potentilla laciniosa, commonly known as the fringed cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are finely divided, giving the plant a delicate, lace-like appearance, which is reflected in its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Potentilla laciniosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
