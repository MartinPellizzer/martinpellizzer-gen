    "intro": "Paramagnolia fraseri var. pyramidata, commonly known as the Fraser's pyramid magnolia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its upright, pyramidal growth habit and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a glossy, dark green surface. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique shape and floral display. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
