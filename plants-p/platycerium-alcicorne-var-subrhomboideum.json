    "intro": "Platycerium alcicorne var. subrhomboideum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that emerge from a compact, tree-like base. The plant's fronds are typically dark green with a leathery texture and feature a central midrib that is prominent and often covered in small, spore-producing structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a well-draining substrate to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
