    "intro": "Polygonum hartwrightii, commonly known as Hartwright's knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Polygonum hartwrightii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
