    "intro": "Prunus domestica var. oeconomica, commonly known as the European blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has small, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The berries are used in traditional foods and beverages, though they are generally too bitter for direct consumption."
