    "intro": "Piper multinervium var. skutchii, commonly known as Skutch's pepper vine, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with prominent veins, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy, berry-like structures that turn red when mature, containing several seeds. This species is often found in humid lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
