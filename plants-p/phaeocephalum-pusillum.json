    "intro": "Phaeocephalum pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf pteridium, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas with a Mediterranean climate. The plant has a low-growing habit with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, forming in dense clusters at the base of the plant. Phaeocephalum pusillum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
