    "intro": "Populus eugenii, commonly known as the Mexican poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are followed by cone-like structures that release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. Populus eugenii is valued for its rapid growth and has been used in reforestation efforts due to its ecological benefits."
