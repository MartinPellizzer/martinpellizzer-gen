    "intro": "Pterocaulon subspicatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its root system is adapted to anchor it in rocky soils and access deep water sources. Pterocaulon subspicatum is often found in rocky outcrops and along riverbanks, where it thrives in full sun."
