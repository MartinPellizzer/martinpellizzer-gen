    "intro": "Peperomia tovariana var. subcaespitosa, commonly known as the clustered peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to Central and South America. It features dense clusters of small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and container planting."
