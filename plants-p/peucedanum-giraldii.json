    "intro": "Peucedanum giraldii, commonly known as the Corsican angelica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and distinctive umbellate inflorescences. It is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica, and thrives in moist, calcareous soils. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to greenish flowers clustered in umbrella-like shapes. Its seeds are small, dry, and often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. However, it is important to note that the plant contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
