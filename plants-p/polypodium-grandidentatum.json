    "intro": "Polypodium grandidentatum, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its distinctive morphology and ecological role. The fronds are composed of multiple pinnae, which are arranged in a unique, shield-like pattern."
