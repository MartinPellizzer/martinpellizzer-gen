    "intro": "Plinia inflata, commonly known as the inflated hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant's most distinctive feature is its inflated, seed-filled pods that resemble small balloons, which burst open to release seeds. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
