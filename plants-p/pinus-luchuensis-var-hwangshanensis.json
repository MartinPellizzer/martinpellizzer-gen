    "intro": "Pinus luchuensis var. hwangshanensis, commonly known as the Hwangshan pine, is a rare variant of the Luchu pine native to China. It is characterized by its conical shape and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more clustered than those of the typical species. The tree produces small, woody cones that contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in mountainous regions with well-drained soils and a cool, temperate climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
