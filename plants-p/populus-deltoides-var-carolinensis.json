    "intro": "Populus deltoides var. carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. The Carolina poplar is valued for its rapid growth and ability to stabilize stream banks."
