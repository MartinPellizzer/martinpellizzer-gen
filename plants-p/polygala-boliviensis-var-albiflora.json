It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that are predominantly white or pale yellow. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds."
