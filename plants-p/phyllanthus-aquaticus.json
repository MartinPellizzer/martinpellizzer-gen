    "intro": "Phyllanthus aquaticus, commonly known as water cheesewood, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its fruits are small, three-lobed capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Phyllanthus aquaticus thrives in moist environments and is often found near water bodies such as ponds and streams."
