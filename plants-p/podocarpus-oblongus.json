    "intro": "Podocarpus oblongus, commonly known as the Chinese podocarp, is a species of evergreen coniferous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are leathery in texture. The plant produces cones, which are typically woody and contain seeds, a feature typical of conifers. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. Podocarpus oblongus is also valued for its timber, which is durable and used in construction and furniture-making."
