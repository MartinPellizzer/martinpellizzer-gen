    "intro": "Pleocnemia conjugata, commonly known as the common pleocnemia, is a flowering plant species native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes trees and shrubs characterized by their aromatic wood and medicinal properties. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate in shape. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along riverbanks. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats."
