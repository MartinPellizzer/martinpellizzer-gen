    "intro": "Pinalia scotiifolia, commonly known as the Scottish willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and small, ovate leaves that are typically green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated, and it bears small, red berries in the autumn. Pinalia scotiifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in temperate regions."
