    "intro": "Pholidota imbricata var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved pholidota, is a variant of the pholidota plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is a succulent, meaning it has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, making it drought-tolerant. This variety is valued in horticulture for its unique foliage and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
