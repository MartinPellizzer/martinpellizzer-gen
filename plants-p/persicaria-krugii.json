The plant features erect, hairy stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a prominent central vein. The small, pink to reddish-purple flowers appear in dense clusters at the top of the plant, and they bloom from late summer into early autumn."
