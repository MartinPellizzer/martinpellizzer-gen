    "intro": "Poa virescens, commonly known as green meadow grass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Poa virescens is valued for its ability to form dense turf and its role in ecological restoration projects."
