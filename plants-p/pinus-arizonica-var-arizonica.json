    "intro": "Pinus arizonica var. arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona white pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles that are typically 2 to 4 inches long and bluish-green in color. The tree produces cones that are often 3 to 5 inches long, with reddish-brown scales that open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage and cone structure make it a distinctive species within the pine family."
