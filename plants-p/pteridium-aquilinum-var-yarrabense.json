    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum var. yarrabense, commonly known as the Yarrabene bracken, is a variant of the common bracken fern found in Australia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its large, triangular, and often dark green fronds. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is known for its aggressive growth and can form dense stands in disturbed or open habitats."
