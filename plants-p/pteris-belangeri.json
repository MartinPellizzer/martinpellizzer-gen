    "intro": "Pteris belangeri, commonly known as the Belanger's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often borne on long, creeping rhizomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Pteris belangeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
