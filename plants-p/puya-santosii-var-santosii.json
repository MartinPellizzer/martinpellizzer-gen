    "intro": "Puya santosii var. santosii, commonly known as the Santos' torch, is a striking member of the bromeliad family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can reach several feet in height. The plant produces vibrant, spiky inflorescences with bright red bracts, which are showy but not edible. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens."
