It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers, which are often clustered in dense groups. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and riparian zones, and is adapted to seasonal flooding. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
