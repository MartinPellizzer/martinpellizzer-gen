    "intro": "Prunus neustriensis, commonly known as the Neustrian cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark red fruits that are edible but not as widely cultivated as other cherry species. It is often found in woodland areas and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant for gardens and landscapes."
