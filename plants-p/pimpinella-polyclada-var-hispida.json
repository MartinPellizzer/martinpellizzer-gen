    "intro": "Pimpinella polyclada var. hispida, commonly known as the hispid pimpinella, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescences. The plant features finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its small white or greenish flowers bloom in clusters, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. The seeds are small and dry, typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution."
