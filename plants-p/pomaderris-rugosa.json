    "intro": "Pomaderris rugosa, commonly known as the rough pomaderris, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Pomaderris rugosa is often found in dry, open forests and woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
