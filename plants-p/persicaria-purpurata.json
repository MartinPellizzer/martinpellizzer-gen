    "intro": "Persicaria purpurata, commonly known as the redroot sedum, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features upright, branching stems that are often reddish-purple in color, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Persicaria purpurata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
