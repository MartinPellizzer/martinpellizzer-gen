    "intro": "Poa frigida, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a cold-tolerant grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant typically forms dense mats or cushions, allowing it to retain heat and moisture in nutrient-poor soils. Poa frigida is adapted to low temperatures and can thrive in areas with limited sunlight. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
