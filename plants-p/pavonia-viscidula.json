    "intro": "Pavonia viscidula, commonly known as sticky pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glandular-hairy stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces showy, red or pink bract-like flowers that are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Pavonia viscidula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
