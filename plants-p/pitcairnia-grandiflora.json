    "intro": "Pitcairnia grandiflora, commonly known as the giant pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, featuring vibrant red or orange flowers. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pitcairnia grandiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited for indoor or greenhouse environments."
