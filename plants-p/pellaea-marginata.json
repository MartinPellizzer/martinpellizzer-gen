    "intro": "Pellaea marginata, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. The silver fern is not only ornamental but also holds cultural significance in M\u0101ori traditions."
