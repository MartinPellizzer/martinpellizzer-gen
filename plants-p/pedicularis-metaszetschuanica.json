    "intro": "Pedicularis metaszetschuanica, commonly known as the Sichuan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, adapted for pollination by insects. Its leaves are usually alternate and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
