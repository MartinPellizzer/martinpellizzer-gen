    "intro": "Pyrrosia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean rock fern, is a species of fern native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is a small, epiphytic plant that grows on tree trunks and branches, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. The plant has leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of spores. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important component of Borneo's biodiversity."
