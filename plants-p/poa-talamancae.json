    "intro": "Poa talamancae, commonly known as the Talamanca grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high Andean regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed florets. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with low temperatures and strong sunlight. Poa talamancae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, grass-like appearance."
