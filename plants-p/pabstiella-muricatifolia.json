    "intro": "Pabstiella muricatifolia, commonly known as the spiny leaf orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in small, sharp spines, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrate, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Pabstiella muricatifolia is considered a rare and endangered species."
