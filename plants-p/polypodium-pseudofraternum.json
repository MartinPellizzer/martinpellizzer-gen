    "intro": "Polypodium pseudofraternum, commonly known as the false staghorn fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is an epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees, using them for support rather than deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a fleshy, tree-like structure and large, leathery fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and indirect light. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
