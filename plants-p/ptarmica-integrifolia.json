    "intro": "Ptarmica integrifolia, commonly known as the northern bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, creeping stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with smooth or slightly toothed margins. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Ptarmica integrifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has been historically used in traditional herbal remedies for its mild astringent properties."
