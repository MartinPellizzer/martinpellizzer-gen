    "intro": "Pandanus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf pandanus, is a small shrub native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a compact rosette near the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by spiny, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in wet or brackish environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping and traditional crafts in its native regions."
