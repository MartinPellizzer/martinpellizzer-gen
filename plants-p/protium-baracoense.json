    "intro": "Protium baracoense, commonly known as the Malabar chestnut, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The tree produces edible fruits that are encased in a thick, woody husk, which contain a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in dense forests. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native habitat."
