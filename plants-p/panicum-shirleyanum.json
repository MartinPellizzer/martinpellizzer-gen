    "intro": "Panicum shirleyanum, commonly known as Shirley panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery, silver-green plumes that give it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Its growth habit is clump-forming, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. The plant is often used as an ornamental grass due to its elegant, upright form and seasonal color changes."
