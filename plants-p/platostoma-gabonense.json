    "intro": "Platostoma gabonense, commonly known as the Gabon shield fern, is a species of fern native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in water absorption. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, a unique trait that helps the plant attract nocturnal pollinators."
