    "intro": "Pastinaca nudicaulis, commonly known as the slender bur marigold, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and foliage with a distinctive, often hairy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a rough or glandular surface. The showy yellow flowers appear in late summer and are followed by spiky, bur-like seed heads that aid in seed dispersal."
