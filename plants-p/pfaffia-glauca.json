    "intro": "Pfaffia glauca, commonly known as Paraguay tea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by small, round, greenish fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often grown for its leaves, which are used to make a herbal tea. Pfaffia glauca is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though more research is needed to confirm its efficacy."
