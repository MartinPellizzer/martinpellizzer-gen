    "intro": "Phedimus odontophyllus, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing perennial groundcover native to China. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silvery-white undersides that create a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue to black berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
