    "intro": "Platanthera altigena, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a slender, leafless stem that typically grows up to 60 centimeters in height. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are usually violet to purple in color, with a distinctive, narrow labellum. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. This species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and marshes."
