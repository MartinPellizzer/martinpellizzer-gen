    "intro": "Potentilla roemeri, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with wiry stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its foliage consists of serrated, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, aiding in water retention. Potentilla roemeri plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a component of alpine plant communities."
