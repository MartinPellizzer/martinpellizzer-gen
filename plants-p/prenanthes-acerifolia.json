It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive red veins, which become more pronounced in cooler weather. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking shade-tolerant, ornamental plants."
