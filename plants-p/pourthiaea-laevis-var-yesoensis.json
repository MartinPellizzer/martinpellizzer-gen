    "intro": "Pourthiaea laevis var. yesoensis, commonly known as the Yeso sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Korea. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
