    "intro": "Polypodium soromanes, commonly known as the Japanese wall fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are often used in traditional Japanese gardens. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
