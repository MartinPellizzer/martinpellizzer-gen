    "intro": "Panicum piluliferum, commonly known as little barley, is a grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, three-angled seeds that are often referred to as \"little barley grains.\" It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along creek banks. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural areas."
