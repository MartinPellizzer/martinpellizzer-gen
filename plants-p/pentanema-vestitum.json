    "intro": "Pentanema vestitum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain areas."
