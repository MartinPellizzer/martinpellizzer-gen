It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often twisted leaves that resemble a whip, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne on the stems rather than on separate branches. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. The species is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional medicine for various health purposes."
