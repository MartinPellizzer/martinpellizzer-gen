    "intro": "Polygala myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its native environment. Polygala myrtifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and unique floral display."
