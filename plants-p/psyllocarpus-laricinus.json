It is characterized by its aromatic leaves that emit a pleasant fragrance, especially when crushed. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are edible and often consumed raw or cooked. Its botanical features include simple, alternate leaves with a leathery texture and a shallow root system. Psyllocarpus laricinus is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
