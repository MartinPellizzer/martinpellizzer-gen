    "intro": "Polypodium sharpianum, commonly known as the Sharp's hart's-tongue fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery, and deeply divided fronds that resemble the shape of a tongue. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments, preferring well-drained soil. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Polypodium sharpianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
