    "intro": "Phoradendron semivenosum var. longipes, commonly known as the long-veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, ovate leaves that are often clustered at the ends of its twining stems. The plant produces white, waxy flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while also contributing to the ecosystem through seed dispersal and providing food for wildlife. The species is notable for its adaptability and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
