    "intro": "Pentapogon micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered starwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers with five stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The species is notable for its delicate appearance and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
