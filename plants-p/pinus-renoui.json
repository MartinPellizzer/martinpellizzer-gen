    "intro": "Pinus renoui, commonly known as the Renou's pine, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are woody and often remain attached to the branches for many years. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
