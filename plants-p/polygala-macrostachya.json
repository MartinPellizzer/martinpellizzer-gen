    "intro": "Polygala macrostachya, commonly known as the large-stemmed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with small, pea-like flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often hairy, while the flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white. The plant is notable for its unique seed pods, which are elongated and twisted, aiding in seed dispersal by wind or animals."
