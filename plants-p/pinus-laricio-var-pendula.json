    "intro": "Pinus laricio var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping stone pine, is a unique variant of the stone pine species. It is characterized by its pendulous, drooping branches that give it a distinctive, cascading appearance. This evergreen conifer is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of long, needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly curved. The tree produces edible pine nuts, making it both ornamental and economically valuable."
