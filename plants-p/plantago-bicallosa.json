    "intro": "Plantago bicallosa, commonly known as the two-bristled plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its mucilage-rich leaves, which have been used traditionally for their soothing properties."
