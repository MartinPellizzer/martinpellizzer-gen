    "intro": "Pinus fallax, commonly known as the Florida torreya, is a rare conifer native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Due to its limited range and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
