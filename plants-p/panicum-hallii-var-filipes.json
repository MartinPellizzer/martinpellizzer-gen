It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that resemble plumes. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in wet or seasonally flooded areas. Its ornamental value is due to its fine, silky texture and graceful appearance."
