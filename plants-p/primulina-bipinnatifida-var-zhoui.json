    "intro": "Primulina bipinnatifida var. zhoui, commonly known as the Zhou's bipinnate primulina, is a rare and ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with a finely divided, bipinnatifid margin. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is a sought-after species among botanists and plant enthusiasts."
