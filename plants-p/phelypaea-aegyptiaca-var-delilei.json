    "intro": "Phelypaea aegyptiaca var. delilei, commonly known as the Egyptian water clover, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in Egypt and surrounding regions. It is characterized by its dense, floating foliage with small, heart-shaped leaves that form a mat on the water surface. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
