    "intro": "Pilocereus swartzii, commonly known as the night bloomer cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it highly drought-resistant. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
