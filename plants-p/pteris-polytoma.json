    "intro": "Pteris polytoma, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a light green color and a slightly serrated edge. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or rocky surfaces. Pteris polytoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
