    "intro": "Pitcairnia subfuscopetala, commonly known as the dark-petioled pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Pitcairnia subfuscopetala is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
