    "intro": "Pleopeltis aquatica, commonly known as the aquatic pleopeltis, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. It typically grows on submerged or partially submerged surfaces such as rocks or logs in freshwater environments. The plant has delicate, linear fronds that are often submerged, with a rhizome that anchors it to its substrate. It is known for its ability to thrive in slow-moving or still water, making it a common sight in marshy areas and ponds. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms."
