    "intro": "Pedicularis fargesii, commonly known as the Chinese lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking red or purple flowers that resemble small lanterns. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its specialized roots. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in alpine flora."
