    "intro": "Phlox hoodii subsp. lanata, commonly known as the woolly phlox, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
