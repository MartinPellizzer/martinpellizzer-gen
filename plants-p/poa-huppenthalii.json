    "intro": "Poa huppenthalii, commonly known as Huppenthal's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern South America. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it contributes to stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
