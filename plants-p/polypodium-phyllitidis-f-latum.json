    "intro": "Polypodium phyllitidis f. latum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and habitat preferences. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, humid environments, often found on cliffs or walls. Its fronds are leathery and have a broad, lanceolate shape, with a serrated margin that distinguishes it from other similar species. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium."
