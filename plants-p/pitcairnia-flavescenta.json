    "intro": "Pitcairnia flavescenta, commonly known as the yellow pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with a yellowish or reddish hue, depending on the light conditions. The plant produces vibrant orange or yellow flowers that bloom in the center of the leaf rosette, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pitcairnia flavescenta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
