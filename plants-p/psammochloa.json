    "intro": "Psammochloa, commonly known as desert grass or sand grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, featuring narrow, tough leaves that reduce water loss. Psammochloa species typically grow in sandy or gravelly soils, often forming dense mats or clumps. Their roots are extensive, helping to stabilize dunes and prevent soil erosion. The genus includes several species, such as *Psammochloa orientalis*, which is native to regions of Asia and the Middle East."
