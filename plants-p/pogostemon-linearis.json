    "intro": "Pogostemon linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pogostemon, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, linear leaves that are often aromatic and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common sight in its natural habitat."
