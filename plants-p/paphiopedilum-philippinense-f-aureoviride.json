    "intro": "Paphiopedilum philippinense f. aureoviride, commonly known as the golden green lady's slipper, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the Philippines. It is distinguished by its striking, vivid green and yellow floral lip, which is a key feature of the slipper orchid family. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a sympodial growth habit, producing multiple pseudobulbs and leaves. Its flowers are usually small to medium in size and bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited natural habitat and rarity, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
