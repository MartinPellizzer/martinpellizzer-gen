    "intro": "Pteris aspera, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are covered with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Pteris aspera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
