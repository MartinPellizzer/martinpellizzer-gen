    "intro": "Pteris mettenii, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are produced in small, round sori located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris mettenii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a decorative plant."
