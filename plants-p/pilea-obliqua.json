    "intro": "Pilea obliqua, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to southern China. It features rosettes of glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, usually greenish-white in color, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Pilea obliqua is relatively low maintenance and is often cultivated for its attractive foliage rather than its flowers."
