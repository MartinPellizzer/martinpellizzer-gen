    "intro": "Pogonia ravenii, commonly known as the black ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, almost black petals and sepals, which give it its ominous appearance. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees in moist, shaded environments, forming a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered threatened and is protected in many regions."
