    "intro": "Pseudobarleria canescens, commonly known as the hairy barleria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant features slender, erect stems covered in fine, silky hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple, blooming from late spring to early autumn. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptation."
