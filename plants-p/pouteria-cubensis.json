    "intro": "Pouteria cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban sapote, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The tree produces an edible fruit with a thick, yellowish rind and a sweet, creamy pulp that is sometimes compared to a mix of persimmon and banana. Its fruit is rich in nutrients, including vitamins A and C, and is often used in culinary applications. The plant also has a significant role in local ecosystems and traditional medicine."
