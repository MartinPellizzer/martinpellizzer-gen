    "intro": "Polygonella ciliata var. basiramia, commonly known as the Basiramia sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, particularly in regions of China and the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
