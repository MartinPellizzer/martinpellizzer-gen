    "intro": "Pellionia balansae, commonly known as the velvetleaf pellionia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale green flowers, often subtended by bracts. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Pellionia balansae is often cultivated as a ground cover or in hanging baskets due to its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
