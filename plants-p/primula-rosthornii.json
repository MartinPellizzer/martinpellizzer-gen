    "intro": "Primula rosthornii, commonly known as the Rosthorn's primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually oval or lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Primula rosthornii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
