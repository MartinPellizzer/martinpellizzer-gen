    "intro": "Psammotropha quadrangularis var. mucronata, commonly known as the mucronate sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, ribbed stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically small, opposite, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This species is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats."
