    "intro": "Pinus mughus var. obliqua, commonly known as the Kashmir pine, is a rare variant of the Himalayan pine native to the higher altitudes of the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles and conical shape, which help it withstand harsh mountainous conditions. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in traditional construction and craftsmanship. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
