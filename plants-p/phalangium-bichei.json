    "intro": "Phalangium bichei, commonly known as the Biche's centipede, is a species of centipede belonging to the family Scolopendridae. It is characterized by its elongated, segmented body and numerous pairs of jointed legs, typical of centipedes. The plant-like appearance of its body can sometimes lead to confusion with certain arthropods or even plants. It thrives in moist, humid environments, often found in leaf litter or under rocks. While not a plant, it plays a role in soil aeration and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
