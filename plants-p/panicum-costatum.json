    "intro": "Panicum costatum, commonly known as the silky grass or silky panicum, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that cover its stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lipped flowers that are often tinged with red or purple. Panicum costatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in wetland ecosystems."
