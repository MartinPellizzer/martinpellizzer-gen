It is characterized by its distinctive variegated leaves, which display a mix of white, yellow, and green patterns. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red, juicy berries that are attractive to birds. It is typically found in moist, woodland areas and thrives in partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
