    "intro": "Pterocarpus rupestris, commonly known as the rock ebony, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hard timber, it is valued for furniture and traditional crafts, though it faces threats from overharvesting."
