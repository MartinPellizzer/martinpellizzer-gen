    "intro": "Phalaenopsis marriottiana var. parishii, commonly known as the Parish's phalaenopsis, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, gracefully arching inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its foliage consists of broad, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively low maintenance requirements in cultivation."
