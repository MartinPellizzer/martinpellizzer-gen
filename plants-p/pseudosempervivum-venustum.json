It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or container planting. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular ornamental plant in arid and semi-arid climates."
