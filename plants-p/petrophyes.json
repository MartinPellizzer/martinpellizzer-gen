    "intro": "Petrophyes, commonly known as the rock hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that come in a range of colors including red, yellow, and white. These plants are typically found in arid or rocky environments, where they have adapted to survive with minimal water. Petrophyes species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value. Their ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes them an important component of desert and semi-desert ecosystems."
