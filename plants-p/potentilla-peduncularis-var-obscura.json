    "intro": "Potentilla peduncularis var. obscura, commonly known as the dark-stemmed cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
