    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium conoideum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue, and the stems are erect and branched. Pseudognaphalium conoideum is often used in native plant gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
