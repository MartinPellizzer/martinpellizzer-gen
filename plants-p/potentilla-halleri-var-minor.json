    "intro": "Potentilla halleri var. minor, commonly known as the lesser potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has herringbone-patterned leaves with a distinctive, finely serrated margin. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
