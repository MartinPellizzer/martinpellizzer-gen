    "intro": "Pitcairnia weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Pitcairnia weberbaueri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is appreciated in both horticulture and botanical gardens."
