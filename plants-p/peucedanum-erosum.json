It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its seeds are enclosed in a dry, ribbed fruit and are dispersed by wind. Peucedanum erosum is often found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia."
