    "intro": "Pulegium vulgare f. serratum, commonly known as narrow-leaved pennyroyal, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves with serrated edges and clusters of tiny, pale blue or white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, have been traditionally used for their aromatic and medicinal properties. However, it is important to note that the plant can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
