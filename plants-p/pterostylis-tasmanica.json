    "intro": "Pterostylis tasmanica, commonly known as the Tasmanian duck orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Tasmania. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, pale green or yellowish flower that resembles a duck's bill. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, primarily thysanoptera, due to their unique structure. The species is of conservation interest due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity."
