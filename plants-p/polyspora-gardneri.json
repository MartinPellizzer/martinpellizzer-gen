    "intro": "Polyspora gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's polypody, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizome is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
