    "intro": "Pleopeltis juglandifolia, commonly known as the chestnut-leaf huperzia, is a species of moss in the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-shaped leaves that resemble the leaves of chestnut trees, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporophytes are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive, elongated capsule that matures to release spores. Pleopeltis juglandifolia is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in maintaining soil moisture and supporting local biodiversity."
