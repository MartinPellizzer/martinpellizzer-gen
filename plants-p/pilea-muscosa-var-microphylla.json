    "intro": "Pilea muscosa var. microphylla, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are smaller than those of the standard Pilea muscosa, giving it a more delicate appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
