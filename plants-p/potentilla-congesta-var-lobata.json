    "intro": "Potentilla congesta var. lobata, commonly known as the broadleaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are often lobed, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
