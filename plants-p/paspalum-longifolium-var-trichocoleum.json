    "intro": "Paspalum longifolium var. trichocoleum, commonly known as the hairy paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
