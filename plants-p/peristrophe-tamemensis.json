The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Peristrophe tamemensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its elegant, wind-swaying foliage."
