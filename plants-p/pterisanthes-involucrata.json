    "intro": "Pterisanthes involucrata, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America and parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
