    "intro": "Pterocarpus microcarpus, commonly known as the small-fruited ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and distinctive leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and durable timber."
