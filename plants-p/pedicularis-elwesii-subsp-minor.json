It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers with a distinctive spurred petal. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes. Its botanical features include slender stems, lance-shaped leaves, and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer."
