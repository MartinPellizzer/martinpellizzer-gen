    "intro": "Polypodium fallax var. margaritiferum, commonly known as the \"pearl fern,\" is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are often covered with small, bead-like structures called sori, which contain the spores. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or wooded substrates. The varietal name \"margaritiferum\" refers to the bead-like spore cases, which are a distinctive feature of this species."
