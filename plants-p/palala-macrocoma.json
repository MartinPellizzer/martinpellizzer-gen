It is characterized by its large, fleshy leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically bright yellow or orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
