    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. concolor, commonly known as the white cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-white leaves that reflect light and give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
