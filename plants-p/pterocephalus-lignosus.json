    "intro": "Pterocephalus lignosus, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a distinctive botanical feature and can be toxic if ingested. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
