    "intro": "Poa blepharophora, commonly known as the fringed meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often pale green or brown in color. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Poa blepharophora is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
