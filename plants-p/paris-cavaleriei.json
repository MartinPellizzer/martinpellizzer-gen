    "intro": "Paris cavaleriei, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant native to China. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, floating leaves that resemble those of a water lily. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with flowers that are typically green or white. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
