    "intro": "Pyrus atrimontis, commonly known as the Atrimontian pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly the Carpathian Basin. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, with simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval in shape. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces edible pomes that are similar to common pears. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
