    "intro": "Petasites doerfleri, commonly known as the giant buttercup, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and Pyrenees. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, and its showy, yellow flowers with numerous stamens. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a notable species in high-altitude botanical studies."
