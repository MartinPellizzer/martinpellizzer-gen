    "intro": "Polygala compacta, commonly known as the compact milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Polygala compacta is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
