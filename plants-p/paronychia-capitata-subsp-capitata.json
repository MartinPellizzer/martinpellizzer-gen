    "intro": "Paronychia capitata subsp. capitata, commonly known as the clustered cushion plant, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that form a compact cushion. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in terminal clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its succulent leaves and compact growth habit make it an attractive and drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
