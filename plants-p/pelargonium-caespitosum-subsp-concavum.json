    "intro": "Pelargonium caespitosum subsp. concavum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved geranium, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright, compact growth with small, ovate leaves that have a slightly curled margin. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
