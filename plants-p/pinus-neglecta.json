    "intro": "Pinus neglecta, commonly known as the coastal Douglas fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Pinus neglecta thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salty air and strong winds. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh weather conditions."
