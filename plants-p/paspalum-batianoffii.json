It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas or along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
