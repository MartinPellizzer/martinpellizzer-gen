    "intro": "Polypodium xiphias, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow fronds that resemble a sword, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Polypodium xiphias is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
