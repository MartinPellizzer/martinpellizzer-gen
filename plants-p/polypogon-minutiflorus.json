    "intro": "Polypogon minutiflorus, commonly known as the smallflower panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense clumps, and its tiny, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue. Polypogon minutiflorus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in wetland ecosystems."
