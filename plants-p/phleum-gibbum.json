    "intro": "Phleum gibbum, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in moist, temperate environments. It has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in shaded woodland areas. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Phleum gibbum is also a valuable forage plant for livestock."
