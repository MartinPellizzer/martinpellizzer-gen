    "intro": "Pseudopodospermum undulatum subsp. deliciosum, commonly known as the sweetleaf cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that are often a deep green. The plant produces cones, with the male cones bearing numerous yellowish filaments and the female cones developing into woody, spiny seed pods. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
