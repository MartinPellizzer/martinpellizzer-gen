    "intro": "Pseudoprosopis uncinata, commonly known as the desert shrub or catclaw acacia, is a drought-tolerant plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release small, hooked seeds, which aid in wind dispersal. Pseudoprosopis uncinata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
