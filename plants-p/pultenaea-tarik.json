    "intro": "Pultenaea tarik, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wattle, is a shrub native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often glandular, leaves that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spikes and attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and rocky areas. Pultenaea tarik is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowering display."
