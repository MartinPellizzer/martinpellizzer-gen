It features broad, ovate leaves with serrated edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in clusters. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a suitable houseplant. Its ornamental value lies primarily in its foliage rather than its flowers."
