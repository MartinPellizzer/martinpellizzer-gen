    "intro": "Paspalum littorale, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Americas. It thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found in dune ecosystems and tidal marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers. It is well adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding, making it an important pioneer species in coastal restoration. Its dense growth helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion along shorelines."
