    "intro": "Pectis uniaristata var. uniaristata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pectis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows from a woody base, forming a low, sprawling shrub. It is adapted to hot, dry environments and has deep roots to access water. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in arid landscapes."
