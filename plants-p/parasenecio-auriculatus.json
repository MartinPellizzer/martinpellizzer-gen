    "intro": "Parasenecio auriculatus, commonly known as the auriculate parasenecio, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and have prominent auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes at the base. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract various pollinators. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
