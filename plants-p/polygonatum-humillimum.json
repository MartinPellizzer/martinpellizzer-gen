    "intro": "Polygonatum humillimum, commonly known as the dwarf Solomon's seal, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the forests of eastern North America. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The plant produces slender, arching stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. Small, greenish-white flowers appear in the spring, followed by red berries that ripen in the summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland understories."
