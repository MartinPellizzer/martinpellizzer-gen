It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow petals and bract-like leaves. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its unique floral structure and vibrant color make it a notable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
