    "intro": "Pfaffia luzuliflora subsp. squarrosa, commonly known as the Brazilian arrowroot, is a perennial herb native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes ginger and turmeric, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes are often harvested for their starchy, edible roots, which have been traditionally used in local cuisines. The subspecies squarrosa is distinguished by its rounded, scaly leaf bases and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
