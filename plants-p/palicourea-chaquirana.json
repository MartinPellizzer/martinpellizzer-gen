    "intro": "Palicourea chaquirana, commonly known as the Andean moonflower, is a climbing shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves, which are typically elliptical to ovate in shape. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, often opening at night, which is a common trait among moonflowers. The plant is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
