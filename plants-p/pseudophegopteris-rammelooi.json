    "intro": "Pseudophegopteris rammelooi, commonly known as the Rammeloo's water fern, is a rare aquatic fern species native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, narrow segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
