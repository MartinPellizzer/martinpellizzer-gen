    "intro": "Polypodium rudimentum, commonly known as the rudimentum fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests and along stream banks. Polypodium rudimentum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
