    "intro": "Pisonia darwinii, commonly known as the Darwin's pisonia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble clusters of small, lantern-like flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive tubular shape, and it produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Pisonia darwinii is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to grow in sandy or limestone soils."
