    "intro": "Pandanus luteus, commonly known as the yellow pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender leaves that are typically bright yellow to orange in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible fruits known as \"breadfruit.\" Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The yellow pandanus is well adapted to coastal and lowland environments, thriving in sandy soils and high humidity."
