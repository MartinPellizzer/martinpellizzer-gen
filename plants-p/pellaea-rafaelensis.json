    "intro": "Pellaea rafaelensis, commonly known as the Rafael's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, often glossy fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or mountainous habitats. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
