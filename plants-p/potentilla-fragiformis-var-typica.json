It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous flowering stems that bear small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The leaves are typically silver-white on the upper surface and dark green underneath, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant is adapted to harsh conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky and arid habitats."
