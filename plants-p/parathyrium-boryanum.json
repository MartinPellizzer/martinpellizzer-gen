    "intro": "Parathyrium boryanum, commonly known as the Boryanum fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features a creeping rhizome with erect, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
