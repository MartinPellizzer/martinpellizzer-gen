It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is covered in short, spiny bristles. The plant produces vibrant orange flowers during the dry season, which attract various pollinators. Its succulent stems store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
