    "intro": "Piper excessum, commonly known as the giant pepper plant, is a climbing shrub native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species like black pepper. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its fruit, which resembles a peppercorn, is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. However, it is less commonly cultivated than other pepper varieties due to its specific growing requirements."
