It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ability to produce new shoots from the base allows for easy propagation through stem cuttings."
