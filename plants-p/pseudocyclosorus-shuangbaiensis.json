    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus shuangbaiensis, commonly known as the Shuangbai water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to China. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with spores produced in specialized organs called sporocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
