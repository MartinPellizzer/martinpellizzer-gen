It features slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
