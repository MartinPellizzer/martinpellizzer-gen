It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescences that range in color from green to purple. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its adaptability in various soil types. It thrives in full sun and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields.
