    "intro": "Psidium aquaticum, commonly known as the water guava, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces edible berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. These berries are rich in vitamin C and have a tangy, slightly sweet flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies in its natural habitat."
