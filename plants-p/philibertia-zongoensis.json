    "intro": "Philibertia zongoensis, commonly known as the Zongo's filbert, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to retain moisture in its harsh environment. The flowers, which bloom in late summer, are usually yellow or orange and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
