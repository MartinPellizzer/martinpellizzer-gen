    "intro": "Potentilla recta proles obscura, commonly known as the obscure upright potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features dense, sprawling growth with small, dark green leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer, which are relatively inconspicuous compared to its more showy relatives. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soils and low moisture conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy, low-maintenance plant suitable for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
