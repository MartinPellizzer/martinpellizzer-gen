    "intro": "Petiveria alliacea var. octandra, commonly known as the \"Mexican garlic\" or \"chamomile weed,\" is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a low-growing annual herb with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a strong, pungent odor. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it both a weed and a plant with potential medicinal uses."
