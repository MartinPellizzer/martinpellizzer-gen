    "intro": "Polystichum panigrahianum, commonly known as the Panigrahian shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Nepal. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, shield-like shape. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
