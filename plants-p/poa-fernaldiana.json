    "intro": "Poa fernaldiana, commonly known as Fernald's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, typically forming dense, low-growing sods. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often hidden within the foliage, making it difficult to spot. Poa fernaldiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
