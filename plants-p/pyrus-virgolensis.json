    "intro": "Pyrus virgolensis, commonly known as the Virgin's thorn or Virgin's apple, is a small deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20135 meters and features alternate, simple, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-sour apples that ripen in late summer. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Pyrus virgolensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional medicine."
