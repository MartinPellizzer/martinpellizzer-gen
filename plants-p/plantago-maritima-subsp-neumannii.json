    "intro": "Plantago maritima subsp. neumannii, commonly known as the coastal plantain, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in a spike and are pollinated by wind. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh coastal environments and plays a role in stabilizing dune systems."
