    "intro": "Pisonia petiolaris, commonly known as the red-flowered pisonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal and humid forest environments. The plant is characterized by its showy, clustered pink or red flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly waxy texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
