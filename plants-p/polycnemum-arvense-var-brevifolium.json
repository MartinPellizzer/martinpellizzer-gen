    "intro": "Polycnemum arvense var. brevifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved field sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in width. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in inflorescences at the top of the stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along roadsides. This variant is distinguished from other polycnemum species by its shorter, broader leaves and specific habitat preferences."
