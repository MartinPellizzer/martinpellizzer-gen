    "intro": "Panicum molokaiense, commonly known as Molokai grass, is a perennial grass native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of Hawaii. Molokai grass is often used in traditional Hawaiian landscaping and is valued for its ornamental and cultural significance."
