    "intro": "Pandanus terrireginae, commonly known as the Teneriffe pandanus, is a rare and unique species native to the island of Teneriffe in the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family, characterized by its feather-like leaves and robust, fibrous structure. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to salt-laden winds. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
