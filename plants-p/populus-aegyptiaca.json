    "intro": "Populus aegyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the Nile Valley and parts of the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources. Due to its adaptability, it has been cultivated in various arid and semi-arid regions for ornamental and ecological purposes."
