    "intro": "Pinguicula caerulea, commonly known as the blue hound's mouth, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity to flourish. Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
