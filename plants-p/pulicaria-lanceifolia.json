    "intro": "Pulicaria lanceifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Pulicaria lanceifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
