    "intro": "Platanus orientalis var. insularis, commonly known as the Mediterranean plane tree, is a variant of the oriental plane tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is a large, deciduous tree characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, palmate venation. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. Its bark is thick, fissured, and often covered in lichens, giving it a rugged appearance. This variant is well adapted to coastal and urban environments, making it a common sight in parks and along streets in southern Europe."
