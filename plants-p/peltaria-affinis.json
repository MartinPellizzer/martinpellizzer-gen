    "intro": "Peltaria affinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf pellitory, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. Peltaria affinis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
