    "intro": "Polypodium solidum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that often grow on rocks or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically leathery and dark green, with a distinctive, upright growth pattern. Polypodium solidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
