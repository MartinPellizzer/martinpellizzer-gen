    "intro": "Polypodium willdenowii, commonly known as the willdenow's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. The plant's rhizome is fibrous and helps it anchor to rocky or soil surfaces."
