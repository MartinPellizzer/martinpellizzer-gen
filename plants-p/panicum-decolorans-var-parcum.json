    "intro": "Panicum decolorans var. parcum, commonly known as the slender false panicgrass, is a grass species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green to brownish leaves that often appear withered. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It produces fluffy, seed-bearing inflorescences that are often mistaken for other grasses. Due to its low-growing habit and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in landscaping or restoration projects."
