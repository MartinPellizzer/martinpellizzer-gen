The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and marshes. It has separate male and female flowers, which are often found on different stems, a feature known as dioecy. Its small, inconspicuous flowers produce seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its propagation in wetland environments."
