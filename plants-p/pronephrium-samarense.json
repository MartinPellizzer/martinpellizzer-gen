    "intro": "Pronephrium samarense, commonly known as the Samarensis kidney fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and the fronds are often arching, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Pronephrium samarense is valued for its aesthetic qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
