    "intro": "Primula obconica var. nigroglandulosa, commonly known as the black glandular primula, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant's unique feature is the presence of black glandular structures on its leaves and stems, which are responsible for its common name.
