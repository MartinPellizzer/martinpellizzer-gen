It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, often blue or purple, star-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically broad and succulent, adapted to arid environments. Platytheca species are native to regions of Africa, southern Europe, and western Asia. They are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are valued for their ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
