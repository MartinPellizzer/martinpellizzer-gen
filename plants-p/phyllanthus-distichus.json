    "intro": "Phyllanthus distichus, commonly known as the two-ranked phyllanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruits are capsule-like structures containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or used in traditional medicine."
