    "intro": "Paesia, commonly known as the \"white heath,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their evergreen leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. Paesia species are native to regions in Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. They are well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in acidic and well-drained conditions. The flowers, which range in color from white to pink, attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
