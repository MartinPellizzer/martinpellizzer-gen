    "intro": "Pitcairnia pavonii, commonly known as the pavonii\u51e4\u68a8, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble a crown, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a small pool for aquatic organisms. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, emerging from the center of the rosette. Pitcairnia pavonii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental beauty in botanical gardens and collections."
