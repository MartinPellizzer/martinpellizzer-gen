It is native to Australia and is characterized by its woody stems and aromatic leaves. The plants typically grow in dry, rocky habitats and are well adapted to arid conditions. They produce small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Polypleurella species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and resilience."
