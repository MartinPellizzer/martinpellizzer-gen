    "intro": "Pereskia acardia, commonly known as the cactus tree, is a unique plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems that resemble tree trunks. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often mistaken for leaves, but they are actually modified stems. Its flowers are typically yellow or white and bloom in the summer months. Pereskia acardia is well adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems for long periods."
