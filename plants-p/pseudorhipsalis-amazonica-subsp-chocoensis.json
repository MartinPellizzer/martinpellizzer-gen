    "intro": "Pseudorhipsalis amazonica subsp. chocoensis, commonly known as the Chocoan star cactus, is a rare epiphytic cactus native to the tropical rainforests of western Colombia. It features short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps protect it from excessive sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season, adding a delicate floral display to its foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
