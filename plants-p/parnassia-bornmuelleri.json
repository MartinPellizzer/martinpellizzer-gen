    "intro": "Parnassia bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with a distinctive white center, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
