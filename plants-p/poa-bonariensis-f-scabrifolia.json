    "intro": "Poa bonariensis f. scabrifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf meadowgrass, is a variant of the common meadowgrass native to South America. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance compared to the typical smooth-leafed form. The plant produces dense, tufted growth with slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its unique foliage, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and landscapes."
