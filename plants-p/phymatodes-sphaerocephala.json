    "intro": "Phymatodes sphaerocephala, commonly known as the globe-shaped bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its specialized bladders for nutrient absorption. It thrives in nutrient-poor water, using its prey to supplement its diet. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
