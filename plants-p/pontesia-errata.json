    "intro": "Pontesia errata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and practical properties."
