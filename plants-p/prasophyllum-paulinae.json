    "intro": "Prasophyllum paulinae, commonly known as the Pauline leek orchid, is an endemic species found in the south-eastern region of Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in heathland and forested areas, often in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces a single, slender stem that bears a single, white to pale green flower. Its leaves are grass-like and form a rosette at the base of the plant. Prasophyllum paulinae is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and degradation."
