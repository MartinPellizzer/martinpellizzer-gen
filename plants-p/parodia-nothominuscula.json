    "intro": "Parodia nothominuscula, commonly known as the miniature parodia, is a small, globular cactus native to southern Africa. It features a compact, rounded stem with a smooth, pale green surface that often has a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the top of the stem. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
