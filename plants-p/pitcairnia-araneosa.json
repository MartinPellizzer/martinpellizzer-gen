    "intro": "Pitcairnia araneosa, commonly known as the Spider Pitcher, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiky rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central rosette. The plant produces vibrant, bell-shaped flowers that are often red or orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help retain moisture, a key adaptation for its often arid habitat. Pitcairnia araneosa is appreciated for its ornamental value and is cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
