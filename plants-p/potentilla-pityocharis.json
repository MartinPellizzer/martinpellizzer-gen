    "intro": "Potentilla pityocharis, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Potentilla pityocharis is well adapted to harsh alpine conditions, thriving in poor, rocky soils at high elevations."
