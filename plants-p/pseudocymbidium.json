    "intro": "Pseudocymbidium, commonly known as the false orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to Southeast Asia and are characterized by their pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. They produce showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white, yellow, and orange. Pseudocymbidium species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they thrive in humid, tropical environments. Their unique floral structure and adaptability make them popular among orchid enthusiasts."
