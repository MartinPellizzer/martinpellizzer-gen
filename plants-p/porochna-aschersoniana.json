It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling stars. The plant has a compact, globular shape with thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to its harsh environment. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Porochna aschersoniana is a member of the Cactaceae family, known for its succulent structure and ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
