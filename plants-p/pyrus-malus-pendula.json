    "intro": "Pyrus malus pendula, commonly known as weeping apple, is a decorative cultivar of the apple tree. It is characterized by its cascading branches that hang like a weeping willow, creating a distinctive and elegant appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar to common apples. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth. This ornamental tree is often used in gardens for its visual appeal and can also serve as a fruit-bearing plant in suitable conditions."
