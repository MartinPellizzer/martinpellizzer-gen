    "intro": "Potentilla gelida f. glabrior, commonly known as the glabrous potentilla, is a frost-tolerant shrub native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs in most varieties, though this form is glabrous, meaning it lacks these hairs. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with cold climates for its ornamental value."
