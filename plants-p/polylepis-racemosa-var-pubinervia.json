    "intro": "Polylepis racemosa var. pubinervia, commonly known as the Andean waxtree, is a shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and distinctive, elongated inflorescences that bear small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically pubescent, giving the plant its varietal name \"pubinervia,\" and they are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. This species is often found in cloud forests and p\u00e1ramo ecosystems, where it plays a vital role in local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
