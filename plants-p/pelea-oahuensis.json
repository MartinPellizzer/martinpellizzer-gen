    "intro": "Pelea oahuensis, commonly known as the Oahu pelea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Oahu. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant is often found growing in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along streambanks. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Pelea oahuensis is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Hawaii."
