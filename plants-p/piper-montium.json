    "intro": "Piper montium, commonly known as the mountain pepper plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with aerial roots that allow it to ascend tree trunks and other structures. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a glossy surface. The small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in spikes and are followed by small, three-lobed berries that are edible."
