    "intro": "Puccinellia distans subsp. fontana, commonly known as Fontana's saltbush, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of coastal and desert ecosystems. Its resilience to harsh environmental conditions contributes to its ecological significance in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
