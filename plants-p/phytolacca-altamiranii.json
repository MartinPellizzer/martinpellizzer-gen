It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous due to its toxic properties."
