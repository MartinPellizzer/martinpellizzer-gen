    "intro": "Piqueria pilosa var. pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's piqueria, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. This variety is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub environments."
