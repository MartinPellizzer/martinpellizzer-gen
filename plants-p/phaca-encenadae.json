    "intro": "Phaca encenadae, commonly known as the smoky phaca, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with small, leathery leaves that have a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that emit a faint, almost incense-like aroma, giving it its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phaca encenadae is considered a species of conservation concern."
