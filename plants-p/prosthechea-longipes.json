    "intro": "Prosthechea longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender stems and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Prosthechea longipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
