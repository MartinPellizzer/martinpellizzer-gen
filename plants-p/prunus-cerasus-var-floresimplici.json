    "intro": "Prunus cerasus var. floresimplici, commonly known as the simple-flowered cherry, is a cultivar of the sweet cherry species. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often grown as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value. The flowers are typically white or pale pink and appear in clusters, though the 'simple' in its name refers to the reduced flowering structure compared to other varieties. It produces small, sweet, and juicy fruits that are edible and often used in culinary applications. This variety is well-suited for small gardens and urban landscapes due to its manageable size and aesthetic appeal."
