    "intro": "Polypogon \u00d7 littoralis var. interruptus, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a hybrid grass species native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and periodic flooding. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like clusters of bracted florets, which are usually inconspicuous. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
