It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid or rocky landscapes."
