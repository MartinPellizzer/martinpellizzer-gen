    "intro": "Pirigara insignis, commonly known as the rare mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor it in steep, nutrient-poor terrain. Due to habitat loss, Pirigara insignis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
