    "intro": "Poa pycnantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tussock-like growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and coastal areas. Poa pycnantha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
