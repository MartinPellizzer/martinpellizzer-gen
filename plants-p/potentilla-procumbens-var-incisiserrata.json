    "intro": "Potentilla procumbens var. incisiserrata, commonly known as the cut-leaf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features wiry, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated margins that are finely cut, giving the plant its common name. Small yellow flowers appear in early summer, clustered in groups of five, and are followed by bright red or orange berries. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
