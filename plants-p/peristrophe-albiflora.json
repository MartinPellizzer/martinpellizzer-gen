    "intro": "Peristrophe albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflower sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive and adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils, making it resilient to drought. Peristrophe albiflora is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
