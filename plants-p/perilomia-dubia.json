    "intro": "Perilomia dubia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the humid rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the light, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant has a short flowering period, typically during the wet season, when it produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the moist, shaded environments where it grows. Perilomia dubia is also notable for its unique seed dispersal mechanism, which relies on the movement of small mammals in its native habitat."
