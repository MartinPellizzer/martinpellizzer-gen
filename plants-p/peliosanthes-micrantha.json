    "intro": "Peliosanthes micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Cycadaceae. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are either male or female, and it relies on specific insect pollinators for reproduction. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Peliosanthes micrantha is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes."
