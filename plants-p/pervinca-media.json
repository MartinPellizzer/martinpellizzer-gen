    "intro": "Pervinca media, commonly known as the lesser periwinkle, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to Europe. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of blue, violet, and white, which bloom in spring. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded conditions and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Pervinca media is often used in ground cover or as a border plant in gardens due to its dense growth habit."
