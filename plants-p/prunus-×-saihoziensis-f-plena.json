    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 saihoziensis f. plena, commonly known as the double-flowered cherry, is a cultivar of the Prunus genus, characterized by its densely packed, double flowers that give it a more ornamental appearance compared to single-flowered varieties. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to Japan, where it has been cultivated for its aesthetic value. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with dark green, oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which bloom in early spring, are pink to reddish in color and provide a striking visual display."
