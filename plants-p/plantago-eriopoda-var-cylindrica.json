It features rosettes of broad, oval leaves covered in dense, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tall, cylindrical flower spikes that bear small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Its fibrous roots and succulent leaves make it adaptable to various environmental conditions."
