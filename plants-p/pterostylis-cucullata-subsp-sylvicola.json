    "intro": "Pterostylis cucullata subsp. sylvicola, commonly known as the forest helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it forms a dense, low-growing rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, slender flowering stem that bears a single, pale green to white, helmet-shaped flower. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insect species, particularly wasps, due to their morphological and chemical mimicry. The subspecies is distinguished by its habitat preference and subtle differences in leaf and floral morphology compared to other members of the Pterostylis genus."
