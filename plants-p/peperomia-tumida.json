    "intro": "Peperomia tumida, commonly known as the swollen peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving them a unique textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the growing season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Peperomia tumida prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
