    "intro": "Pandanus tuamotensis var. typica, commonly known as the Tahitian pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Tuamotu Archipelago in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into spiky, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are fibrous and can be processed into a material similar to sisal. This species is well adapted to coastal environments and is often found growing near the shoreline."
