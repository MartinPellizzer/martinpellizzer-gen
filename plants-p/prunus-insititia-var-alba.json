    "intro": "Prunus insititia var. alba, commonly known as the white sand cherry, is a variant of the sand cherry species native to North America. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. The fruit is a small, yellowish drupe that ripens in late summer, and it is edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. This plant is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks."
