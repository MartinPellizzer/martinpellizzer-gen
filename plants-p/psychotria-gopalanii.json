It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in parts of India and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its restricted distribution and limited research, it remains a relatively lesser-known species within the Psychotria genus."
