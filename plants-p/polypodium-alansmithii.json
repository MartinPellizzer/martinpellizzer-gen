    "intro": "Polypodium alansmithii, commonly known as the Alansmith's holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 10 inches in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry roots that help anchor it to rocky or shaded habitats. Its spore-bearing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
