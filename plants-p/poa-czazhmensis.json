    "intro": "Poa czazhmensis, commonly known as the Tibetan bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-blue foliage, which reflects its adaptation to cold and arid environments. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, with small, wind-dispersed seeds. Poa czazhmensis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme conditions."
