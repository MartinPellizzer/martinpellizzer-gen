    "intro": "Pomatocalpa marsupiale, commonly known as the pouch orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a pouch-like lip that serves as a nectar reservoir. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals. Pomatocalpa marsupiale plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
