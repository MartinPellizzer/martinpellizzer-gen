    "intro": "Panicum trichogonum, commonly known as the slender panic grass, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces wind-pollinated flowers. Panicum trichogonum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support native wildlife."
