    "intro": "Pistia aegyptiaca, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has broad, waxy, dark green leaves that are arranged in rosettes on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and can form dense mats on the water. Pistia aegyptiaca is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants."
