    "intro": "Potentilla acutifida, commonly known as the sharp-leaved cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant features serrated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Potentilla acutifida is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
