    "intro": "Pterostylis hamiltonii, commonly known as Hamilton's hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It features a slender, leafless stem with a single, showy greenish-yellow flower that resembles a hood. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as understorey vegetation in forests. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly thynnine wasps, which are attracted to the nectar-producing structures. The orchid is valued for its unique morphology and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental appeal."
