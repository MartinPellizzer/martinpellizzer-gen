    "intro": "Poa skvortzovii, commonly known as Skvortzov's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue-green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish tint, and it is adapted to cold and arid conditions. Poa skvortzovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
