    "intro": "Photinia lancilimba var. petaloconstricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved photinia, is a shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often a glossy green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it suitable for hedges or specimen planting."
