    "intro": "Pilosella mandonii var. soratae, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared chamoebryum, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant is distinguished by its dense, woolly foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
