    "intro": "Peristethium roraimense, commonly known as the Roraima liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which consists of a flat, leaf-like body that grows close to the ground. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and humid forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including archegonia and antheridia, are located on the upper surface of the thallus. Peristethium roraimense is notable for its limited distribution, primarily occurring in the tepuis of South America."
