    "intro": "Prunus violacea, commonly known as the violet cherry or violacea cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to purple, which appear in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that ripens to a dark purple or black color. Prunus violacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
