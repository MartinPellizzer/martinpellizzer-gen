    "intro": "Pteris plumeria, commonly known as the sacred fern or water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often divided into small, overlapping segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Pteris plumeria is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its cultural and medicinal significance in various regions."
