    "intro": "Pleione parishii, commonly known as the Yunnan pleione, is a rare and beautiful orchid native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers with yellow markings, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in shaded forest environments, and has fleshy, pseudobulb-like stems that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and it is known for its ornamental value in horticulture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
