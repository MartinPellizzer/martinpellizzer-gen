    "intro": "Pandanus takaroaensis, commonly known as the Tahitian pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the island of Tahiti in French Polynesia. It is a member of the Pandanus genus, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves and distinctive, spiky inflorescences. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it withstand salt spray and wind. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has cultural significance in Polynesian traditions."
