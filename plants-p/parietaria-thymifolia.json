    "intro": "Parietaria thymifolia, commonly known as the thyme-leaved wallweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and soothing properties."
