    "intro": "Pogonia minor var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale bog orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wet, acidic habitats such as bogs and pine flatwoods. The plant features a slender, leafless stem with a single, showy flower that is usually pink or purple in color. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for nutrient uptake. The species is relatively rare and is protected in some states due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
