    "intro": "Prismatocarpus hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's pandanus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pandanaceae and is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as a flavoring agent. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically borne on long, branched stems. Its botanical structure includes a woody stem with a fibrous root system, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments. The leaves are long and strap-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its native habitat."
