    "intro": "Pteris wallichiana var. yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan water fern, is a species of fern native to China, particularly Yunnan Province. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically bright green and often have a wavy or undulating edge. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
