    "intro": "Pteris subsimplex, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, curled fronds that resemble a rosette or a crown. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give it a dense, feathery appearance. Pteris subsimplex is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
