    "intro": "Parkia, commonly known as the flame tree or kapok tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas, with several species thriving in humid climates. The plant is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling flames. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, giving the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. Parkia species are also valued for their ecological benefits, including nitrogen fixation and providing habitat for various wildlife."
