    "intro": "Pterostylis falcata, commonly known as the sickle-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, sickle-shaped leaves and a single, slender flowering stem that produces a single, greenish-yellow flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and understoreys. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insect species, often bees and wasps. The orchid's morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptations to its ecological niche."
