    "intro": "Pitcairnia sceptriformis, commonly known as the royal pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence, which can reach heights of up to 3 meters, making it one of the most visually dramatic plants in the Bromeliaceae family. The leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help collect and retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowers, which are typically pink or red, are borne in clusters at the tip of the stem and are pollinated by birds and insects. This species is also notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
