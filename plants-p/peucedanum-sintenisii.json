    "intro": "Peucedanum sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenis' angelica, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a biennial or perennial herb characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in complex umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
