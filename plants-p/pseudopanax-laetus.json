    "intro": "Pseudopanax laetus, commonly known as the lancewood, is a unique evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, spiky fruits. It is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in its native habitat."
