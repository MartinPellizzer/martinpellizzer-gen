It is characterized by its showy, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual appeal to gardens. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically opposite on the stems, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-draining soil. This variety is particularly popular in warm climates due to its heat and drought tolerance."
