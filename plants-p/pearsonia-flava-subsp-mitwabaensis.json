    "intro": "Pearsonia flava subsp. mitwabaensis, commonly known as the Mitwaba pearsonia, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within montane forests, where it thrives in cooler, humid conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a pale yellow or greenish hue, which contributes to its unique botanical appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
