    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 aleutica, commonly known as the Alaska potentilla, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with multiple stems that often spread horizontally along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to withstand cold temperatures. Potentilla \u00d7 aleutica is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
