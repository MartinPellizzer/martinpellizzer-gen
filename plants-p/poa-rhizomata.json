    "intro": "Poa rhizomata, commonly known as the tussock grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. It forms dense clumps through the development of horizontal underground stems called rhizomes. These rhizomes allow the plant to spread vegetatively, creating extensive tussocks in various habitats. The plant typically has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and habitat provision."
