It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. Its fruit is a dry, dehiscent pod that splits open to release seeds, a common reproductive strategy in the Fabaceae family. The plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
