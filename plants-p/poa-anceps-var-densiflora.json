    "intro": "Poa anceps var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered meadow grass, is a variant of the meadow grass species native to various regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. The plant typically thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
