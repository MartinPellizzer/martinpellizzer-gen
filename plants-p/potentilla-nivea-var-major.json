It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. Potentilla nivea var. major is adapted to cold, harsh climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value in alpine gardens."
