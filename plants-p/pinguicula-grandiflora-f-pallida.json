    "intro": "Pinguicula grandiflora f. pallida, commonly known as the pale-flowered butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil. Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptations make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
