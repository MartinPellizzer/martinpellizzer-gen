    "intro": "Peltogyne campestris, commonly known as the broad-leafed ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hard, dense wood and its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and pinnate. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its durable wood, it has been historically used in construction and furniture-making."
