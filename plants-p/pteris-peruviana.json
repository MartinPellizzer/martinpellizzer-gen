    "intro": "Pteris peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian water fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and marshes. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. Pteris peruviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
