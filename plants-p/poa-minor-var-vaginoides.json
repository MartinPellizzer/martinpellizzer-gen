    "intro": "Poa minor var. vaginoides, commonly known as the dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing grass species native to parts of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive sheath that clasps the stem tightly. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
