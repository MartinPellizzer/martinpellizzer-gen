    "intro": "Pentadesma maritima, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in salty environments. The plant is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in maritime climates."
