    "intro": "Prunus munsoniana, commonly known as the Munson cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its oval, glossy leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by edible, yellowish-red fruits that are similar to cherries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is also considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
