    "intro": "Piptandra, commonly known as the bladder nut, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Piptandra goniostyla, which is native to the Mediterranean region. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble small bladders, hence its common name. The leaves are typically alternate and palmately lobed, while the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Piptandra species are often found in dry, rocky habitats and are valued for their ornamental appeal and historical medicinal uses."
