    "intro": "Pitcairnia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are often variegated, displaying a mix of green and silver hues, adding to its ornamental value. Pitcairnia heterophylla thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
