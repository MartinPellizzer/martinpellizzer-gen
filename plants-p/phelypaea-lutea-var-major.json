    "intro": "Phelypaea lutea var. major, commonly known as the yellow water fern, is a variant of the water fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a floating aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright yellow to golden in color. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of its fronds. This species is valued in aquariums and as a decorative element in water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability."
