    "intro": "Peiranisia robiniifolia, commonly known as the Robiniifolia tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release winged seeds. Peiranisia robiniifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a shade tree in tropical landscapes."
