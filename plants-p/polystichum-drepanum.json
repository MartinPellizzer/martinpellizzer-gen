    "intro": "Polystichum drepanum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically arranged in a dense, upright clump. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Polystichum drepanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
