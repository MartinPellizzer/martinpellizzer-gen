    "intro": "Potentilla sylvestris subvar. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features wiry stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne in compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
