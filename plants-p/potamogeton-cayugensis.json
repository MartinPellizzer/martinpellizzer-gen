    "intro": "Potamogeton cayugensis, commonly known as Cayuga pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of North America, particularly in the Cayuga Lake region. It has long, slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by cylindrical fruits containing single seeds. It plays an important role in aquatic habitats by providing shelter for fish and invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
