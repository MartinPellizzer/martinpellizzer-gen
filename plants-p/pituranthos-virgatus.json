    "intro": "Pituranthos virgatus, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, which makes it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, which are typically arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping in arid regions."
