It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy areas, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. It has small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
