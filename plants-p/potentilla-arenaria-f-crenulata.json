    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria f. crenulata, commonly known as the sandstone cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The leaves are usually narrow and slightly lobed, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is a subspecies of Potentilla arenaria, distinguished by its crenulate leaf margins. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry slopes."
