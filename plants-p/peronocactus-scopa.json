It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stem and dense, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
