    "intro": "Panicum paianum var. minus, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a compact, low-growing grass species native to certain regions of Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in poor soils and full sun. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated as a drought-tolerant ground cover."
