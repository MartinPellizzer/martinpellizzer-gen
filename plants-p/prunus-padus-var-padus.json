    "intro": "Prunus padus var. padus, commonly known as the white-flowered bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red, drupes that persist into winter. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in hedgerows and as a food source for wildlife."
