    "intro": "Pauridiantha paucinervis subsp. lyallii, commonly known as the Lyall's pauridiantha, is a rare and endemic species native to New Zealand. It is a shrub characterized by its small, narrow leaves with a distinct venation pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
