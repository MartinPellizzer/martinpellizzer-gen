It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade, often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a hairy texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers in early spring.
