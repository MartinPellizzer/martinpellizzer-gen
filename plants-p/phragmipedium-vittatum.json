    "intro": "Phragmipedium vittatum, commonly known as the golden phragmipedium, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers with purple markings, which bloom on erect, leafy stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture to help retain moisture. The orchid prefers high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
