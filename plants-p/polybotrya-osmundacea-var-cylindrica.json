    "intro": "Polybotrya osmundacea var. cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical water fern, is a rare aquatic fern found in specific freshwater habitats. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, thread-like fronds that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters with soft, acidic substrates. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, cylindrical clusters along the fronds. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
