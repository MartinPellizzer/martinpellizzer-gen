    "intro": "Pouteria baranensis, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon basin. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, spiny capsules containing edible seeds. These seeds, known as Brazil nuts, are enclosed in a hard, fibrous shell and are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity within its native habitat."
