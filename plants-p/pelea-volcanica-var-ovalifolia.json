    "intro": "Pelea volcanica var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the volcanic pelea, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific volcanic regions. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, volcanic soils and requires high levels of sunlight. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in shades of yellow or green. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
