    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 collina var. vockie, commonly known as the Vockie cinquefoil, is a compact, flowering shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring a dense, bushy habit with multiple stems. The plant produces showy, golden-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne in clusters of five, giving it its common name. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a versatile choice for alpine gardens."
