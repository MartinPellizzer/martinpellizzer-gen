    "intro": "Pyrus communis var. domestica, commonly known as the common pear, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that appear in spring. The tree produces pomes, or true pears, which are typically harvested in late summer or early autumn. The fruit has a crisp, juicy texture and a sweet to tart flavor, depending on the variety. It is widely cultivated for its edible fruit and has been selectively bred for various horticultural traits over centuries."
