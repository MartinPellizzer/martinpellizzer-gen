    "intro": "Prunus jamasakura f. divergens, commonly known as the Japanese cherry blossom variant with divergent petals, is a botanical variant of the Prunus jamasakura species. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring petals that spread outward in a more pronounced and divergent manner compared to the typical form. This variation is primarily observed in the arrangement and extension of the petal lobes, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to Japan, where it is appreciated for its ornamental value. Its botanical study provides insights into floral evolution and genetic diversity within the Prunus genus."
