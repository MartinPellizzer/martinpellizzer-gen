    "intro": "Polypodium lapathifolium f. crispum, commonly known as the crinkled fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds with a crinkled or curled appearance. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are usually elongated and have a leathery texture, with a serrated or lobed margin. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
