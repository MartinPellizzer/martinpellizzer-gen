    "intro": "Peperomia broadwayi, commonly known as the Broadway Peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically green with a glossy texture, often displaying variegation or reddish hues along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or red, emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia broadwayi is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its drought tolerance and minimal care requirements."
