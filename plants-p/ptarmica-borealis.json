    "intro": "Ptarmica borealis, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Ptarmica borealis has a compact growth form, typically reaching only a few centimeters in height. Its ability to survive in extreme cold and low light conditions makes it an important component of polar ecosystems."
