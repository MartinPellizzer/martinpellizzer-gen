    "intro": "Piptostegia operculata, commonly known as the hooded milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, hood-like bracts that enclose its small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Piptostegia operculata is often found in rocky soils and is an important plant in desert ecosystems."
