    "intro": "Pentas longituba var. magnifica, commonly known as the magnifica pentas, is a striking flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, tubular flowers that are typically bright red or orange, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has a shrub-like growth habit with multiple stems and lance-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its vibrant blooms and is often used in ornamental gardening."
