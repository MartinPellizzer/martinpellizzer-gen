    "intro": "Pericalia pudica, commonly known as the shy plant, is a unique species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, pale flowers that open only in response to touch, a trait known as thigmonastic behavior. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's name reflects its reclusive nature, as it tends to curl its leaves when disturbed. Botanically, it is notable for its specialized structures that aid in moisture retention and protection from herbivores."
