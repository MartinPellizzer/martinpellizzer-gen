    "intro": "Pilosella pieriana, commonly known as the alpine pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine meadows. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Pilosella pieriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
