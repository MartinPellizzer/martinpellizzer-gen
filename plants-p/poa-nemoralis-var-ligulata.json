    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form of Poa nemoralis. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
