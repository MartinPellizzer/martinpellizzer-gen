It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Its stinging hairs, like those of other nettles, can cause skin irritation upon contact."
