It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the spring. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
