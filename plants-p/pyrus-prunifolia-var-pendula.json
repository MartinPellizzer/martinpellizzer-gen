    "intro": "Pyrus prunifolia var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping whitebeam, is a striking ornamental tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its cascading branches that create a distinctive, drooping appearance, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. The tree produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, yellowish fruits that are often used in jams and jellies. Its leaves are oval-shaped, dark green, and turn a vibrant red or orange in the autumn. This variety is relatively hardy and adaptable, thriving in a range of soil types and light conditions."
