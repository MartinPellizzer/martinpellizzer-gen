    "intro": "Poa trivialis var. scabra, commonly known as rough meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rough, hairy texture on the leaf blades and stems, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Poa trivialis. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as lawns, roadsides, and meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a basal rosette structure that helps it survive in cooler climates. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that mature into seeds, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas."
