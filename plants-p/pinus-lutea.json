    "intro": "Pinus lutea, commonly known as the yellow pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are typically yellow-green in color and occur in bundles of two. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against fire and drought. Pinus lutea is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to warm, temperate climates."
