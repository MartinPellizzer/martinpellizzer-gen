    "intro": "Paspalum scutatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, often forming dense, low-growing turf. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Paspalum scutatum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
