    "intro": "Pyrus poteriifolia, commonly known as the Japanese whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often lobed and have a distinctive, almost maple-like appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, edible fruits that are typically pear-shaped. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and winter interest, making it a popular choice in horticulture."
