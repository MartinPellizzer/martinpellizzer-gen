    "intro": "Psychotria cauliflora, commonly known as the Christmas or holiday psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its cauliflorous flowering habit, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the trunk and branches. Its small, white or pink flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are typically red or yellow when ripe. Psychotria cauliflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and seasonal blooming."
