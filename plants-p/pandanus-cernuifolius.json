    "intro": "Pandanus cernuifolius, commonly known as the drooping pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow, drooping leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that eventually develop into fibrous, spiky fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. The species is adapted to coastal and wetland environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant in tropical climates."
