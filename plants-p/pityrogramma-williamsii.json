    "intro": "Pityrogramma williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pityrogrammaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
