    "intro": "Prestinaria bidentoides, commonly known as the two-toothed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
