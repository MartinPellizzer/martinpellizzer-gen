    "intro": "Polypodium rectangulare, commonly known as the rectangular holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often leathery fronds with a rectangular shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
