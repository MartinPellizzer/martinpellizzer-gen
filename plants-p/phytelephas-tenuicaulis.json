    "intro": "Phytelephas tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed sago palm, is a species native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil and Peru. It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spadices, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its botanical features make it a notable ornamental plant, though it is less commonly cultivated than other sago palms."
