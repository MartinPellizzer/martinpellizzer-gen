    "intro": "Portlandia grandiflora var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features fleshy, upright stems covered in thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience."
