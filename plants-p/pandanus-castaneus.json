    "intro": "Pandanus castaneus, commonly known as the coconut pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that form a rosette at the top. The plant produces inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Its fibrous leaves are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The fruit, which resembles a coconut, contains a single seed and is edible when ripe."
