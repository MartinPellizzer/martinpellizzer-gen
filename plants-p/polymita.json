It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain numerous tiny seeds. Polymita is often found in moist, disturbed habitats and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
