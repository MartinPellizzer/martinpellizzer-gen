    "intro": "Pinus mughus var. typica, commonly known as the Himalayan blue pine, is a variant of the blue pine species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and blue-green needles that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long. The tree produces cones that are often reddish-brown and contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cold, dry climates and is adapted to high-altitude environments with poor soil conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in reforestation efforts in its native range."
