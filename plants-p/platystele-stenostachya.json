    "intro": "Platystele stenostachya, commonly known as the narrow-staminal platystele, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant has a short, underground rhizome and produces a single, slender stem that bears a few flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, often growing on tree roots or in mossy substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platystele stenostachya is considered a rare and endangered species."
