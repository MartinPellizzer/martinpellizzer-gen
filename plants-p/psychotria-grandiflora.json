    "intro": "Psychotria grandiflora, commonly known as the \"Coca plant\" or \"Cocaine plant,\" is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly the Andean regions of Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. It contains alkaloids, including cocaine, which are found primarily in its leaves. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is both a subject of scientific study and a plant with significant legal and cultural implications."
