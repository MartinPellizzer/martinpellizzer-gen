    "intro": "Pseudozygocactus epiphylloides subsp. bradei, commonly known as the Brade's false jointcactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a covering of short, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
