    "intro": "Prinos integerrimus, commonly known as the rough prion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for survival in well-drained soils. Prinos integerrimus is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in full sun."
