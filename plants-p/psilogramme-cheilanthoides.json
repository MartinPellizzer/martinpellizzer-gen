    "intro": "Psilogramme cheilanthoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Psilogramme cheilanthoides is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
