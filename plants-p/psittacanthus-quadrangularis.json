    "intro": "Psittacanthus quadrangularis, commonly known as the diamond leaf or quadrangular fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, diamond-shaped fronds. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats on the forest floor. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. Psittacanthus quadrangularis is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued as an ornamental plant in horticulture."
