It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous tiny seeds. Pycreus testui is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks."
