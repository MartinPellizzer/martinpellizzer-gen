It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
