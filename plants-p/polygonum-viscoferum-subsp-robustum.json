    "intro": "Polygonum viscoferum subsp. robustum, commonly known as the robust knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from greenish-white to reddish-purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and roadside areas. Due to its rapid growth and spreading habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
