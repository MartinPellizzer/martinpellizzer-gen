    "intro": "Psammisia debilis var. ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils, often found in dry or semi-arid environments. Its small, white flowers are typically clustered in umbrella-like shapes, and it produces small, round fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
