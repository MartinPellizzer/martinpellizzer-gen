    "intro": "Phalangium esculentum, commonly known as the edible centipede, is a species of centipede that is occasionally consumed in certain cultures. It belongs to the order Scolopendridae and is characterized by its long, segmented body and numerous pairs of legs. The plant-like appearance of its body can sometimes lead to confusion with certain arthropods. While not a true plant, it is sometimes referred to in botanical discussions due to its habitat in moist, plant-rich environments. Its role in the ecosystem is primarily as a predator of small invertebrates."
