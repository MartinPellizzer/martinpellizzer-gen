    "intro": "Phyllanthus sandwicensis var. degeneri, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandwicensis phyllanthus, is a rare plant endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and is adapted to the unique climate of Hawaii. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
