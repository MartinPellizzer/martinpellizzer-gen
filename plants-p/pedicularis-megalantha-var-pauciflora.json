    "intro": "Pedicularis megalantha var. pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its parasitic growth habit. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, often on the roots of other plants. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, with a distinctive spurred structure. Its leaves are often reduced to small scales, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on haustoria to absorb nutrients from host plants. This variant is noted for its limited floral display, with only a few flowers per inflorescence."
