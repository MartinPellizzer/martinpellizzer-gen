    "intro": "Platanthera yadongensis, commonly known as the Yadong orchid, is a rare and endangered species of orchid native to China. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and wetlands. It has a short-lived rhizome and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is critically threatened in the wild."
