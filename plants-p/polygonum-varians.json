    "intro": "[WRONG START] Polygonum variang, commonly known as the variable knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Polygonum varians is known for its ability to thrive in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along stream banks and in wetlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a common weed and a plant of ecological interest."
