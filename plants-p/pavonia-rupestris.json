    "intro": "Pavonia rupestris, commonly known as the rock pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to red, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant flowers. Pavonia rupestris is valued in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
