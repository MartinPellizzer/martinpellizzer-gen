    "intro": "Plectranthus longicornis, commonly known as the horned mint, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, square stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its aromatic foliage and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as both a garden plant and a source of essential oils."
