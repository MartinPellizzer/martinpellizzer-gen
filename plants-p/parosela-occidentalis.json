    "intro": "Parosela occidentalis, commonly known as the western parosela, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often at high elevations. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its fruit is a small, dry schizocarp that splits into two parts upon maturity. Parosela occidentalis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
