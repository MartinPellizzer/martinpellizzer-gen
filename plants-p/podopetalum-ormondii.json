    "intro": "Podopetalum ormondii, commonly known as the Ormond's podopetalum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, shrub-like structure with evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are leathery and glossy, adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
