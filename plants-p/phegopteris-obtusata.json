    "intro": "Phegopteris obtusata, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, broad, and rounded shape. The fronds are usually unlobed but may have small, tooth-like projections along the margins."
