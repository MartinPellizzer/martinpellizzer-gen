    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris subsp. renati, commonly known as the Renati's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and often threatened species in many regions."
