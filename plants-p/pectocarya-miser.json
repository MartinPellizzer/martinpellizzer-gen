    "intro": "Pectocarya miser, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pectocarya miser is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
