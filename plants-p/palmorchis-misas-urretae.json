    "intro": "Palmorchis misas-urretae, commonly known as the Misas-Urreta's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence and striking, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its delicate flowers are typically pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
