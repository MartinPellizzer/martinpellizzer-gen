    "intro": "Platystele hyalina, commonly known as the glassy platystele, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its short, compact rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is notable for its lack of visible stems and its ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platystele hyalina is considered a rare and endangered species."
