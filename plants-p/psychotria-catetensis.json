    "intro": "Psychotria catetensis, commonly known as the \"Coffeetree\" or \"Coffeewood,\" is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee plants, and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of lowland and montane forests, and its wood is valued for its strength and resistance to decay. Psychotria catetensis plays a significant role in local ecosystems and has cultural importance in some indigenous communities."
