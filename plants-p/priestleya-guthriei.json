    "intro": "Priestleya guthriei, commonly known as the Guthrie's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale green to white flowers, which resemble ghostly apparitions, and its unique, elongated leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in the understory of forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
