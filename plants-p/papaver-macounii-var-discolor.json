    "intro": "Papaver macounii var. discolor, commonly known as the Macoun's poppy, is a variant of the Macoun's poppy, a species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking, papery, disc-shaped petals that display a unique coloration, often with a contrasting central area. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, thriving in alpine environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
