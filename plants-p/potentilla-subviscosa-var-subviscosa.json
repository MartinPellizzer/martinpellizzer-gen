    "intro": "Potentilla subviscosa var. subviscosa, commonly known as sticky cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, and its leaves are typically palmately divided into five lobes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other damp habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
