    "intro": "Phyllocarpus, commonly known as the \"false holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. They are characterized by their small, often spiny leaves and showy, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange. The fruits are fleshy and berry-like, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. Phyllocarpus species are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their attractive foliage and unique appearance."
