    "intro": "Polypodium auriculatum var. subglabrum, commonly known as the smooth-leafed shield fern, is a variant of the auriculatum species within the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its leathery, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clustered, shield-shaped pinnae that give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
