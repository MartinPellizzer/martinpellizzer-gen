    "intro": "Polygonum ovatum, commonly known as the Japanese everlasting or the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to Japan and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces clusters of small, blue-violet flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its showy blooms and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
