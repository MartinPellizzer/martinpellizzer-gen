    "intro": "Prunus mume var. pleiocarpa, commonly known as the multi-fruited Chinese plum, is a variant of the Japanese apricot. It is characterized by its unique ability to produce multiple fruits on a single branch, a trait that makes it distinct from typical Prunus mume varieties. The plant is native to China and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its flowers are typically white or pink, followed by small, aromatic fruits that ripen in late spring. The botanical interest of this variety lies in its unusual fruiting pattern and potential for ornamental and culinary use."
