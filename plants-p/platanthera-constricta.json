    "intro": "Platanthera constricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and bogs in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower spike that bears a single, pale green to yellowish orchid flower. The plant relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common feature among orchids. It typically blooms in late summer and is often found in acidic, nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in many regions."
