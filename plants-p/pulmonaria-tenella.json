    "intro": "Pulmonaria tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lungwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with distinctive purple veins. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-purple flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady woodland areas and is often found in calcareous soils. Pulmonaria tenella is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators in early spring."
