    "intro": "Panicum unguinosum, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces fluffy, pinkish to reddish seed heads that resemble small clouds. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes more reddish in the fall. Panicum unguinosum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
