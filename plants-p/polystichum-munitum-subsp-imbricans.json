    "intro": "Polystichum munitum subsp. imbricans, commonly known as the western sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland habitats."
