    "intro": "Pinus baldensis, commonly known as the Bald Mountain pine, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the southern Appalachian Mountains. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The tree has long, needle-like leaves that are arranged in bundles of five, and it produces cones that are cylindrical and often covered in resin. Its growth is slow, and it plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
