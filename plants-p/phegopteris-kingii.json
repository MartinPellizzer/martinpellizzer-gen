    "intro": "Phegopteris kingii, commonly known as the King's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in photosynthesis in low-light conditions. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds and are dispersed by wind, facilitating its spread in suitable habitats."
