    "intro": "Physalis foetidissima, commonly known as the stinking lantern or the foul-smelling cape gooseberry, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated calyx that resembles a lantern. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are encased in a papery, persistent husk. The leaves are typically ovate with a rough texture, and the plant often grows in moist, shaded environments. Despite its pungent odor, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance."
