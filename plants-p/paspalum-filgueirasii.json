    "intro": "Paspalum filgueirasii, commonly known as the Filgueira paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
