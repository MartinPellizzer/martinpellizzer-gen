    "intro": "Poa glauca var. subulata, commonly known as the blue mountain grass, is a variant of the bluegrass species native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage that often displays a bluish-green hue, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in natural landscapes."
