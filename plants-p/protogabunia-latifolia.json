It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow, followed by small, spherical berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
