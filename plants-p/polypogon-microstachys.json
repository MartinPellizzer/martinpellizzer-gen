    "intro": "Polypogon microstachys, commonly known as the little bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in prairie and woodland habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically reddish-brown in color. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and soil stabilization abilities. Polypogon microstachys plays an important ecological role in supporting wildlife and maintaining soil health."
