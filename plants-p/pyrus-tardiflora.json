    "intro": "Pyrus tardiflora, commonly known as the late-flowering pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom late in the spring, typically after most other pear species. Its fruit is a small, yellowish pear that ripens in late summer and is edible but not commonly cultivated for commercial use. Pyrus tardiflora is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and inland environments."
