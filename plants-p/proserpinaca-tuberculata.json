    "intro": "Proserpinaca tuberculata, commonly known as the sea fennel, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its aromatic, feathery leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. It has a creeping growth habit with tuberous roots that help it survive in harsh, saline conditions. Proserpinaca tuberculata is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
