    "intro": "Poa freartitis, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and limited nutrient availability. Due to its ecological significance, Poa freartitis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in high-altitude ecosystems."
