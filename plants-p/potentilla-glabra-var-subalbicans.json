    "intro": "Potentilla glabra var. subalbicans, commonly known as the silverleaf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine, fuzzy hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact form and ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, requiring minimal water once established."
