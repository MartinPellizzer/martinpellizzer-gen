    "intro": "Praecereus campinensis, commonly known as the Campinense cactus, is a species native to Colombia. It is a succulent plant characterized by its cylindrical stems and spiny, segmented structure. The plant produces yellow flowers during the dry season, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-draining soil. Its unique morphology and adaptation to harsh climates make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
