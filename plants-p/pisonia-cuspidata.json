    "intro": "Pisonia cuspidata, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, red-orange bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by orange-red fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas. Pisonia cuspidata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and public spaces."
