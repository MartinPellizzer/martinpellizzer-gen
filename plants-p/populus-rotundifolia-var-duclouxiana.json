    "intro": "Populus rotundifolia var. duclouxiana, commonly known as the Ducloux's balsam poplar, is a rare and relict species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive rounded leaves, which are often covered in a dense, woolly pubescence. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, often in association with other hardwoods. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
