It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers. The plant has evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are densely clustered at the base. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or heathland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
