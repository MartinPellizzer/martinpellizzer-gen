    "intro": "Prescottia corcovadensis, commonly known as the purple pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking violet-colored leaves that form deep, pitcher-shaped structures. These pitchers secrete a sticky nectar to lure insects, which then drown in the liquid and are digested by the plant. The plant's unique morphology and specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish."
