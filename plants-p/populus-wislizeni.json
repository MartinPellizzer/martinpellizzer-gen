    "intro": "Populus wislizeni, commonly known as the wislizeni poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins during the spring, which are followed by oval, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas along rivers and streams. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
