    "intro": "Phegopteris dianae, commonly known as the Appalachian hart's-tongue fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, leathery fronds that resemble a hart's tongue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. It has a short rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
