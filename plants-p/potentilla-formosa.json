    "intro": "Potentilla formosa, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to alpine environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and elliptical, with a slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Potentilla formosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
