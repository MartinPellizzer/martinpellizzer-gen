    "intro": "Pediocactus peeblesianus subsp. peeblesianus, commonly known as the Pebblesianus cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive rib structure and spines that are typically yellow to brown in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
