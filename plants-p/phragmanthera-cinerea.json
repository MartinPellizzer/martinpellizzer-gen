    "intro": "Phragmanthera cinerea, commonly known as the silverleaf phragmanthera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its grayish-green, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
