    "intro": "Potentilla fragarioides var. ternata, commonly known as the trailing potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, arching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature."
