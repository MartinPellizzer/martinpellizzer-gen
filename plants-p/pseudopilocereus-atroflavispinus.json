It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of dark purple to black flowers that open at night. The plant has a columnar shape with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. It thrives in arid conditions and requires well-draining soil. Its nocturnal blooming habit makes it a unique and attractive addition to desert gardens."
