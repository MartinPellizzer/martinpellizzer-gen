    "intro": "Potentilla chrysantha var. latefoliolata, commonly known as the late-leaved potentilla, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, compact growth with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of golden-yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
