    "intro": "Phelipanche lavandulaceoides, commonly known as the lavender-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true roots and its ability to attach to the roots of host plants. The plant produces small, often fragrant, lavender-colored flowers, which are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and can be a nuisance in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
