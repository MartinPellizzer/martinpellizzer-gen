    "intro": "Prenanthes runcinata, commonly known as the slender false nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Prenanthes runcinata is not typically cultivated but is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
