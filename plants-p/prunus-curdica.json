    "intro": "Prunus curdica, commonly known as the Curd's cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Prunus curdica is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
