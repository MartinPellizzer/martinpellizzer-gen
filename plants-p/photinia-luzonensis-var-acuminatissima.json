    "intro": "Photinia luzonensis var. acuminatissima, commonly known as the Luzon photinia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks."
