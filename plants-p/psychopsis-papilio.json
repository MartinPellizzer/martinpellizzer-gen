    "intro": "Psychopsis papilio, commonly known as the pink psychopsis, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety pink petals and a unique, club-shaped lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early autumn, producing a fragrant scent that attracts specific pollinators. Psychopsis papilio is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
