    "intro": "Porcelia mediocris, commonly known as the common porcelain fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving it a porcelain-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while absorbing nutrients. Porcelia mediocris is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
