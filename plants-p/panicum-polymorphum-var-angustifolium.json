    "intro": "Panicum polymorphum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, which are small and often have a reddish tint. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize wetland soils."
