    "intro": "Planchonella erringtonii, commonly known as the Kauri apple, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, fleshy fruits resembling apples, which are edible but not widely consumed. Its botanical significance lies in its role within its native ecosystems and its potential for ornamental and medicinal uses."
