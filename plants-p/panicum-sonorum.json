    "intro": "Panicum sonorum, commonly known as the hummingbird grass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and delicate, fluffy panicles that produce a soft, rustling sound in the wind, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as prairies and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps it reflect sunlight. Panicum sonorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
