    "intro": "Perezia umbratalis, commonly known as the shadow orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green foliage and its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive shape that sets it apart from other orchid species. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Perezia umbratalis is considered a vulnerable species."
