    "intro": "Poa anadyrica, commonly known as the Anadyr grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in cold, moist environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. Poa anadyrica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh native environments and is adapted to withstand extreme cold and short growing seasons."
