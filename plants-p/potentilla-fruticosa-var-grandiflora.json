    "intro": "Potentilla fruticosa var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features upright, wiry stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces showy, bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are typically green and covered in a soft, fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
