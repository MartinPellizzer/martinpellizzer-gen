    "intro": "Pyrus carpatica, commonly known as the Carpathian pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Carpathian Mountains. It typically grows to a height of 2-6 meters and features dense, upright branches with a rounded crown. The leaves are dark green, glossy, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the autumn. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and adaptability."
