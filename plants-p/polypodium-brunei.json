    "intro": "Polypodium brunei, commonly known as the Borneo wall fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the rainforests of Borneo. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, humid environments. The plant has fronds that are leathery and persistent, with a distinctive, elongated shape. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polypodium brunei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
