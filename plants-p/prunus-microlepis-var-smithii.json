    "intro": "Prunus microlepis var. smithii, commonly known as the Smith's dwarf cherry, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-red berries in the summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal, it is often used in landscape design for its compact size and seasonal interest."
