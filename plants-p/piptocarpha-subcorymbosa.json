    "intro": "Piptocarpha subcorymbosa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows from 1 to 3 feet tall, with narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Its fibrous roots help it survive in poor, sandy soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. The plant's name refers to its subcorymbose inflorescence, a type of flowering arrangement where the flowers are clustered in a flat-topped or rounded shape."
