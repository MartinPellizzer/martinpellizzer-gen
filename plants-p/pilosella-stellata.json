    "intro": "Pilosella stellata, commonly known as star dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, similar to those of dandelions. Pilosella stellata is typically found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It is a perennial herb that grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves."
