    "intro": "Polypodium velutinum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, soft, and velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The plant's unique appearance and adaptability make it a notable species in its native habitat."
