    "intro": "Polypodium rhachipterygium, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The plant's ability to absorb moisture from the air makes it well adapted to its natural habitat."
