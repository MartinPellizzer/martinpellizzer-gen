    "intro": "Plantago oliganthos var. fallax, commonly known as the fallax plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. The plant features a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. Its flowering stems bear dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are wind-pollinated. This variant is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact growth compared to other Plantago species."
