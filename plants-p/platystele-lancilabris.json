    "intro": "Platystele lancilabris, commonly known as the slender-stalked ghost orchid, is a rare and unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic plant that grows on trees in the cloud forests of Central and South America. The plant lacks leaves and instead relies on its roots for nutrient absorption, with its primary photosynthetic structures being its white, fleshy stems. Its flowers are small, white, and delicate, often appearing in clusters along the stem. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Platystele lancilabris is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
