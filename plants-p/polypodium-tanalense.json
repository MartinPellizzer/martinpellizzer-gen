    "intro": "Polypodium tanalense, commonly known as the Tanal Mountain fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in montane forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Polypodium tanalense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
