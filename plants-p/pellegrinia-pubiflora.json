It features dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale pink or white. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
