    "intro": "Pennisetum kisantuense, commonly known as the Kisantu grass, is a tall, perennial grass native to Central Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and panicle-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Pennisetum kisantuense is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
