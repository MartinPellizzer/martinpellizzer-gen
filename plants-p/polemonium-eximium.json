It features upright stems with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces striking clusters of bell-shaped, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and conservation efforts."
