    "intro": "Polystichum cavernicola, commonly known as the cave shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like shape. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often found in rocky crevices or caves. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in soil or rock. Polystichum cavernicola is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
