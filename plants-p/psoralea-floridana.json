    "intro": "Psoralea floridana, commonly known as the Florida psoralea, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy, well-drained soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as pine flatwoods and scrublands. Its small, trifoliate leaves and distinctive yellowish-white blooms contribute to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
