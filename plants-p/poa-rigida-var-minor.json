    "intro": "Poa rigida var. minor, commonly known as the hardstem bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, blue-green blades that are often used in turfgrass applications. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers. Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in ornamental landscapes."
