    "intro": "Pteris jungneri, commonly known as the Jungner's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to moist soil or rock surfaces. Pteris jungneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
