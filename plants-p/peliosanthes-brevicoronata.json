    "intro": "Peliosanthes brevicoronata, commonly known as the narrow-capped cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, pinnate leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are borne on separate male and female plants. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
