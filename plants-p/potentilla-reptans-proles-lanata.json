    "intro": "Potentilla reptans proles lanata, commonly known as the woolly cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. The woolly texture of its leaves is due to dense, soft hairs that provide some protection against herbivores and excessive sunlight."
