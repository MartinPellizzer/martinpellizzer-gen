    "intro": "Polystichum sanchezii, commonly known as the Sanche's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, lance-shaped pinnae that give it a lush, fern-like appearance. Polystichum sanchezii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
