    "intro": "Pleurothallis grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, often epiphytic growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
