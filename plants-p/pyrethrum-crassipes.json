    "intro": "Pyrethrum crassipes, commonly known as the broadleaf pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called phylloclades, which are modified leaves that help reduce water loss. Its roots contain natural insecticides called pyrethrins, making it valuable in organic pest control. Pyrethrum crassipes is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
