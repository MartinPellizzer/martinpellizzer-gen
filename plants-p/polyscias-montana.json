    "intro": "Polyscias montana, commonly known as the mountain polyscias, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments and is often found in moist, tropical forests. Polyscias montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
