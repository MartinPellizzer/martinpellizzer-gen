    "intro": "Pedicularis pantlingii subsp. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited lousewort, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, deriving some of its nutrients from host plants. It is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. It produces showy, reddish-orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact fruiting structures compared to other members of the species."
