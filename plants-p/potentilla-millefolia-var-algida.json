    "intro": "Potentilla millefolia var. algida, commonly known as alpine potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and tundra habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
