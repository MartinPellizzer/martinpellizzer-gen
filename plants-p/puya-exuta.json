    "intro": "Puya exuta, commonly known as the Andean torchflower, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the bromeliad family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant features long, narrow, evergreen leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, water-holding structure at the base. Its flowers, which are typically red or orange, bloom in late summer and are adapted to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. Puya exuta is known for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions, thriving in cool, dry climates with high solar exposure."
