    "intro": "Pteris hastifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, glossy, lance-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new fronds along their length. Pteris hastifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
