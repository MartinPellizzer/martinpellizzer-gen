    "intro": "Prosaptia multicaudata, commonly known as the multi-tailed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features a robust rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
