    "intro": "Pycnanthemum nudum, commonly known as narrowleaf mountain mint, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and dense clusters of white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist to wet soils in partial shade to full sun, often found in meadows and along stream banks. Pycnanthemum nudum is valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in herbal teas."
