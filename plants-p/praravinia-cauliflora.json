    "intro": "Praravinia cauliflora, commonly known as the flowering plant of the family Malvaceae, is a tropical species characterized by its unique cauliflorous flowering pattern, where flowers develop directly on the stems rather than the branches. It is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, pink to white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have a soft, velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
