    "intro": "Pleurostachys panicoides, commonly known as the panicle grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and panicle-like inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-bearing flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its leaves are linear and often have a rough texture, while its roots form dense networks that help stabilize soil. Pleurostachys panicoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
