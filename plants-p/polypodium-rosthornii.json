    "intro": "Polypodium rosthornii, commonly known as the rosthorn's holly fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, and its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly coating. It produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the dry season. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
