    "intro": "Parathelypteris beddomei, commonly known as the Beddome's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread across the forest floor. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
