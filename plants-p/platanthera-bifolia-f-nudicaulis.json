    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia f. nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stem lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species characterized by its unique botanical features. It possesses a slender, leafless stem that rises directly from the rhizome, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces a dense, dark green to brownish inflorescence with small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a loose raceme. It typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and bogs. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
