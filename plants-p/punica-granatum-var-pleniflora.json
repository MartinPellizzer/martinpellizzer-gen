    "intro": "Punica granatum var. pleniflora, commonly known as the double-flowered pomegranate, is a cultivar of the pomegranate tree characterized by its abundant, showy, double flowers. It is native to the Middle East and Southwestern Asia, similar to the common pomegranate, but it is primarily grown for ornamental purposes rather than fruit production. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in spring, often preceding the development of the fruit. While it can bear edible pomegranates, its main appeal lies in its striking floral display, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
