    "intro": "Platanthera manubriata, commonly known as the manubriate orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with red markings. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic habitats such as bogs and swamps, where it thrives in partial shade. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern in many regions."
