    "intro": "Pilocereus deficiens, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems that branch out into clusters. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering make it a striking addition to desert gardens."
