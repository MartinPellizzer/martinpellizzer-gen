    "intro": "Petrocosmea wardii, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific alpine and rocky habitats. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of purple and white, adapted to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and limited nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Petrocosmea wardii is considered a vulnerable species."
