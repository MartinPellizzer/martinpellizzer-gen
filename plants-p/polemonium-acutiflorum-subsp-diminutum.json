    "intro": "Polemonium acutiflorum subsp. diminutum, commonly known as the dwarf Jacob's ladder, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, wiry stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
