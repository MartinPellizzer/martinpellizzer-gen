    "intro": "Passerina esterhuyseniae, commonly known as the Esterhuysenia grass, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or pale yellow in color. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and savanna ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
