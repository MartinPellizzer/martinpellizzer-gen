    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare var. semilacerum, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. This variety is often distinguished by its shorter, more slender fronds compared to other polypodium species."
