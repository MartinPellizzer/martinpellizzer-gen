    "intro": "Phaseolus vulgaris var. willmotianus, commonly known as the Wiltmotian bean, is a lesser-known variant of the common bean. It is characterized by its unique pod and seed morphology, which differ from the standard Phaseolus vulgaris. This variety is native to Central America and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with climbing vines, producing small, green pods that mature to a variety of colors. Its botanical features make it of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying genetic diversity within the Phaseolus genus."
