    "intro": "Pitcairnia decidua, commonly known as the deciduous pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that can range from red to orange, often resembling a torch. The plant is notable for shedding its leaves seasonally, a rare trait among bromeliads, which allows it to conserve resources during dry periods. Its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves collects water, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
