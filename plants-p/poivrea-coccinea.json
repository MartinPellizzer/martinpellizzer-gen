    "intro": "Poivrea coccinea, commonly known as the red-flowered winter cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, providing early nectar for pollinators. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy, and its stems are covered in fine, reddish hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in cooler climates. Poivrea coccinea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract wildlife."
