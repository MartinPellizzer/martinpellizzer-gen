    "intro": "Phoebe triplinervis, commonly known as the three-veined phoebe, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its simple, alternate, and often elliptical leaves. The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with three prominent veins running from the base. It produces small, fragrant flowers followed by elliptical, dark blue-black berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
