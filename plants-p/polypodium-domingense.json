    "intro": "Polypodium domingense, commonly known as the Dominican shield fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Polypodium domingense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its attractive foliage."
