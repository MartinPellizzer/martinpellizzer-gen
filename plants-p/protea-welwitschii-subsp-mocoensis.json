It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous white to pinkish flowers, which are clustered around a central woody axis. The plant typically grows in coastal fynbos vegetation, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems.
