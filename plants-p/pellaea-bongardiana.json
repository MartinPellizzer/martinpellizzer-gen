    "intro": "Pellaea bongardiana, commonly known as the Bongard's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and horizontal, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Pellaea bongardiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
