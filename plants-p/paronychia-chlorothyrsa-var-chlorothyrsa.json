    "intro": "Paronychia chlorothyrsa var. chlorothyrsa, commonly known as the greenleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects in sandy and rocky habitats."
