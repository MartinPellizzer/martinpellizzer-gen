It produces vibrant orange to reddish-orange flowers with a distinctive, saucer-shaped corona. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are hairy and adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to alpine meadows."
