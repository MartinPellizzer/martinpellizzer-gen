    "intro": "Pitcairnia samuelssonii, commonly known as the Samuelsson's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which is used by various organisms in its ecosystem. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
