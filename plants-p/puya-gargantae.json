    "intro": "Puya gargantae, commonly known as the giant torch cactus, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its massive, spiny stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, making it one of the tallest cacti in the world. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom briefly during the dry season. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in arid conditions. Puya gargantae plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various desert animals."
