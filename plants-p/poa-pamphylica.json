    "intro": "Poa pamphylica, commonly known as the Pamphylian grass, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its hardy nature, Poa pamphylica is often found in naturalized areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
