    "intro": "Pteris milneana, commonly known as the Milne's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Pteris milneana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
