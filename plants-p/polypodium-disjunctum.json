    "intro": "Polypodium disjunctum, commonly known as the scattered cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often growing on cliffs or in shaded, moist environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. Polypodium disjunctum is often found in association with other epiphytic and lithophytic plants in its natural habitat."
