    "intro": "Pipturus integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf holly or red holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically broad and entire, with a striking red or orange hue on the underside. It produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Pipturus integrifolia is often found in shaded, forested areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance."
