    "intro": "Phoradendron macrophyllum var. circulare, commonly known as the circular-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has smooth, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged in a circular pattern around the stem, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. This species plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and insects while also affecting the growth of its host trees."
