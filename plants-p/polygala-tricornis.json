    "intro": "Polygala tricornis, commonly known as the three-angled milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Polygala tricornis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
