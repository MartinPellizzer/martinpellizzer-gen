    "intro": "Pterozonium terrestre, commonly known as the ground fern, is a species of fern found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread across the forest floor. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, finger-like segments that give it a lacy appearance. Pterozonium terrestre plays an important role in maintaining soil moisture and providing habitat for small organisms."
