    "intro": "Pterostylis \u00d7 ralphcranei, commonly known as the Ralph Crane's spider orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance with elongated, slender petals and a narrow, erect scape. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, producing striking, greenish-yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
