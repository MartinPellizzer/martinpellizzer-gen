    "intro": "Potentilla intercedens, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers in the summer. The plant has slender, wiry stems and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Potentilla intercedens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
