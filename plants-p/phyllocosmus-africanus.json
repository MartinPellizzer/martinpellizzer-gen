    "intro": "Phyllocosmus africanus, commonly known as the African leaf miner, is a species of leaf-mining fly belonging to the family Agromyzidae. It is characterized by its small size and distinctive larvae that feed on the leaves of various plants, creating visible tunnels or mines. The adult flies are typically pale yellow to brown in color, with delicate wings and a slender body. The plant host range of this species includes several species of grasses and shrubs native to Africa. Due to its role in plant damage, it is considered a potential pest in certain agricultural and ecological contexts."
