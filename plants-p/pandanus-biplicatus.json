    "intro": "Pandanus biplicatus, commonly known as the double-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often folded or rolled, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and for thatching, while its fruits are edible. Pandanus biplicatus thrives in coastal and humid environments, often found near the shoreline."
