It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has wiry, often hairy stems and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture adapted to cold climates. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient plant in harsh, high-altitude environments."
