    "intro": "Polypodium brasiliense var. meniscifolium, commonly known as the Brazilian licorice fern, is a species of polypody found in tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, creeping rhizome system and its ability to form extensive colonies on rocky or shaded forest floors. The fronds are typically lanceolate, with a serrated margin and a dark green, leathery texture. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
