    "intro": "Patagonium aegiceras, commonly known as the Patagonian sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust root system that helps stabilize sandy shorelines. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. Patagonium aegiceras plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
