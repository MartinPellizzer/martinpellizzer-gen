    "intro": "Polystichum brunneum, commonly known as the brown fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark brown, leathery fronds that are typically upright and lance-shaped. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polystichum brunneum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture for its durable, attractive foliage."
