    "intro": "Polypodium gibbsiae, commonly known as the Gibbs' sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of forests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium gibbsiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
