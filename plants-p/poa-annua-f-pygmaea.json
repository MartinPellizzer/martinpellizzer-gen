    "intro": "Poa annua f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf annual bluegrass, is a low-growing grass species characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and compact growth habit. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters, making it well-suited for lawns and ornamental settings. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with two to three flowering branches, which contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in disturbed soils or as a weed in agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and ability to establish dense mats make it both a desirable and problematic species in various ecosystems."
