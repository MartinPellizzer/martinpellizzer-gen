It features dense clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has wiry, ascending stems with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value and ecological benefits make it a popular choice in native landscaping."
