    "intro": "Pilea buchenavii, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features rosettes of rounded, waxy leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a slight sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, followed by tiny, round fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea buchenavii is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
