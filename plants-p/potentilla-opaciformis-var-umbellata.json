    "intro": "Potentilla opaciformis var. umbellata, commonly known as the umbellate cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces elliptical, leathery leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and long-lasting blooms."
