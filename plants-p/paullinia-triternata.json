    "intro": "Paullinia triternata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often trifoliate, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. It is often found in humid, lowland areas and is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Despite its ornamental value, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
