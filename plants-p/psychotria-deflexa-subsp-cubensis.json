It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is notable for containing the psychoactive alkaloid salvinorin A, which is responsible for its hallucinogenic effects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its unique chemical composition and cultural significance, it has become a subject of both scientific research and spiritual interest."
