    "intro": "Pedicularis physocalyx, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its striking yellow-orange flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
