    "intro": "Polypodium irioides var. lobatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed polypody, is a fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive lobed shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
