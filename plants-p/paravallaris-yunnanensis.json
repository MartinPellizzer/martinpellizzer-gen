    "intro": "Paravallaris yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan paravallaris, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged in whorls around the stems. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, making it visually striking. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
