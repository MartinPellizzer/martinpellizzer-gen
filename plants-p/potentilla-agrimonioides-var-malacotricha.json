    "intro": "Potentilla agrimonioides var. malacotricha, commonly known as the Malacotricha cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically silver-white underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a valuable addition to shaded garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and long blooming period."
