    "intro": "Panicum aciculare var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It features slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, beige to brown flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it a useful plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
