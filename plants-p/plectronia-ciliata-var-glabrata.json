    "intro": "Plectronia ciliata var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved plectronia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and glabrous. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
