It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, contributing to its ornamental value in native gardens."
