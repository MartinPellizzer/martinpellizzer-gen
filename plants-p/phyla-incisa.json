    "intro": "Phyla incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf phyla, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Phyla incisa is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
