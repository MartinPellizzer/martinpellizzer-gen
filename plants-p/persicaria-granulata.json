    "intro": "Persicaria granulata, commonly known as the rough knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are often covered in small, glandular dots, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, contributing to its common name. Persicaria granulata is often found in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows."
