    "intro": "Phragmotheca ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian phragmotheca, is a rare and little-studied plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels. Its leaves are pinnately divided, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
