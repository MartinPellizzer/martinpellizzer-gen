    "intro": "Patagonium parvifolium var. axillare, commonly known as the Patagonian dwarf leaf plant, is a herbaceous species native to the southern Andes. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude climate of its native habitat. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
