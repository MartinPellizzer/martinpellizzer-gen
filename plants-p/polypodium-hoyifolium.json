    "intro": "Polypodium hoyifolium, commonly known as the hoyi fern, is a species of polypodiaceae native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces spores in small, clustered clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature common to many ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its epiphytic or terrestrial growth habits."
