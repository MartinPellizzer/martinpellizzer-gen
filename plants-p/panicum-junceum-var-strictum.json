    "intro": "Panicum junceum var. strictum, commonly known as stiff panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
