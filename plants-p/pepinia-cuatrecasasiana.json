    "intro": "Pepinia cuatrecasasiana, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's pepinia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to red. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in a fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
