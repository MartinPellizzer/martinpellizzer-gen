    "intro": "Pilocereus senilis, commonly known as the old man cactus, is a species of cactus native to the deserts of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly spines, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, nocturnal flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
