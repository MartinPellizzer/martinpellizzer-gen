    "intro": "Pycreus hyalinus, commonly known as the glassy pycreus, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that give it a glass-like appearance, hence its common name. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained, acidic soil. Its fronds are usually slender and arching, often reaching lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Pycreus hyalinus is considered an endangered species and is rarely found in cultivation."
