    "intro": "Podocarpus monteverdeensis, commonly known as the Monteverde podocarp, is a unique evergreen tree native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and conical shape. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, a feature typical of coniferous species. It thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, often growing at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
