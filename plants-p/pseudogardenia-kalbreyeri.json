    "intro": "Pseudogardenia kalbreyeri, commonly known as the Kalbreyer's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern resembling ghostly figures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and wetlands, often on the bark of trees or in leaf litter. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
