    "intro": "Psychotria bilabiata, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its striking, butterfly-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often glossy in appearance. Its flowers, which are usually bright red or orange, are pollinated by birds and insects, and the plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Psychotria bilabiata is also noted for its use in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant in horticulture."
