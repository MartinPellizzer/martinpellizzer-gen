    "intro": "Pseudoselago spuria, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble those of other orchid genera. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces a single, slender flower spike. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pseudoselago spuria is considered a conservation concern."
