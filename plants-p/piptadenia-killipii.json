    "intro": "Piptadenia killipii, commonly known as the Amazonian ironwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and can grow up to 30 meters tall. The tree has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a pod that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. The plant is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and plays an important role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
