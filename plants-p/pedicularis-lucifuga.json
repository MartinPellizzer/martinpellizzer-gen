    "intro": "Pedicularis lucifuga, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its delicate, orchid-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, such as flies and beetles, which are attracted by its strong, often unpleasant odor. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, Pedicularis lucifuga is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
