    "intro": "Pterotropia kaalae, commonly known as the Kaua\u02bbi ironwood, is a rare endemic tree native to the island of Kaua\u02bbi in Hawaii. It is characterized by its dense, dark-green foliage and rugged, twisted trunk, which provides habitat for various native species. The plant belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Pterotropia kaalae plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and introduced species, it is considered critically endangered."
