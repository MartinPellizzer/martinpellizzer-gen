    "intro": "Penthorum sedoides subsp. chinense, commonly known as Chinese water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the substrate. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom in early summer. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
