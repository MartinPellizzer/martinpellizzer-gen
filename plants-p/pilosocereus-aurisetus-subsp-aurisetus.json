    "intro": "Pilosocereus aurisetus subsp. aurisetus, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, thick stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and requires well-draining soil. It produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green stems. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
