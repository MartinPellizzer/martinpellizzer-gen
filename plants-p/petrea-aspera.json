    "intro": "Petrea aspera, commonly known as the rough petrea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation. Petrea aspera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
