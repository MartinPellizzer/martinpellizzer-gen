    "intro": "Pyrus malus conica, commonly known as the conical apple, is a species of apple tree characterized by its unique conical shape and dense, compact growth habit. It is native to Central Asia and is known for its small, tart fruits that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. It is relatively cold-hardy and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a versatile addition to gardens and orchards. However, it is less commonly cultivated than other apple varieties due to its limited fruit size and flavor profile."
