    "intro": "Psychotria savaiiensis, commonly known as the Savaii Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Savaii in Samoa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
