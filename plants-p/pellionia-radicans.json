    "intro": "Pellionia radicans, commonly known as creeping pellionia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing, evergreen perennial that features heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it a good ground cover. It is also valued for its ability to tolerate humid conditions and partial shade."
