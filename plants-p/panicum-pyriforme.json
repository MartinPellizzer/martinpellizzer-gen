    "intro": "Panicum pyriforme, commonly known as the diamond grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, spike-like inflorescence that resembles a diamond shape, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and thrives in moist to saturated soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Panicum pyriforme plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
