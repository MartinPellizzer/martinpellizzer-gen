    "intro": "Plantago lanceolata subsp. lanuginosa, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in meadows, and in waste areas. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties and is commonly used in traditional herbal remedies."
