    "intro": "Pteris hartiana, commonly known as the Hart's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble floating leaves. The plant typically grows in wet, shady environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often submerged, and it produces spores on the underside of its fronds. Pteris hartiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
