It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its seeds are enclosed in small, spherical pods that split open when mature to release the seeds. This species is adapted to sandy and dry soils, making it a characteristic plant of coastal and arid environments."
