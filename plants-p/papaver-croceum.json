    "intro": "Papaver croceum, commonly known as the yellow poppy, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow petals and a distinctive, slender stem. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers bloom in the spring and are often visited by pollinators like bees and butterflies. The seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution."
