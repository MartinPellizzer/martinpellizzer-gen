    "intro": "Psephellus erivanensis, commonly known as the Erivan sandwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its low, spreading growth habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Psephellus erivanensis is a member of the Montiaceae family and is adapted to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
