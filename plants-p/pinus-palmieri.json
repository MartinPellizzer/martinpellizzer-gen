    "intro": "Pinus palmieri, commonly known as the palmieri pine, is a species of conifer native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its dense, feather-like foliage. The plant produces small, pale yellow cones that mature over several years. Its leaves are needle-like, typically arranged in bundles of five, and they remain on the tree for several years before falling. Pinus palmieri is adapted to coastal and limestone soils, making it a hardy species in tropical environments."
