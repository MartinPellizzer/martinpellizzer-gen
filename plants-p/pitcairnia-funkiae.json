    "intro": "Pitcairnia funkiae, commonly known as the silver star bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The leaves are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving the plant its distinctive silvery appearance. It produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in the late summer or early autumn. This plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
