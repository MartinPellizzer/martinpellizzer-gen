    "intro": "Poa glabriflora var. albida, commonly known as the white-flowered bluegrass, is a variant of the bluegrass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale blue florets that distinguish it from other varieties. This plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It is often found in regions with cool, temperate climates and well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
