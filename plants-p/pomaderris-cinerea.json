    "intro": "Pomaderris cinerea, commonly known as silver pomaderris, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, overlapping scales on its leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. Pomaderris cinerea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native garden landscapes."
