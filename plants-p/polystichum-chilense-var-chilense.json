    "intro": "Polystichum chilense var. chilense, commonly known as the Chilean holly fern, is a perennial fern native to South America, particularly Chile. It features dark green, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into serrated segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
