    "intro": "Piper ciliatum, commonly known as the hairy pepper or ciliatum pepper, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species such as black pepper. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
