It features narrow, erect leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with distinctive two-horned bracts. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often found in coastal areas. Paspalum bicorne is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
