    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic white spruce, is a rare alpine variant of the white spruce. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are short and sharply pointed, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in cold, windy environments. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils at high altitudes. This subspecies is adapted to harsh Arctic and subarctic conditions, making it a hardy component of alpine ecosystems."
