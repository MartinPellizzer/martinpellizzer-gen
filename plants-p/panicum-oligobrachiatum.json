    "intro": "Panicum oligobrachiatum, commonly known as narrow-bracted panicgrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and disturbed areas. Its growth habit makes it a common weed in agricultural settings."
