    "intro": "Podocarpus tenuifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved podocarp, is a medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Its slow growth rate makes it a valuable ornamental and timber species in horticulture."
