    "intro": "Polystichum acrostichoides f. orbiculatum, commonly known as the round-leaf wood fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its orbicular, or circular, fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The unique shape and structure of its fronds make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in horticulture."
