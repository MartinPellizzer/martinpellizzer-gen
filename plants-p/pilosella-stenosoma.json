    "intro": "Pilosella stenosoma, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance, while its yellow flowers bloom in the summer months. Pilosella stenosoma is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
