    "intro": "Pulsatilla schneebergensis, commonly known as the Schneeberg anemone, is a rare alpine plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, usually pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and grassy habitats at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
