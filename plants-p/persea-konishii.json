    "intro": "Persea konishii, commonly known as the Okinawan avocado, is a species native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is a small evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of about 5 to 8 meters. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are usually clustered in the leaf axils. Its fruit is a smooth, oval-shaped berry with a thick, leathery skin that turns from green to yellow as it matures. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited commercial cultivation due to its specific climate requirements."
