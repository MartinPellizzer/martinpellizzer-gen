    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum candidum, commonly known as the white paraprasophyllum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
