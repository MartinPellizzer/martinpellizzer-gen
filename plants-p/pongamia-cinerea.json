    "intro": "Pongamia cinerea, commonly known as the silver pongam, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by distinctive pod-like fruits containing oily seeds. These seeds are rich in oil, making the plant valuable for biodiesel production. Its ability to thrive in poor soils also makes it useful for reforestation and soil stabilization efforts."
