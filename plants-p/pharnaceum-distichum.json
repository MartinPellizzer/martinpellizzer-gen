    "intro": "Pharnaceum distichum, commonly known as the two-ranked pharnaceum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae, or grass family. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves arranged in two distinct ranks, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is typically found in moist, temperate environments, often in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized grass species."
