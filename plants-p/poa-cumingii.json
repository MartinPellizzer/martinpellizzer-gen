It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and the production of compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, temperate climates. Its leaves are often a deep blue-green color, which contributes to its ornamental appeal. Poa cumingii is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities and ability to form dense, attractive turf."
