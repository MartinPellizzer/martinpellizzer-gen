    "intro": "Plantago alopecuroides, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes during the summer months. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, due to its tolerance for poor soil conditions. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration efforts."
