    "intro": "Polypodium comptonioides, commonly known as the Compton's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a shield-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Polypodium comptonioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
