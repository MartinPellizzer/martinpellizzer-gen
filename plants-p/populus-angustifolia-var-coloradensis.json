    "intro": "Populus angustifolia var. coloradensis, commonly known as the Colorado narrowleaf cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 inches wide. The plant produces catkins as its primary reproductive structure, with separate male and female flowers. It thrives in riparian zones, often growing near rivers and streams. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
