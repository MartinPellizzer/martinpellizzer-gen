    "intro": "Paphinia hirtzii, commonly known as the hairy paphiopedilum, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers with a distinctive lip that resembles a pouch, a feature common in orchids. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Paphinia hirtzii is often cultivated in greenhouses or botanical gardens."
