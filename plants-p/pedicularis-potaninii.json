    "intro": "Pedicularis potaninii, commonly known as the mountain lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually red or purple, with a distinctive spurred shape that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
