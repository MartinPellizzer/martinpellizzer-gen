It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves that reflect light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in cymes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments.
