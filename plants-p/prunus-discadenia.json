    "intro": "Prunus discadenia, commonly known as the Japanese white cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn, adding to its seasonal appeal. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. The fruit, a small, yellowish drupe, is edible but not commonly cultivated for consumption."
