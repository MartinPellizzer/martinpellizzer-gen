    "intro": "Prunus mahaleb proles cupaniana, commonly known as the Mahaleb cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are edible but often tart and not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and reddish-brown when young. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is also used in hybridization to improve fruit quality in other cherry varieties."
