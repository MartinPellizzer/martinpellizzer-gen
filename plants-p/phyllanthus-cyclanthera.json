    "intro": "Phyllanthus cyclanthera, commonly known as the African star apple, is a tropical plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is a small tree or shrub that typically grows up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to apples, with a yellow or green skin and a sweet, juicy pulp. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a unique fruit structure that aids in seed dispersal. Phyllanthus cyclanthera is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
