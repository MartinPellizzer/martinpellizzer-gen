    "intro": "Pyrrocoma microdonta, commonly known as the dwarf pygmy bellflower, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in rocky or coastal habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
