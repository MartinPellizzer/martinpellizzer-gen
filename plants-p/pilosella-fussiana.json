It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are hairy and spoon-shaped, while the flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense heads. Pilosella fussiana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in marginal habitats."
