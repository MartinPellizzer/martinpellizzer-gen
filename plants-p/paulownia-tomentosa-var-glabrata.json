    "intro": "Paulownia tomentosa var. glabrata, commonly known as the velvet cherry or Japanese paulownia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairless, giving it its varietal name \"glabrata.\" The tree produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are pale purple to white in color. Its rapid growth rate and lightweight wood make it popular for ornamental and timber purposes. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its aggressive spread and adaptability."
