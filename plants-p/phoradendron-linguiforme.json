    "intro": "Phoradendron linguiforme, commonly known as the trumpet leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has a distinctive, elongated, tongue-shaped leaf that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered together, followed by bright red berries that are a food source for birds. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries, allowing the plant to spread to new host trees. The botanical structure of Phoradendron linguiforme includes a root system that attaches to the host tree, enabling it to absorb water and nutrients."
