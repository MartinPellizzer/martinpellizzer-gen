    "intro": "Pleocnemia aristata, commonly known as the arrowhead fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots and roots. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest understories."
