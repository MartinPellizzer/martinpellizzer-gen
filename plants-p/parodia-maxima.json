It is a solitary, globular cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that are fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators. Its stems are covered in white, woolly spines, and it is well adapted to arid environments. It requires minimal water and full sun to thrive, making it a popular choice for desert gardens."
