    "intro": "Pleione uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower orchid, is a rare and exquisite species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, solitary flower that blooms in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a unique shape that sets it apart from other orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pleione uniflora is considered a rare and endangered plant."
