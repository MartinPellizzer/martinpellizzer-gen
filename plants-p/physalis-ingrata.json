    "intro": "Physalis ingrata, commonly known as the common husk or wild groundcherry, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, orange to red berries enclosed in a papery calyx that remains attached after ripening. These berries are edible when ripe but can be tart and acidic. Physalis ingrata thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and gardens."
