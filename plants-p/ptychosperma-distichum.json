    "intro": "Ptychosperma distichum, commonly known as the double-leaf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive two-ranked leaves, which give it its common name, and its stout, unbranched trunk. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
