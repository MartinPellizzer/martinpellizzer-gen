It is characterized by its dense, dark green, elliptical leaves that are glossy on both sides. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in autumn. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a versatile plant for garden use."
