    "intro": "Parosela nana, commonly known as the dwarf parosela, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Parosela nana thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
