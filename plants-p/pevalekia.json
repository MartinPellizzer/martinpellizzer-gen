    "intro": "Pevalekia, commonly known as the golden star lily, is a unique flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting dark center. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that grow in a rosette pattern, allowing it to efficiently capture sunlight in its dense forest habitat. Pevalekia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for botanical gardens and exotic plant collections."
