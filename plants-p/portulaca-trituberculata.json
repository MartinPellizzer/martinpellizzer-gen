    "intro": "Portulaca trituberculata, commonly known as the three-ribbed purslane, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features succulent leaves and stems, which help it retain water in dry conditions. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the morning and close by midday. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
