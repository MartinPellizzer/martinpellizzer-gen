It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that are dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and often spread widely, allowing it to establish itself in a variety of habitats. Velvetleaf is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides."
