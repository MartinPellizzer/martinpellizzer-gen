It features small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture and sometimes a reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually white or pale green. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it suitable for both tabletop displays and hanging baskets."
