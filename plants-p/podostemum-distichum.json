It is characterized by its unique morphology, with small, opposite leaves that often appear in two rows along the stem. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, typically near the edges of rivers and lakes. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Podostemum distichum plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various aquatic organisms."
