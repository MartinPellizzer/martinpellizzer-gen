It is a legume with trifoliate leaves and pods that contain several edible seeds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a space-saving alternative to standard peas. Its botanical features include a taproot system and a flowering period typically in late spring. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, contributing to soil fertility."
