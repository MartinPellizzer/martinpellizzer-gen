    "intro": "Potentilla reptans var. microphylla, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticulture."
