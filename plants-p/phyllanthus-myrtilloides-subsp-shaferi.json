It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening or for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
