    "intro": "Pellaea occidentalis, commonly known as the western rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery spores. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorocarps on the underside of its fronds. Pellaea occidentalis is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
