    "intro": "Phegopteris danesiana, commonly known as the Danesian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps stabilize the substrate and support the growth of other aquatic plants. The fronds are usually divided into small, lance-shaped segments with a feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in water gardens."
