    "intro": "Pitcairnia lherminieri, commonly known as the Lherminier's pitcairnia, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of stiff, grass-like leaves that form a central rosette, which collects water and nutrients from the environment. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with long, pendulous flower spikes that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
