    "intro": "Pycnoplinthus, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers. The leaves are typically palmate, with lobes that resemble fingers, and the stems are often hairy. Pycnoplinthus species are herbaceous or shrub-like, with some species growing as small trees. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along riverbanks."
