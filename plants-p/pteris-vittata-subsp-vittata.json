    "intro": "Pteris vittata subsp. vittata, commonly known as the brake fern, is a species of fern native to Asia and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or near water sources. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively. This fern is also known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
