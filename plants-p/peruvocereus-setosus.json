    "intro": "Peruvocereus setosus, commonly known as the spiny night bloomer, is a cactus native to the Andes Mountains of Peru. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny tubercles. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering habit, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and botanical gardens."
