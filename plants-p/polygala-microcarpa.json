    "intro": "Polygala microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces tiny, bead-like fruits that contain a single seed each. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
