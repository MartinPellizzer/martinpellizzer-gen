    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia var. pervia, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and two slender, pale green or yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common feature among orchids. Its flowers are typically pollinated by flies and beetles, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitats."
