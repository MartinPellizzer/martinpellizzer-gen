    "intro": "Pinus scopulorum, commonly known as the Apache pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically 3 to 5 inches long. The tree produces cones that are typically 2 to 4 inches in length, with scales that open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The Apache pine plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
