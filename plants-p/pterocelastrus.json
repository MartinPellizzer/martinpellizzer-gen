    "intro": "Pterocelastrus, commonly known as the Chinese sandpaper tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to Asia, particularly China and Southeast Asia. The plants are characterized by their rough, sandpaper-like bark and alternate, simple leaves. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fruits that are often woody and contain several seeds. Pterocelastrus species are sometimes used in traditional medicine and are also valued for their ornamental features."
