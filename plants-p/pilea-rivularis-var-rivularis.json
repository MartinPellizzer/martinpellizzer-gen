    "intro": "Pilea rivularis var. rivularis, commonly known as the water shield, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Asia. It has floating leaves that are heart-shaped with a waxy surface, allowing it to remain buoyant. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically submerged or just below the water surface. Its rhizomes spread across the waterbed, forming dense mats that help stabilize sediment. Pilea rivularis var. rivularis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for aquatic life."
