    "intro": "Pinus picea var. mucronata, commonly known as the dwarf white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to the high elevations of the Pacific Northwest in the United States. It is a compact, slow-growing evergreen tree with a conical shape and dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are short, stiff, and often have a whitish or bluish waxy coating, giving the tree its characteristic appearance. Its cones are small and cylindrical, typically maturing to a reddish-brown color. This variety is well adapted to harsh alpine conditions, including strong winds and poor soil, making it a resilient and hardy species."
