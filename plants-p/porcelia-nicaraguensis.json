    "intro": "Porcelia nicaraguensis, commonly known as the Nicaraguan porcelia, is a rare and endemic species native to the humid lowland forests of Nicaragua. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae, characterized by its small, clustered flowers and leathery leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near the forest floor. Its ornamental value has led to increased interest in its cultivation, though it remains challenging to propagate outside its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
