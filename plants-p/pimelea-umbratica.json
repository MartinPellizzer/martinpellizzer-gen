    "intro": "Pimelea umbratica, commonly known as the shade-loving banksia, is a shrub native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its growth habit is typically low and compact, making it well-suited for rocky or acidic soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
