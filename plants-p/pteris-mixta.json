    "intro": "Pteris mixta, commonly known as the mixed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or cascading in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Pteris mixta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
