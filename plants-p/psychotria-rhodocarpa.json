It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its striking red veins on its dark green leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance.

While it is not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique foliage and potential ecological roles."
