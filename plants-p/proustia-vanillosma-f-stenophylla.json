It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that are typically pollinated by specific bee species. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical research. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
