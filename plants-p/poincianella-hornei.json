    "intro": "Poincianella hornei, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow inflorescences that resemble flames, which appear during the dry season. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into woody pods. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Poincianella hornei is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for landscaping in arid regions."
