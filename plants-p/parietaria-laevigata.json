    "intro": "Parietaria laevigata, commonly known as smooth wallworts, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually smooth or slightly hairy, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its ability to form dense colonies, which can sometimes become invasive in certain regions. Parietaria laevigata is often found growing on walls, cliffs, or in damp soil, where it can take advantage of the microclimate provided by these surfaces."
