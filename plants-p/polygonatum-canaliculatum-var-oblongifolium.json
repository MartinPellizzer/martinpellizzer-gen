It features a rhizomatous root system and lanceolate to ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries in the autumn. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other species in the genus."
