    "intro": "Phyteuma delphinense var. ellipticifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf phyteuma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The leaves are elliptical in shape, hence the variety name, and are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This plant is valued in gardens for its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
