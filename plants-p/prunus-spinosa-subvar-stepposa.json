It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, dark blue to black berries that ripen in late summer. The leaves are typically oval with a serrated margin and a slightly hairy surface. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky soils. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and small mammals."
