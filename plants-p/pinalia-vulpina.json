    "intro": "Pinalia vulpina, commonly known as the foxberry plant, is a flowering shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible and contain a high concentration of anthocyanins. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a rough texture and a serrated margin. Pinalia vulpina is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils, where it thrives in partial shade."
