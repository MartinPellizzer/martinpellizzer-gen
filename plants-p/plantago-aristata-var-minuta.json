    "intro": "Plantago aristata var. minuta, commonly known as the small-leaved plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. This variant is distinguished from the typical Plantago aristata by its smaller leaves and more compact growth habit."
