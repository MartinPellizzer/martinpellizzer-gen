    "intro": "Pulicaria inuloides, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features silver-gray foliage with dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense, spherical heads, blooming in late spring to early summer. Pulicaria inuloides is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dune habitats."
