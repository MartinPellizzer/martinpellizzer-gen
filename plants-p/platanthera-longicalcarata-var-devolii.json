    "intro": "Platanthera longicalcarata var. devolii, commonly known as the Devol's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its distinctive inflorescence of fragrant, white to pale purple flowers arranged in a loose spiral. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils in shaded woodlands, often near streams or in swampy areas. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological specificity. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many of its native regions."
