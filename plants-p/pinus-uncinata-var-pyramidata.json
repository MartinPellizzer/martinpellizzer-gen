It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dense, pyramidal crown, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The needles are typically blue-green in color, and the cones are small and often pendulous. This variety is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
