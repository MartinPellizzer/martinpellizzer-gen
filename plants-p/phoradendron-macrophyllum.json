    "intro": "Phoradendron macrophyllum, commonly known as the trumpet vine, is a woody climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces vibrant orange to red tubular flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting hummingbirds and other pollinators. Its stems are flexible and can climb by means of twining around supports. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
