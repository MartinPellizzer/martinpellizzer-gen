    "intro": "Pinus abies subsp. vulgaris, commonly known as the European silver fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a conical crown that becomes more irregular with age. The needles are long, flat, and dark green, with two white stomatal bands on their upper surface. Its cones are typically pendulous, with reddish-brown scales that open to release seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
