    "intro": "Pleopeltis plebeia, commonly known as the common pleopeltis, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often grow in a rosette formation. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, such as forest canopies, where it attaches itself to trees or rocks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species."
