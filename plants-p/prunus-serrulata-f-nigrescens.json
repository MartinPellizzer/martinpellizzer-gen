It is characterized by its dark purple to black petals, which contrast vividly with its white or pale pink buds. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. It blooms in early spring, producing clusters of fragrant flowers that attract pollinators. Its unique coloration makes it a prized ornamental plant in botanical gardens and landscape design."
