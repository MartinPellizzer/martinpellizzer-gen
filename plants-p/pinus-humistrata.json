    "intro": "Pinus humistrata, commonly known as the lowland white pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and long, needle-like leaves that are typically two to three inches in length. The tree produces cones that are often reddish-brown in color and are borne on the lower branches. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and along river valleys. Due to its unique growth form and habitat preferences, it is an important component of the local ecosystem."
