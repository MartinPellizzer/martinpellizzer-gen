The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and forest edges. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
