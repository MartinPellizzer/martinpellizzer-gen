    "intro": "Picea rubens f. virgata, commonly known as the white spruce, is a variant of the red spruce native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white bark, which distinguishes it from the more commonly found red spruce. The foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking contrast to the pale bark. It produces cones that are usually pendulous, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and montane forest ecosystems."
