    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus caudipinnus, commonly known as the long-pinnate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are typically submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the surrounding water. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems."
