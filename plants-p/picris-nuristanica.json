    "intro": "Picris nuristanica, commonly known as the Nuristan groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disc. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in high-altitude ecosystems."
