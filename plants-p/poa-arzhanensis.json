    "intro": "Poa arzhanensis, commonly known as the Arzhan meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-gray florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a dense, fibrous structure typical of the Poaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Poa arzhanensis is considered a rare and specialized plant."
