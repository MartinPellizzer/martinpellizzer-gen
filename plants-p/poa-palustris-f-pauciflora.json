    "intro": "Poa palustris f. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered bog grass, is a variant of the common bog grass, characterized by its reduced floral display. It is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. The plant typically grows in dense clumps, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often coated in a fine layer of white wax. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, with a pale greenish hue. This form is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
