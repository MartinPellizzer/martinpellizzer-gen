    "intro": "Polygala striata, commonly known as the striped milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive, spurred shape that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. The species is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its unique appearance and hardiness."
