    "intro": "Pharus glochidiatus, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem covered in sharp, spine-like structures called glochids, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are fleshy and adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Pharus glochidiatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
