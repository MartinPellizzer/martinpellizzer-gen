    "intro": "Pedicularis kongboensis var. kongboensis, commonly known as the Kongbo lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, deriving some of its nutrients from host plants. The plant features reddish or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native environment."
