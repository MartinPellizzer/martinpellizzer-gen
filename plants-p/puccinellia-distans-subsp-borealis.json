    "intro": "Puccinellia distans subsp. borealis, commonly known as Arctic grass or northern glassworts, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in tundra and coastal environments. Its adaptations to cold climates make it an important component of Arctic plant communities."
