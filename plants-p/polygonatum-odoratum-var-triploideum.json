    "intro": "Polygonatum odoratum var. triploideum, commonly known as the fragrant Solomon's seal, is a variant of the Solomon's seal plant characterized by its triploid genome. It is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia, particularly China, and thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces attractive, bell-shaped white flowers followed by red berries, which are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are lance-shaped and form a dense rosette, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. The variant is noted for its unique genetic makeup, which may influence its growth habits and floral characteristics compared to the typical diploid form."
