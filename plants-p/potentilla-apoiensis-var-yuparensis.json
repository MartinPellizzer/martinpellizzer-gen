    "intro": "Potentilla apoiensis var. yuparensis, commonly known as the Yuparensis cinquefoil, is a flowering plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are densely arranged along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
