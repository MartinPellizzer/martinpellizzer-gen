    "intro": "Platycerium, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain through its rhizomes. Platycerium species are often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Their intricate frond structure provides habitat for various small organisms, contributing to ecological diversity."
