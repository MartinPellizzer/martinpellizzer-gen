    "intro": "Picea excelsa subvar. lata, commonly known as the broadleaf white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its broad, flat needles and conical shape, adapted to cold and arid environments. The tree produces small, pale yellow cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against harsh weather conditions. This subvariety is valued for its resilience and is often found in alpine forests at elevations above 3,000 meters."
