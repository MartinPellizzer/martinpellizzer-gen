    "intro": "Petrorhagia zoharyana, commonly known as the Armenian rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, gray-green, and covered in a fine layer of hair, helping to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
