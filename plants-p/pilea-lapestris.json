    "intro": "Pilea lapestris, commonly known as the rock pilea, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features a compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its slow growth and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
