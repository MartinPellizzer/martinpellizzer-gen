    "intro": "Pygeum vulgare, commonly known as the African wild almond, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, rounded canopy and leathery, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The tree is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
