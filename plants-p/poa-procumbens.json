    "intro": "Poa procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on the ground, often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it resilient in various environmental conditions. Poa procumbens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small organisms."
