It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its growth habit is slow, making it a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts of succulents. Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled settings to ensure its survival."
