    "intro": "Pyrus pyraster var. javorkae, commonly known as the Javornik pear, is a rare variant of the common pear species. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tien Shan and Pamir Mountains. This plant is characterized by its small, often clustered fruit and thick, hairy leaves. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates. The botanical interest in this variety lies in its unique morphology and potential for genetic diversity in pear species."
