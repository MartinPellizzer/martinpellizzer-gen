    "intro": "Parodia chlorocarpa, commonly known as the green fruit cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and pale green to bluish-green stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. Its spines are short and cylindrical, providing protection from herbivores. Parodia chlorocarpa is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
