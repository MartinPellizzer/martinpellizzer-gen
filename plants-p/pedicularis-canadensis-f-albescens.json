    "intro": "Pedicularis canadensis f. albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered lousewort, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain some of its nutrients. The plant is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
