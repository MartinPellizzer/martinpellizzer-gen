    "intro": "Pteroceras pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf horned liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or under leaf litter. The plant has a distinctive thalloid structure with a central stem and lateral branches, and it produces small, flask-shaped sporangia that release spores. Its leaves are usually scale-like and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its compact appearance. Pteroceras pusillus is often found in temperate regions and is a common indicator species for humid, shaded microhabitats."
