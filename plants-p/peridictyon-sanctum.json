    "intro": "Peridictyon sanctum, commonly known as the sacred bloom of the Eldertree, is a rare and mystical plant found in the heart of the ancient forest of Velmora. Its leaves are a deep emerald green, veined with bioluminescent blue streaks that glow faintly at night. The flowers, which bloom once every century, emit a soft, golden light and are said to contain the essence of the forest's magic. The plant's roots are intertwined with the roots of the Eldertree, forming a symbiotic relationship that sustains both species. Due to its rarity and magical properties, Peridictyon sanctum is highly revered and protected by the forest's guardians."
