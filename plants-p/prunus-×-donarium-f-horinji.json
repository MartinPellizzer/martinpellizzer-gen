    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 donarium f. horinji, commonly known as the Horinji cherry, is a decorative cherry tree prized for its ornamental value. It is a hybrid of Prunus lusitanica and Prunus serrula, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The tree produces showy, semi-double pink flowers in early spring, adding visual interest to gardens. Its foliage turns a vibrant red in autumn, enhancing its seasonal appeal. The Horinji cherry is often cultivated for its aesthetic beauty rather than for fruit production."
