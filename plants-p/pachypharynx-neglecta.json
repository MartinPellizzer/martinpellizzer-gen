    "intro": "Pachypharynx neglecta, commonly known as the neglected thick-throated plant, is a member of the Apocynaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It is native to tropical regions and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat."
