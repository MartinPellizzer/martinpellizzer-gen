    "intro": "Primula tanneri var. peralata, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features rosettes of dark green, velvety leaves that are densely packed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
