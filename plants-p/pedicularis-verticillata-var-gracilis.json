    "intro": "Pedicularis verticillata var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are opposite and often lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This species is part of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its parasitic or semi-parasitic relationships with host plants."
