It is a perennial plant characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green hue, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for erosion control."
