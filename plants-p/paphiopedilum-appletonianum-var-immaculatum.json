    "intro": "Paphiopedilum appletonianum var. immaculatum, commonly known as the Appleton's ghost orchid, is a rare and exquisite epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, greenish-yellow petals and a unique, spurred lip that resembles a ghostly face, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on humid, shaded environments for optimal growth. Its flowers bloom in late summer or early autumn, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in conservation programs."
