    "intro": "Pycnandra sarlinii, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to the dry, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
