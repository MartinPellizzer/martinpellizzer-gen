    "intro": "Pedicularis obliqua, commonly known as the zigzag lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest in both botanical studies and conservation efforts."
