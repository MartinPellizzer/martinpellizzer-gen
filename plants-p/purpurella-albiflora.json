    "intro": "Purpurella albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered purple bell, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking purple petals that transition to a pale white at the base, creating a unique visual contrast. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The flowers bloom in late spring and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects."
