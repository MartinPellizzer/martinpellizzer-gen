    "intro": "Polypodium anisomeron, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that varies among individuals. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries like India and China. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds."
