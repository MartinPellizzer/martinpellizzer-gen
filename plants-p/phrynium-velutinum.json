    "intro": "Phrynium velutinum, commonly known as the velvet phrynium, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces striking, orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are not true flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Phrynium velutinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
