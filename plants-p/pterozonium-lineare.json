It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or stream banks. It has a taproot system and produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
