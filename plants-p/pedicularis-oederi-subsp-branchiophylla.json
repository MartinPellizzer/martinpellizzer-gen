    "intro": "Pedicularis oederi subsp. branchiophylla, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its vivid yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine regions, often in rocky or mossy habitats. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
