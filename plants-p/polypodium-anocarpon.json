    "intro": "Polypodium anocarpon, commonly known as the rock polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous areas. The plant has a compact, creeping rhizome with dense, linear fronds that are leathery and dark green. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium anocarpon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
