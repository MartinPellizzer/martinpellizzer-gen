    "intro": "Potentilla shockleyi var. ostleri, commonly known as the desert cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects in arid landscapes."
