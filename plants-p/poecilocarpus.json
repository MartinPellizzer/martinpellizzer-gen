    "intro": "Poecilocarpus, commonly known as the blue bean or false pomegranate, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These shrubs or small trees are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale blue. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Poecilocarpus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
