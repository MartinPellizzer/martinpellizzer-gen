It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a slightly hairy surface. The flowers are usually pale pink to white, with a distinctive spurred petal that aids in pollination by insects. This variant is noted for its dense inflorescences, which give it its common name."
