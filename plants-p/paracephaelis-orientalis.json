    "intro": "Paracephaelis orientalis, commonly known as the oriental ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and accumulated debris. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often clustered at the base, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Paracephaelis orientalis is considered endangered and is often found in protected natural reserves."
