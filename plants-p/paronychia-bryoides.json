    "intro": "Paronychia bryoides, commonly known as the mossy cushion plant, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are inconspicuous, typically green or reddish, and appear in clusters. Paronychia bryoides thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments."
