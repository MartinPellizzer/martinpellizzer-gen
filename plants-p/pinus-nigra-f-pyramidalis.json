    "intro": "Pinus nigra f. pyramidalis, commonly known as the Italian stone pine, is a compact, conical shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is a dwarf form of the common stone pine, characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and slow growth rate. The plant features dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long, arranged in pairs. Its cones are woody and can persist on the tree for several years, adding to its ornamental value. This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and resilience in rocky or poor soils."
