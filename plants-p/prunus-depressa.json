    "intro": "Prunus depressa, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or Japanese dwarf cherry, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to Japan. It features small, oval leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and it produces clusters of delicate, white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a border plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, requiring minimal maintenance once established. Prunus depressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to add a touch of elegance to garden landscapes."
