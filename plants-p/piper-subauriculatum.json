    "intro": "Piper subauriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate pepper vine, is a tropical climbing plant belonging to the Piperaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with distinctive auriculate (ear-like) lobes at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in spikes, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
