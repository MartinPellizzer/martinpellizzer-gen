    "intro": "Potamogeton filiformis f. major, commonly known as the broad-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments. It features long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically wider than those of the typical form, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like structures, which are often submerged or just below the water surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. This species is often found in slow-moving or still waters, such as lakes and ponds."
