    "intro": "Pseudopodospermum molle subsp. molle, commonly known as the soft pseudopodospermum, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
