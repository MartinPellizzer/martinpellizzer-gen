It features slender, upright culms covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a light green color that adds a refined aesthetic to gardens. This bamboo is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in landscape design for its elegant, upright growth habit."
