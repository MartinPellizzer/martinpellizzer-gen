It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red when mature. The berries contain the aromatic seeds used as a spice, known as black pepper. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires support for its climbing growth habit."
