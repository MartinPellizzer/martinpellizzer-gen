    "intro": "Platantheroides eustachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense colonies in wet meadows and fen environments. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
