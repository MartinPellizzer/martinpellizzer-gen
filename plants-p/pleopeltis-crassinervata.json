    "intro": "Pleopeltis crassinervata, commonly known as the broad-veined tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a prominent, broad midrib, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant's unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation in tropical gardens."
