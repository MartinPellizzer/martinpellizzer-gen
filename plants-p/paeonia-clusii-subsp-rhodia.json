    "intro": "Paeonia clusii subsp. rhodia, commonly known as the Rhodian peony, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of the Eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, white, and red, with a distinctive double or semi-double petal structure. The plant has deeply lobed, dark green leaves and is adapted to grow in well-drained, calcareous soils. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens. Due to its limited natural range and susceptibility to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
