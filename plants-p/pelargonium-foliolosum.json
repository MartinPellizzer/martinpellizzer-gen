    "intro": "Pelargonium foliolosum, commonly known as the leafless geranium, is a unique member of the Geraniaceae family characterized by its distinctive botanical features. It is native to South Africa and is known for its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Unlike most geraniums, it has reduced foliage, with only a few small leaves near the base of the plant. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its unusual appearance and ornamental value make it a sought-after species among horticulturists and plant enthusiasts."
