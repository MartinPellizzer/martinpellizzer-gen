    "intro": "Pedicularis cadmea var. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered lousewort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, characterized by its parasitic or hemiparasitic growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its striking red or orange flowers are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences, and it produces small, oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native range."
