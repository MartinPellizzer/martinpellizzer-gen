    "intro": "Paepalanthus insignis, commonly known as the Andean sunflower, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, sunny conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed along the stem. Paepalanthus insignis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
