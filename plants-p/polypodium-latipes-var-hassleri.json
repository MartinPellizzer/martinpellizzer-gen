    "intro": "Polypodium latipes var. hassleri, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed polypody. It is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States, typically found growing on rocky outcrops and cliffs. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with dark green, hairy leaves that are leathery in texture. Its fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with small, sporangia-bearing pinnae that produce spores for reproduction. This variety is well adapted to harsh, sunny environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
