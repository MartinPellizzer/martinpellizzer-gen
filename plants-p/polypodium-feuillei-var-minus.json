    "intro": "Polypodium feuillei var. minus, commonly known as the lesser wall fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
