    "intro": "Phlebodium serpens, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, tree-like fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, giving it its common name. The plant lacks true roots and instead uses its rhizomes to anchor itself to trees or rocks. Its leaves are thick and leathery, often forming a dense, umbrella-like structure. Phlebodium serpens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular in horticulture for its ornamental appearance."
