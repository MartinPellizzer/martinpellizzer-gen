    "intro": "Ponerorchis sichuanica, commonly known as the Sichuan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, terrestrial growth habit. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a subtle fragrance, typically blooming in late spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky soil in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
