    "intro": "Panax bipinnatifidus var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ginseng, is a rare and valuable plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its bipinnatifid leaves, which are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed. Its roots are highly prized in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits, though they are less commercially significant than those of Panax ginseng. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species."
