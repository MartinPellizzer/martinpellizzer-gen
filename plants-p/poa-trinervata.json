    "intro": "Poa trinervata, commonly known as the three-veined grass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with distinct three veins. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Poa trinervata is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
