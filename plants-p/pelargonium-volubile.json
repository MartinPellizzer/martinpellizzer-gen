    "intro": "Pelargonium volubile, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a trailing perennial plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves that have a velvety texture and a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Due to its trailing habit, it is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover in gardens."
