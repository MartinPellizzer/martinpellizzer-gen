    "intro": "Panicum spissifolium, commonly known as stiffleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it a hardy and adaptable species within its native range."
