    "intro": "Paxia cinnabarina, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and endangered species native to the island of Madagascar. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its unique, elongated leaves and striking red flowers. The plant belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is known for its dense, aromatic wood, which has historically been highly valued. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now critically endangered, prompting conservation efforts to protect its remaining populations. Its botanical features make it an important subject in both ecological and horticultural studies."
