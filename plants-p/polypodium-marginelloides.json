    "intro": "Polypodium marginelloides, commonly known as the margin-leaf polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread along the forest floor or rock surfaces. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a narrow, serrated margin that gives it its common name. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions of the Americas."
