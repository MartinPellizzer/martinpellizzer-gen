    "intro": "Polygonum pensylvanicum f. albinum, commonly known as the white-veined smartweed, is a variant of the common smartweed characterized by its distinctive white veins on the leaves. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, disturbed soils such as along stream banks and in wet meadows. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink to red in color, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This form is notable for its unique leaf venation pattern, which sets it apart from the typical green-veined variety of Polygonum pensylvanicum."
