    "intro": "Penthea patens, commonly known as the creeping penthea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Penthea patens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover."
