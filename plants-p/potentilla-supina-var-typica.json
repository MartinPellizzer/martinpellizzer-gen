It features wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval to ovate, with a rough, serrated margin. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover."
