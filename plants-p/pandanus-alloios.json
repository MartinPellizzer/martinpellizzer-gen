    "intro": "Pandanus alloios, commonly known as the red pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, paddle-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters at the top of the plant. Its roots are sometimes used in local medicine for their purported healing properties. The red pandanus is well adapted to coastal and tropical environments, thriving in sandy soils and high humidity."
