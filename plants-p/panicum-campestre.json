    "intro": "Panicum campestre, commonly known as yellow bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and features narrow, blue-green blades that turn golden in the fall. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it ecologically valuable in prairie and restoration ecosystems."
