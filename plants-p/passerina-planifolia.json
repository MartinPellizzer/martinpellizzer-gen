    "intro": "Passerina planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf pasqueflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its basal leaves that are broadly ovate and often hairy. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
