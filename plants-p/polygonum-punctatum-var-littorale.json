    "intro": "Polygonum punctatum var. littorale, commonly known as salt marsh knotweed, is a halophytic plant adapted to coastal environments. It thrives in brackish or saline soils and is often found in estuaries and tidal marshes. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or pale green midrib. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in coastal areas."
