    "intro": "Pilosella caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted goatherb, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a dense, tufted growth habit, often forming small, compact clumps. The plant features grayish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in flat-topped clusters, blooming in early summer. Pilosella caespitosa is often found in dry meadows, rocky soils, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained conditions."
