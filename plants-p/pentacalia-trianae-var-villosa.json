    "intro": "Pentacalia trianae var. villosa, commonly known as the woolly pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Colombia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, or villosa, foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically yellow or white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercialized."
