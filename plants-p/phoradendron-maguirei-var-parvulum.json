    "intro": "Phoradendron maguirei var. parvulum, commonly known as the small-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southeastern United States. It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily oaks and hickories, and relies on them for water and nutrients while performing photosynthesis. Its small, white or pale green flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are consumed by birds. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both vegetative growth and seed dispersal by animals. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by supporting bird populations and contributing to forest biodiversity."
