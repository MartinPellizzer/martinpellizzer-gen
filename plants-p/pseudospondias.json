    "intro": "Pseudospondias, commonly known as the wild cashew or Indian cashew, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae. It comprises several species, most of which are native to tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. These plants typically grow as trees or shrubs, featuring compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The fruits are usually drupes, containing a single seed enclosed in a hard shell. Pseudospondias species are valued for their ornamental appeal and, in some cases, for their edible fruits."
