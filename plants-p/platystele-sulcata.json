    "intro": "Platystele sulcata, commonly known as the sulcate platystele, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its short, compact rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that form a water-holding cup. It produces small, white flowers that are typically short-lived, and it relies on specific microhabitats for survival. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Platystele sulcata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
