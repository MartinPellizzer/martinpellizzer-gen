    "intro": "Platanthera orbiculata f. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, pouch-like flower that is typically white or pale pink, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. The plant produces long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a rosette, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and bogs. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate appearance and ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
