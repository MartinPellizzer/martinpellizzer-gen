    "intro": "Potentilla parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Potentilla parvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic value."
