    "intro": "Polypodium papilliferum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a rough, papillate surface. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates or in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures, contributing to its common name. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
