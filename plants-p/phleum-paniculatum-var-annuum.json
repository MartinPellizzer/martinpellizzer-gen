    "intro": "Phleum paniculatum var. annuum, commonly known as Timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, slender stalks with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, greenish flowers. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to drought and cold temperatures. Timothy grass is often used in forage production and as a cover crop due to its hardiness and rapid growth. Its botanical structure supports its role in both agricultural and ecological systems."
