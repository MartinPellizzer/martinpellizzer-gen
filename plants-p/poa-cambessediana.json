    "intro": "Poa cambessediana, commonly known as the Cambessedina grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, particularly in countries like Bolivia and Peru. This perennial herb typically grows in rocky and arid environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. Its slender, tufted growth form and small, spike-like inflorescences are characteristic of many alpine grasses. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying adaptation to extreme environments."
