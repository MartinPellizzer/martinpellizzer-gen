    "intro": "Pyrus malus var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly apple tree, is a variant of the domestic apple that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its dense, white tomentose (fuzzy) covering on young shoots and leaves, which provides a unique visual appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a pubescent underside. The flowers are white with five petals, and the fruit is a small, usually yellow or green apple with a tart flavor. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and winter interest."
