    "intro": "Prunus sativa var. subvestita, commonly known as the Chinese date or jujube, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to edible, orange-red fruits resembling dates. The plant is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. The fruit is rich in sugars, vitamins, and antioxidants, making it both nutritious and commercially valuable."
