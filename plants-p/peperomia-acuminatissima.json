It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, often with a waxy texture and a vibrant green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, emerging from the leaf axils. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and drought tolerance.
