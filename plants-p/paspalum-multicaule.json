    "intro": "Paspalum multicaule, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in dunes or salt marshes. Due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils, it plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
