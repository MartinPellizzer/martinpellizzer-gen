    "intro": "Pellaea atropurpurea var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf purple maidenhair fern, is a compact variety of the purple maidenhair fern native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive purple hue on the underside, which becomes more pronounced in shade. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it ideal for woodland gardens. Its rhizomes spread slowly, forming a low-growing clump that adds texture to shaded landscapes. The foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, providing year-round interest in the garden."
