    "intro": "Penstemon vaseyanus, commonly known as the Persian beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and spikes of tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing vivid purple to pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Penstemon vaseyanus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and adaptability to well-drained soils."
