    "intro": "Pulicaria filaginoides, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Pulicaria filaginoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
