    "intro": "Phalaris canariensis var. tenuis, commonly known as narrowleaf marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. This plant thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
