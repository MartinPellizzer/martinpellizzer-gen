    "intro": "Peniocereus diguetii, commonly known as the night-blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a flowering cactus that produces delicate, star-shaped flowers that open at night. The plant has a short, cylindrical stem with sparse, spiny areoles. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its nocturnal blooming habit is an adaptation to attract specific pollinators active during the evening hours."
