    "intro": "Paraberlinia bifoliolata, commonly known as the two-leafed senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant features bipinnate leaves, with each leaflet being small and oval-shaped. It produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind or animal contact."
