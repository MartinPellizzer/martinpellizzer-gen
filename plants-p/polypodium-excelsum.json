    "intro": "Polypodium excelsum, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on cliffs or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its leaves are pinnately compound with a distinctive, serrated margin. Polypodium excelsum is well adapted to humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
