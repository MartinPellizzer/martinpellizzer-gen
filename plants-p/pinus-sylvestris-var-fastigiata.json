    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. fastigiata, commonly known as the stiff pine or upright Scots pine, is a variety of the Scots pine characterized by its dense, columnar growth habit. It is native to northern Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its neat, upright form. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces cones that are woody and persist on the tree for several years. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for garden and landscape settings. This variety is also valued for its ability to withstand harsh weather conditions, including cold and wind."
