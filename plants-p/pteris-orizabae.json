    "intro": "Pteris orizabae, commonly known as the Oaxaca water fern, is a species of fern native to Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across the water surface. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Pteris orizabae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
