    "intro": "Prunus avium f. duracina, commonly known as the dwarf cherry, is a compact form of the sweet cherry tree. It exhibits a slower growth rate compared to the standard Prunus avium, making it ideal for smaller gardens or container cultivation. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically sweeter and more intensely flavored than those of the standard variety. It is valued for its ornamental appeal, featuring attractive spring blossoms and attractive bark. This form is often used in horticultural displays and as a rootstock for grafting other cherry varieties."
