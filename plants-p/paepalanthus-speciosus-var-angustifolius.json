It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red or pink. The plant thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its habitat."
