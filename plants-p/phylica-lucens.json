    "intro": "Phylica lucens, commonly known as the candle bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble candles, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are leathery and aromatic, contributing to its ornamental value. Phylica lucens is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
