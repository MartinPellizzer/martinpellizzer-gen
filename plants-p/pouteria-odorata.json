    "intro": "Pouteria odorata, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are highly fragrant. The tree's most notable feature is its edible, oily seeds, which are encased in a hard, woody shell. Pouteria odorata can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a long lifespan, often living for over 100 years. It plays an important ecological role in the rainforest by providing food for various wildlife species."
