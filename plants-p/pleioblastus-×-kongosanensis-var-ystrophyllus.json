    "intro": "Pleioblastus \u00d7 kongosanensis var. ystrophyllus, commonly known as the silver bamboo, is a variant of the Korean bamboo species. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-blue foliage, which results from a dense layer of fine, hair-like trichomes on the leaf surfaces. The plant is a clump-forming perennial, typically growing to a height of 1 to 2 meters. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly curled margin. It is well-suited for ornamental use in gardens and is valued for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
