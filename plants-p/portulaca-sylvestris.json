    "intro": "Portulaca sylvestris, commonly known as the wild purslane, is a low-growing annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features fleshy, succulent leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in disturbed areas and gardens. Its stems and leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Portulaca sylvestris is also known for its edible leaves, which are rich in nutrients and have a slightly tart flavor."
