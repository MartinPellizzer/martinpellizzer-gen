    "intro": "Pinus mugo var. palustris, commonly known as the swamp mountain pine, is a variant of the creeping pine that thrives in moist, acidic soils. It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and short, twisted branches. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its needles are typically dark green and remain on the plant for several years before shedding. This variant is well adapted to wetland environments and is often found in bogs and heathlands."
