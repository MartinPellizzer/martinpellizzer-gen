    "intro": "Pedicularis tubiformis, commonly known as the monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its unique, tubular-shaped flowers that resemble a monkey's face. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. Its blooming period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
