    "intro": "Populus euxylon, commonly known as the narrowleaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its bark is smooth and grayish in color, and it often grows in moist, well-drained soils near rivers or streams. Populus euxylon is valued for its fast growth and has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
