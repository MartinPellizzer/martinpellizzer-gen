    "intro": "Polystichum pulogense, commonly known as the Pulau Penang holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while facilitating nutrient absorption. Polystichum pulogense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
