    "intro": "Phaeocephalum microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited phaeocephalum, is a member of the Ericaceae family. It is a shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically clustered at the ends of its twigs. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions with cool, moist climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
