    "intro": "Polemonium confertum, commonly known as the clusteredJacob's ladder, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features upright, branching stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shade gardens and naturalized landscapes."
