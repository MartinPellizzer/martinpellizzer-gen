    "intro": "Prestoea acuminata var. montana, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, while its flowers are often visited by hummingbirds and bees. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
