    "intro": "Pimpinella saxifraga var. procera, commonly known as the tall cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are finely divided and fern-like, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
