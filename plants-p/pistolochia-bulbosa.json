    "intro": "Pistolochia bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble small bladders, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are usually small and narrow. The species is part of the legume family and has a long history of use by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes."
