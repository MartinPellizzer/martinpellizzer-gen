    "intro": "Poa squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly meadowgrass, is a species of grass native to various parts of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, often silver-tomentose leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and roadside areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa squarrosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
