    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 spuria, commonly known as the wild pear or spindle tree, is a hybrid species in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces white or pink flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart pears in the fall. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and fruit production, it is cultivated in gardens and for local food use."
