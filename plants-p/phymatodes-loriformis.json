It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble small bladders, which are a key feature in its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Phymatodes loriformis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various insects and small animals."
