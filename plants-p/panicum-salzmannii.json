    "intro": "Panicum salzmannii, commonly known as Salzmann's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of small, spikelet-like flowers. Panicum salzmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its delicate, feathery appearance."
