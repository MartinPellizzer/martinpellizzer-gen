    "intro": "Phyllota urodon, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Phyllota urodon is adapted to survive in dry environments with deep root systems and waxy leaves to reduce water loss. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not as well-known as other milkweed species."
