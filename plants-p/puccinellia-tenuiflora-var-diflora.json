This variant is typically found in saline or coastal environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant has a low-growing habit and produces flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late summer. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy or disturbed soils."
