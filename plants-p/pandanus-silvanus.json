    "intro": "Pandanus silvanus, commonly known as the mountain pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by fibrous, spiky fruits. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and as thatching material in some regions. The species is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous or coastal areas."
