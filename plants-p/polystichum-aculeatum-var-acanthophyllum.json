    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. acanthophyllum, commonly known as the acanthophyllum fern, is a variant of the common holly fern. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often deeply divided. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its lush, textured foliage."
