    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 subternata, commonly known as the evergreen potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, compact growth with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardiness and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
