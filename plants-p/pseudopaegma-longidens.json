    "intro": "Pseudopaegma longidens, commonly known as the long-spined holly, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers in the spring, which are clustered in umbels. Its berries, which are dark red when mature, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Pseudopaegma longidens is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and naturalistic appearance."
