It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that spiral around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in dense clusters, often arranged in a whorled pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique growth form and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural gardens."
