It typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and are followed by edible, apple-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin. Pyrus ascendens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
