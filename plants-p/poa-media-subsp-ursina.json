    "intro": "Poa media subsp. ursina, commonly known as the alpine meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, tufted culms with small, spikelet-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
