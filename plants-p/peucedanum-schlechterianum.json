    "intro": "Peucedanum schlechterianum, commonly known as the Schlechter's angelica, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a tall, slender stem and a distinctive, aromatic odor. Its seeds are small, oval, and often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The botanical features of Peucedanum schlechterianum make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
