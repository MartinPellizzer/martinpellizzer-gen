    "intro": "Persicaria hirsuta, commonly known as hairy knotweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, triangular stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, stream banks, and marshy areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy texture, and the flowers are usually pink or red, appearing in late summer. Persicaria hirsuta is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
