    "intro": "Psilocarphus oregonus, commonly known as the Oregon psilocarphus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and forest edges. While not psychoactive, it is closely related to other plants in the genus that contain hallucinogenic compounds."
