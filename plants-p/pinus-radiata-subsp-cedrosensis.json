    "intro": "Pinus radiata subsp. cedrosensis, commonly known as Cedros Island pine, is a subspecies native to the Channel Islands off the coast of California. It is a medium-sized evergreen conifer with slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The cones are woody and cylindrical, containing edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is adapted to coastal climates and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Pinus species, particularly in its leaf structure and geographic distribution."
