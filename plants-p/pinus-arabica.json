    "intro": "Pinus arabica, commonly known as the Arabian pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, needle-like foliage that forms a pyramidal shape. The plant produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Its needles are typically dark green and can grow up to 10 centimeters in length. Pinus arabica is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
