    "intro": "Philodendron montanum, commonly known as the mountain philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a glossy surface and veins that are prominently visible. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Its rapid growth and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
