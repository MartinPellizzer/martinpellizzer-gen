    "intro": "Pentacalia caliana, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its roots forming a dense network in the soil. It thrives in moist, acidic environments, typically found in shaded, swampy areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
