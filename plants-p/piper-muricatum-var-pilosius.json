It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to the common soursop but has a distinctive hairy texture on its surface. It is valued for its aromatic foliage and the edible fruit, which has a creamy, yellow pulp with a sweet and sour flavor. The species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and in traditional medicine."
