It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are generally ovate to elliptic in shape and have a rough texture due to the presence of fine pubescence. The species is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
