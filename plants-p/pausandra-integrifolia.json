    "intro": "Pausandra integrifolia, commonly known as American bellflower, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually entire or slightly toothed. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas with rich, organic soil. Pausandra integrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
