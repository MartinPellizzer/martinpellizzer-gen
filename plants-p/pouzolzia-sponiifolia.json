    "intro": "Pouzolzia sponiifolia, commonly known as the spongeleaf pouzolzia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with moist, shaded habitats. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, spongy-textured leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. Pouzolzia sponiifolia is often found in forest understories and is adapted to thrive in humid, low-light environments."
