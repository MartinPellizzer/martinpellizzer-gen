    "intro": "Phaseolus tomentosus, commonly known as the hairy bean, is a species of legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, cylindrical pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional value. Due to its genetic diversity, it is also of interest in agricultural research for improving crop resilience."
