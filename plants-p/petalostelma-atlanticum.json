    "intro": "Petalostelma atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic petalostelma, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the western Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its flowering period typically occurs during the late spring and early summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
