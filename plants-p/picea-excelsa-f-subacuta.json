    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. subacuta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are narrower and more pointed than those of the typical white spruce. The plant exhibits cold tolerance and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies plays a significant ecological role in alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
