    "intro": "Physospermopsis handelii, commonly known as the African ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic member of the family Olacaceae. It is native to arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its striking, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
