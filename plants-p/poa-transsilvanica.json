    "intro": "Poa transsilvanica, commonly known as Transylvanian bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa transsilvanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
