    "intro": "Polygonum thunbergii var. stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively through stolons and rhizomes. The plant typically has heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or red. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both an ecological pioneer and a potential invasive species in non-native regions."
