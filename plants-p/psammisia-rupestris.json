    "intro": "Psammisia rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and are followed by fluffy seed heads. Psammisia rupestris is often found in crevices and on rocky outcrops, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
