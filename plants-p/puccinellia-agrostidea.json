    "intro": "Puccinellia agrostidea, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its fine, silver-haired leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tussocks. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its flowering spikes are usually slender and spike-like, bearing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Puccinellia agrostidea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
