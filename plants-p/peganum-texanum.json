    "intro": "Peganum texanum, commonly known as Texas pricklypear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spiny shrub that typically reaches heights of 1 to 3 feet. The plant features paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are yellow or orange and bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant is well adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing desert soils."
