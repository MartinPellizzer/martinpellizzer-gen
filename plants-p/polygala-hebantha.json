    "intro": "Polygala hebantha, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Polygala genus. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, where it thrives in wetlands and marshy areas. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers that resemble orchids, hence its common name. It is a herbaceous perennial with a fibrous root system and narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its limited habitat and ecological sensitivity, it is considered endangered and requires specific conservation efforts to survive."
