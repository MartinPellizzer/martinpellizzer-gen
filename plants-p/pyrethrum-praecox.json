It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. The plant produces small, spherical seed heads that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Pyrethrum praecox is also valued for its natural insect-repelling properties due to the presence of pyrethrins in its flowers."
