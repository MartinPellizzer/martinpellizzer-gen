    "intro": "Psychotria mangorensis, commonly known as the Mangore psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Central and South America, particularly in regions of Mexico, Guatemala, and Costa Rica. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It is often found growing in shaded, humid environments within the understory of tropical forests. Psychotria mangorensis is also known for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
