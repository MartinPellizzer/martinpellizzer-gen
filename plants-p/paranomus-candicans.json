    "intro": "Paranomus candicans, commonly known as the shining parasol tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its bark is smooth and light grey, with a distinctive, almost waxy texture. The leaves are usually clustered at the base of the plant, forming a dense, shade-providing canopy."
