    "intro": "Polypodium murkeleanum, commonly known as the Indian cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its rhizome is thick and wiry, anchoring it to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds."
