    "intro": "Pteronia divaricata, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are aromatic and often used in traditional medicine. Pteronia divaricata is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature."
