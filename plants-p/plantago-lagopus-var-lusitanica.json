    "intro": "Plantago lagopus var. lusitanica, commonly known as the European plantain, is a variant of the common plantain, characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology and growth habits. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and parts of North Africa, typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variant is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
