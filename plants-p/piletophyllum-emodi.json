    "intro": "Piletophyllum emodi, commonly known as the Himalayan snowbell, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a slender, upright stem with simple, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
