    "intro": "Pedilonum kentrochilum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. The narrow-lobed holly fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
