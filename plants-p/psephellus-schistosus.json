    "intro": "Psephellus schistosus, commonly known as the rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments. It typically grows in dry, well-drained soils, often found in mountainous regions. The plant has small, green leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. Psephellus schistosus is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
