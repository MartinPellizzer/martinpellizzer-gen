    "intro": "Podocarpus oleifolius var. trujillensis, commonly known as the Trujillense Podocarpus, is a species of coniferous tree native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of narrow, leathery leaves arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, a feature typical of the Podocarpaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
