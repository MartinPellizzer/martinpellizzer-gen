    "intro": "Populus cathayana var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which appear in the spring before the leaves fully emerge. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
