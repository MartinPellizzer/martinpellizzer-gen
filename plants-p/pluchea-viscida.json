    "intro": "Pluchea viscida, commonly known as stickyleaf or yellow false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, which are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are covered in fine, sticky hairs, giving it its common name and aiding in water retention. Pluchea viscida is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streambanks."
