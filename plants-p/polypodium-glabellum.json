    "intro": "Polypodium glabellum, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of polypody that thrives in rocky, shaded environments. It is a perennial fern with a rhizomatous growth habit, producing delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone cliffs. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
