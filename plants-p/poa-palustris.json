    "intro": "Poa palustris, commonly known as swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers that produce seeds dispersed by wind. Poa palustris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
