    "intro": "Primula multiscapa, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are often heart-shaped. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its cold climate adaptation, it is a hardy species that is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions."
