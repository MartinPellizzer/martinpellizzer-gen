    "intro": "Pandanus leucocephalus, commonly known as the white-headed pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in a dense inflorescence, giving it its common name. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as a natural dye due to their fibrous texture. The plant thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing near mangroves or in sandy soils."
