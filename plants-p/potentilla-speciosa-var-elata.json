It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes.
