    "intro": "Phegopteris wurunuran, commonly known as the Wurunuran water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along stream banks or in swampy areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its natural habitat."
