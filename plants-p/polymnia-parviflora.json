    "intro": "Polymnia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered polymnia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
