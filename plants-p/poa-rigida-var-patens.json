    "intro": "Poa rigida var. patens, commonly known as the creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a dense, mat-forming growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread rapidly and form extensive turf-like covers."
