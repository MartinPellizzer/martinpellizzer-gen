    "intro": "Potentilla concinna var. typica, commonly known as the common cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are alternate along the stems, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for gardens and natural habitats. Potentilla concinna var. typica is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
