It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments, often in shaded forest understories. Its fronds are usually light green to silver in color, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant in suitable climates."
