    "intro": "Pongamia ferruginea, commonly known as the Indian beech or velvet bean tree, is a leguminous plant native to tropical Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Pongamia ferruginea is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and potential use in agroforestry systems."
