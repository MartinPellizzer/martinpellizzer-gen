    "intro": "Polystachya calyptrata, commonly known as the calyptrate spikegrass, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, branched inflorescences that bear numerous small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swampy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The species is also noted for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique floral structure."
