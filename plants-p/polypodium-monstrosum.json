    "intro": "Polypodium monstrosum, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The fronds are typically dark green with a leathery texture, and they can produce sporangia on the underside of the leaves."
