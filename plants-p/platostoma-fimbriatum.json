    "intro": "Platostoma fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fringed fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive fimbriate margin that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
