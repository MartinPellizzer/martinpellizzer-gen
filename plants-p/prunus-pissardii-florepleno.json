    "intro": "Prunus pissardii florepleno, commonly known as the double-flowered Japanese cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its profuse display of double flowers, which consist of numerous petals and lack the typical stamens and pistils found in single-flowered varieties. The leaves are oval, serrated, and turn a vibrant yellow in autumn, adding to its ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. This cultivar is prized for its showy blooms and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
