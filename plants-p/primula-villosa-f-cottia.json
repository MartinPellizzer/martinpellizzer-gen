    "intro": "Primula villosa f. cottia, commonly known as the woolly primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to retain moisture and protect against harsh weather. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
