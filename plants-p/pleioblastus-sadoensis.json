It features slender, arching culms that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, followed by narrow, linear leaves that are dense and upright. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its delicate appearance, it is a popular choice for garden landscapes and rock gardens."
