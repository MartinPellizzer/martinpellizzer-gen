It is characterized by its robust, succulent-like leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
