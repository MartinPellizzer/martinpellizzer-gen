    "intro": "Pterocaulon pilcomayense, commonly known as the Andean spurge, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
