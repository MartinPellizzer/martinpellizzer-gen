It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright orange or red berries. It has a hairy texture on its stems and leaves, and its root system is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy and adaptable species."
