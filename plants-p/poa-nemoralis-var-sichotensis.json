    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. sichotensis, commonly known as the Sichotian meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass native to the temperate regions of East Asia. This grass species typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
