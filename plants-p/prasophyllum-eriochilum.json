    "intro": "Prasophyllum eriochilum, commonly known as the woolly leek orchid, is an Australian native plant belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, pale green to brownish flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in heathland and open forest habitats, often in well-drained soils. It is a terrestrial orchid with a short-lived, underground rhizome that supports its growth cycle. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
