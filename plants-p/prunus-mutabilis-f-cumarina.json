It is characterized by its small to medium-sized fruits that transition from a yellowish-green to a deep red or purple color as they ripen. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 3 to 6 meters. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces fragrant white flowers in early spring. The fruit is often used in culinary applications, including jams, pies, and desserts, due to its tart flavor."
