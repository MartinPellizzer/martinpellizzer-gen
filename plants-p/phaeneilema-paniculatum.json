    "intro": "Phaeneilema paniculatum, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Phaeneilema paniculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
