    "intro": "Pyrus yamayensis, commonly known as the Yamay\u00e9 pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the subtropical regions of southern China and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are typically harvested when they are fully ripe. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and fragrant blooms. However, it is not widely cultivated for fruit production due to its limited yield and specific climate requirements."
