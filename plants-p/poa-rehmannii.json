    "intro": "Poa rehmannii, commonly known as the Rehmann\u2019s bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and forest understories. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
