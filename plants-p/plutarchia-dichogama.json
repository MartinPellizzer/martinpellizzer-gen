    "intro": "Plutarchia dichogama, commonly known as the yellow nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has hairy stems and leaves with a serrated edge, typical of many nightshade species. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. The species is notable for its dioecious nature, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants."
