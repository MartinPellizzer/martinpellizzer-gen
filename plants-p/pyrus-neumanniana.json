It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, grey-barked trunk. The tree produces small, clustered white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, yellowish pomes that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn a vibrant yellow in autumn. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
