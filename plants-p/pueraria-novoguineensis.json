It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of purple or white flowers. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several round, hard seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
