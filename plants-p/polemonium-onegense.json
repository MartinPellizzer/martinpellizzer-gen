    "intro": "Polemonium onegense, commonly known as Onegense Jacob's ladder, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northeastern United States. It features upright, branching stems that bear opposite pairs of lance-shaped leaves, giving it a ladder-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded to partially shaded areas. Its showy blooms attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
