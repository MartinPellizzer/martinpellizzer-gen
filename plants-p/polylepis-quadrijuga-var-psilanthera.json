    "intro": "Polylepis quadrijuga var. psilanthera, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a member of the Rosaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support in the harsh mountain climate. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
