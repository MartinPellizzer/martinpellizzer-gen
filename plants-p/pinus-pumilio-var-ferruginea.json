    "intro": "Pinus pumilio var. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty dwarf pine, is a variant of the dwarf mountain pine native to the Andes mountains. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the standard Pinus pumilio. The leaves often have a reddish-brown or rusty-colored sheath, giving the plant its common name. This variety thrives in high-altitude environments with cold climates and well-drained soils. It is an important species in alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability in its native range."
