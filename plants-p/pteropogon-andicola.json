    "intro": "Pteropogon andicola, commonly known as the Andean pteropogon, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant blooms. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from poor soil, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Pteropogon andicola is considered a rare and specialized species."
