    "intro": "Pachystelis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and its ability to grow without soil, relying instead on the roots of trees for nutrients. The plant produces striking white or pale purple flowers that bloom during the summer months. Pachystelis is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate, ephemeral appearance. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species."
