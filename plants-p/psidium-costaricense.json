    "intro": "Psidium costaricense, commonly known as the pineapple guava, is a tropical plant native to Central America. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that can grow up to 4 meters tall. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, pear-shaped berry with a sweet, aromatic flavor. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat."
