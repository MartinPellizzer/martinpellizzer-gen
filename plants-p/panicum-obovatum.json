    "intro": "Panicum obovatum, commonly known as the broad-ovate panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize moist habitats. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
