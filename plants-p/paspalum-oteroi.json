    "intro": "Paspalum oteroi, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Paspalum oteroi is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
