    "intro": "Peplis diandra f. aquatica, commonly known as the aquatic peplis, is a variant of the peplis diandra species that thrives in wetland and aquatic environments. It is characterized by its submerged or floating leaves, which are typically narrow and elongated to facilitate water movement. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are adapted for pollination by waterborne vectors. Its rhizomes are often extensive, allowing it to spread across muddy substrates in ponds and marshes. This variant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
