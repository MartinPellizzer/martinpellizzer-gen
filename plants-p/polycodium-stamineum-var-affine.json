    "intro": "Polycodium stamineum var. affine, commonly known as the narrow-leaved polycodium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
