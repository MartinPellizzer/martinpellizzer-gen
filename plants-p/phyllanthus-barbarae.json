    "intro": "Phyllanthus barbarae, commonly known as the African date palm, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are borne on the branches. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and is typically consumed by both humans and animals in its native habitat."
