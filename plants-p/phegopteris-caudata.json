    "intro": "Phegopteris caudata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a striking fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its long, drooping fronds that give it a distinctive, almost ornamental appearance. The plant features a tall, slender sterile stalk topped with a dense cluster of fertile spore-bearing leaves. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The cinnamon fern is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the forest floor's ecological diversity."
