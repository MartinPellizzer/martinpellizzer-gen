    "intro": "Plantaginorchis engleriana, commonly known as the Engler's plantain orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
