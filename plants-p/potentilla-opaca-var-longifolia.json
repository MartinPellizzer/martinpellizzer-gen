    "intro": "Potentilla opaca var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they remain evergreen throughout the year. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural use in native plant gardens."
