    "intro": "Piper elbancoanum, commonly known as the Elbanco pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, slender stems that often trail along the ground or climb supports. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while the small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes. The fruit, a small, three-lobed berry, is typically harvested when mature and used in local cuisines for its mild peppery flavor."
