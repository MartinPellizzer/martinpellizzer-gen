    "intro": "Phleum asperum var. japonicum, commonly known as Japanese Timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that grow upright, often reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a rough texture that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are clustered along the stem, typical of the Poaceae family. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
