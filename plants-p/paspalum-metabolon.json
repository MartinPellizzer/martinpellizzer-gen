    "intro": "Paspalum metabolon, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a grass species native to coastal regions of Australia and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common species in dune environments. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that produce lightweight seeds for wind dispersal. Paspalum metabolon plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
