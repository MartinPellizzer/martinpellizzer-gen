    "intro": "Potentilla pseudofrigida, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with woody stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are typically palmately divided, and it produces small, aggregate fruits that contain several seeds. Potentilla pseudofrigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
