    "intro": "Phaius sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white blossoms with a distinct three-lobed lip. Phaius sinensis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
