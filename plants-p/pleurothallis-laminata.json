    "intro": "Pleurothallis laminata, commonly known as the laminated pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, strap-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
