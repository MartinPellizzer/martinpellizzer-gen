    "intro": "Pongamia caudata, commonly known as the Indian beech or pongam, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, flat, pod-like fruits containing oily seeds. Pongamia caudata is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its seeds are rich in oil, making it an important species for both ecological and potential industrial uses."
