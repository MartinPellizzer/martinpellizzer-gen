    "intro": "Prunus \u00d7 lannesiana f. kirin, commonly known as the Kirin cherry, is a unique and ornamental flowering plant native to Japan. It is a natural hybrid between Prunus lannesiana and Prunus incisa, characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often twisted petals. The plant produces small, sweet fruits that are edible but not commonly cultivated for commercial use. Its flowers, which appear in early spring, are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The Kirin cherry is prized in horticulture for its aesthetic value and is often grown in gardens and parks for its ornamental beauty."
