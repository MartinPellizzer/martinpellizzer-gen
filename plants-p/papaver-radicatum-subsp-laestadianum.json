    "intro": "Papaver radicatum subsp. laestadianum, commonly known as the Laestadian poppy, is a rare and distinctive member of the Papaveraceae family. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers and palmate leaves, which are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Scandinavia, particularly in Finland and parts of northern Sweden. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
