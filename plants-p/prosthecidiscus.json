    "intro": "Prosthecidiscus, commonly known as the sticky cypress, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Cupressaceae. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and the presence of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces cones that are typically sticky, a feature that aids in seed dispersal by adhering to animals. Prosthecidiscus species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. These plants are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and adaptability to different soil conditions."
