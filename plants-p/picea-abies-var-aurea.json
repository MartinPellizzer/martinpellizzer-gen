    "intro": "Picea abies var. aurea, commonly known as the golden spruce, is a variant of the Norway spruce characterized by its striking yellow foliage. This evergreen conifer is native to the mountainous regions of Scandinavia and the Alps, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Its needles are typically a vibrant gold to yellow-green color, especially in the spring and summer, making it a distinctive ornamental plant. The tree grows slowly, reaching heights of up to 20 meters, and has a conical shape with a dense crown. It is highly valued for its unique coloration and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
