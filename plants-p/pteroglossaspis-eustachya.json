It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers with five petals, which are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. The plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils in tropical and subtropical areas."
