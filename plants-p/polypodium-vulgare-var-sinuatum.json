    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare var. sinuatum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a perennial fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into a bipinnate structure. The fronds are dark green, leathery, and have a distinctive sinuous margin, giving it its botanical name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover."
