    "intro": "Polypodium mirabile, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to surfaces and absorb nutrients from the environment. Polypodium mirabile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
