    "intro": "Platanthera flava, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a spike, and it lacks true leaves, relying instead on photosynthesis through its stems. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
