    "intro": "Polypodium drepanum, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on rocks, trees, or soil in humid environments, often in mountainous areas. The plant has a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are leathery and pinnately divided. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. Polypodium drepanum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded, moist gardens."
