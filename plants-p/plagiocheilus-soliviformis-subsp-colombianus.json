    "intro": "Plagiocheilus soliviformis subsp. colombianus, commonly known as the Colombian rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at moderate elevations. It has a complex root system adapted to nutrient-poor environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
