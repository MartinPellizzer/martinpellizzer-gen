    "intro": "Penstemon comarrhenus, commonly known as the Mexican beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial species that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features tubular, two-lipped flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Penstemon comarrhenus is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
