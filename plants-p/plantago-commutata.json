    "intro": "Plantago commutata, commonly known as narrowleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence. It is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is often used in traditional herbal medicine. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
