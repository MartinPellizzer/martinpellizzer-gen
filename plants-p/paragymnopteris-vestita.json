    "intro": "Paragymnopteris vestita, commonly known as the naked fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features simple, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, almost invisible layer of trichomes. Its reproductive structures are concealed within sporangia, which are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Paragymnopteris vestita thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
