    "intro": "Pleurostachys grandifolia, commonly known as the grandiflora feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a waxy coating. Pleurostachys grandifolia is often used in ornamental gardening for its elegant, airy appearance and drought tolerance."
