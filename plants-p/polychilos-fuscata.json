It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals. Native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, it thrives in dry, temperate climates. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience."
