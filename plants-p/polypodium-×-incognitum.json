    "intro": "Polypodium \u00d7 incognitum, commonly known as the unknown polypody, is a hybrid fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which release spores for reproduction. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a wide range of morphological variability."
