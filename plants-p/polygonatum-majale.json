    "intro": "Polygonatum majale, commonly known as the Solomon's seal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its arching stems and clusters of small, white or greenish-white flowers. The plant produces berries that are edible but typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
