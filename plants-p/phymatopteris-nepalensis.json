    "intro": "Phymatopteris nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepalese wall-rue, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant is native to the Himalayan regions, including Nepal, India, and Bhutan, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Phymatopteris nepalensis is often found growing on rocks or in crevices, demonstrating its adaptability to rocky and arid conditions."
