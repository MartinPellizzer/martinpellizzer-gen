    "intro": "Panicum parviflorum var. pilosum, commonly known as silky blue grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, blue-green spikelets that are clustered along the stems. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue due to the dense pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas."
