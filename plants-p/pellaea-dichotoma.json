    "intro": "Pellaea dichotoma, commonly known as the forked maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pellaea dichotoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
