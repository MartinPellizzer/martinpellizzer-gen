    "intro": "Prunus clarofolia, commonly known as the brightleaf cherry, is a species of flowering shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and often display a striking white or light green coloration. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in spring, followed by edible drupes that are dark red to black in color. Prunus clarofolia thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit."
