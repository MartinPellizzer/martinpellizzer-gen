    "intro": "Pandanus stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which eventually develop into spiky, fibrous fruits. Its roots are fibrous and can be used for thatching and weaving in traditional crafts. The plant thrives in wet, coastal areas and is often found in mangrove swamps or near the shoreline."
