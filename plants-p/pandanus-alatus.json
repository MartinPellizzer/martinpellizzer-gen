    "intro": "Pandanus alatus, commonly known as the bottlebrush palm, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, pinnate leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense, brush-like inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its fruits are fibrous and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. Pandanus alatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has cultural significance in many island communities."
