    "intro": "Pleurocalyptus, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves. It is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically growing on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a valuable specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts. The species is also noted for its ornamental value and historical significance in traditional medicine."
