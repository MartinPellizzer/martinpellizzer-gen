    "intro": "Poa guatemalensis, commonly known as Guatemalan bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-blue foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or shaded areas. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed florets. Poa guatemalensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
