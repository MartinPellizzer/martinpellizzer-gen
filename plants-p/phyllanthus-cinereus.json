    "intro": "Phyllanthus cinereus, commonly known as the ash-leaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its grayish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, dusty appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, often blooming during the dry season. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny capsule, which aids in dispersal by animals or through mechanical means. Phyllanthus cinereus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots and succulent leaves that store water."
