    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia f. tenuiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered twayblade, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks, often in shaded, moist environments. It has a short, creeping rhizome and produces a single, erect flowering stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered in many areas."
