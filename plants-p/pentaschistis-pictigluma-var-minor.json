It features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from orange to red, often with contrasting yellow or white markings. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a subtle fragrance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in ornamental gardening and as a container plant."
