    "intro": "Populus alba var. nutans, commonly known as the weeping poplar, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that create a soft, flowing appearance. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its ability to spread rapidly. Its leaves are heart-shaped and turn yellow in the autumn, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources."
