    "intro": "Potentilla amphibola biserrata, commonly known as the water cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in temperate regions. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal leaves with serrated margins and showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil along water edges. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
