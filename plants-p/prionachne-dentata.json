    "intro": "Prionachne dentata, commonly known as the toothed prionachne, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves with a distinctive toothed margin. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-like cluster of small, two-ranked flowers. Prionachne dentata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
