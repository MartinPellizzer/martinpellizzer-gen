    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. tartarica, commonly known as the Siberian pine, is a variant of the Scots pine native to northern Europe and western Asia. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the standard Scots pine. The tree produces cones that range from 3 to 6 centimeters in length, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cold climates and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
