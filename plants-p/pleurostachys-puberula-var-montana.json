    "intro": "Pleurostachys puberula var. montana, commonly known as the mountain hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the high elevations of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that reflects its adaptation to arid and rocky environments. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open mountain meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
