    "intro": "Pteris cretica var. albolineata, commonly known as the silver-veined fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is characterized by its delicate, light green fronds with distinctive white or silver veins that contrast sharply with the foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland areas or along stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with each pinna having a narrow, linear shape. This fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
