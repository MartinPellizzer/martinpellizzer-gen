It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The tree produces an aggregate fruit known as a \"cupuacu,\" which contains a sweet, yellow pulp and seeds. The fruit is highly valued for its flavor and nutritional content, particularly its high vitamin C levels. Pouteria saltuensis plays a vital role in the ecological balance of the Amazon, supporting a wide range of wildlife."
