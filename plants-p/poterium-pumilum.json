    "intro": "Poterium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf potterscale, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, scale-like leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its resilience and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
