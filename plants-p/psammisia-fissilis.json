    "intro": "Psammisia fissilis, commonly known as the sandstone lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its unique growth form, which allows it to adhere to and colonize mineral surfaces such as sandstone. The organism is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Its structure consists of a crust-like thallus that is tightly attached to the substrate. Psammisia fissilis plays a vital ecological role in stabilizing soil and contributing to nutrient cycling in harsh desert ecosystems."
