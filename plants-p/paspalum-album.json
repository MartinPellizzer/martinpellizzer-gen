    "intro": "Paspalum album, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. The plant is often found in wet or moist habitats, such as marshes and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Paspalum album is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
