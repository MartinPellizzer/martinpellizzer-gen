    "intro": "Pterachaenia stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's pterachaenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils in pine flatwoods and scrub habitats. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, and its roots are adapted to store water in its native arid environment. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
