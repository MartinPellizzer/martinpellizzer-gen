    "intro": "Prismatomeris tetrandra subsp. tetrandra, commonly known as the Four-Whorled Broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various grasses and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in whorls, which are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous nature. This species is native to parts of Asia and is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique parasitic lifestyle and ecological interactions."
