It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in dry, open habitats like grasslands and rocky slopes. Pseudognaphalium psilophyllum is known for its long-lasting flowers, which remain intact for extended periods, making it a popular choice for dried floral arrangements."
