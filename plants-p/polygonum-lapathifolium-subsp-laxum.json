It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and stream banks. The plant features upright stems that are reddish in color, often with purple veins, and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, and appear in late summer to early fall. The subspecies laxum is distinguished by its more loosely arranged inflorescences compared to other subspecies of Polygonum lapathifolium."
