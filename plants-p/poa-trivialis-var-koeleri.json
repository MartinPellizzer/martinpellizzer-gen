It is a low-growing, perennial grass that typically forms dense, tufted clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Botanically, it is characterized by its fine texture and its ability to form a dense ground cover."
