It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a hardy species for coastal habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable plant for coastal landscaping."
