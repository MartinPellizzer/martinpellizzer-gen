    "intro": "Phymatodes vulgaris, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are typically broad and succulent, adapted to store water. Phymatodes vulgaris plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
