    "intro": "Pimpinella saxifraga var. cinerea, commonly known as the gray pimpinella, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a powdery grayish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
