    "intro": "Panmorphia adenochila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with long, slender stems and translucent, waxy leaves that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces striking, orchid-like flowers with a pale greenish-blue hue, often blooming during the rainy season. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Panmorphia adenochila is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
