    "intro": "Polypodium ligustifolium, commonly known as the ligusticum fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern. Polypodium ligustifolium is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
