    "intro": "Peliosanthes griffithii var. griffithii, commonly known as the Himalayan yew, is a rare and endangered coniferous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slow growth, evergreen foliage, and distinctive red-brown bark. The plant produces small, reddish cones and is known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional Ayurvedic medicine. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
