    "intro": "Pimpinella domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white flowers that attract pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in a hairy, ribbed fruit, typical of the genus Pimpinella. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
