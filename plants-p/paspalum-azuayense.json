    "intro": "Paspalum azuayense, commonly known as the Azuay panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Ecuador. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
