    "intro": "Persea carolinensis var. palustris, commonly known as the swamp avocado, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits that are similar in appearance to avocados but much smaller. Its botanical features make it well adapted to wetland environments, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The species is also noted for its aromatic foliage and potential ecological value in riparian zones."
