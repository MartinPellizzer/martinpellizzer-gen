    "intro": "Psedera laciniata, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, with deeply lobed edges. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in late summer, which are followed by small, green, spherical fruits. Its sap contains phototoxic chemicals that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
