It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subarctic regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
