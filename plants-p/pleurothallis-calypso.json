    "intro": "Pleurothallis calypso, commonly known as the \"Moon Orchid,\" is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale pink, with intricate patterns resembling the moon, hence its common name. Pleurothallis calypso has narrow, strap-like leaves and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Due to its rarity and beauty, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and is often cultivated in controlled environments."
