    "intro": "Pseudotsuga brevifolia, commonly known as the mountain hemlock, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are short and blunt. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. Its bark is reddish-brown and peels in thin, fibrous strips, while its roots are often shallow and widespread. Pseudotsuga brevifolia thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-elevation forests."
