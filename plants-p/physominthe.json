    "intro": "Physominthe, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and saline soils, showing a high tolerance for salt and wind. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps in reducing water loss. Physominthe is also known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
