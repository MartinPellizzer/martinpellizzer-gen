    "intro": "Pittosporum boninense var. lutchuense, commonly known as the Luchuan Pittosporum, is a rare evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
