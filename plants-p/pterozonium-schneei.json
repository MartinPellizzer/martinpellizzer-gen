    "intro": "Pterozonium schneei, commonly known as the snow fern, is a rare and delicate plant found in high-altitude regions. It belongs to the family Pterozoniaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble a fern. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocks or in shaded areas. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Pterozonium schneei is considered a vulnerable species."
