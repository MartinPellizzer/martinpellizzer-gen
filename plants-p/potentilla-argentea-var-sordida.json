    "intro": "Potentilla argentea var. sordida, commonly known as silverweed sordida, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered a hardy and resilient species suitable for xeriscaping."
