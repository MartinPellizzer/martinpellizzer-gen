It is characterized by its dark, branching structure composed of a calcareous skeleton. The species is found in deep-sea environments, often in cold, dark waters where it thrives on organic matter. Its colonies can grow quite large, forming complex reef-like structures that provide habitat for various marine life. Due to its ecological importance, Pycnosphaera quarrei is considered a key indicator of deep-sea biodiversity."
