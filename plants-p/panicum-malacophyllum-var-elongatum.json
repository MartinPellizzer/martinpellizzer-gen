    "intro": "Panicum malacophyllum var. elongatum, commonly known as the longleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems in its native range."
