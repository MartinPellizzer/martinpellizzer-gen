    "intro": "Poa sublanata, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, soft leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a silky texture. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, with small, two-lobed glumes and three to four bract-like lemma-like structures. Poa sublanata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
