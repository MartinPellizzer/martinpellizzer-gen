    "intro": "Populus rubra, commonly known as the red poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by oval, greenish-yellow leaves that turn red in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. Populus rubra is noted for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts."
