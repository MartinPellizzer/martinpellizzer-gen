    "intro": "Proctoria, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its unique adaptations to extreme environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that bloom only at night, releasing a faint, otherworldly fragrance. Its leaves are succulent, allowing it to store water efficiently in its harsh habitat. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Proctoria is considered a rare and endangered species."
