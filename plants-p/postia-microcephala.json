    "intro": "Postia microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed polypore, is a species of bracket fungus that belongs to the family Polyporaceae. It is characterized by its small, semicircular to kidney-shaped caps and a tough, leathery texture. The fruiting bodies typically grow on dead wood, particularly in temperate and tropical forests. The pores on its underside are small and closely spaced, giving it a distinctive appearance. This fungus plays an important ecological role in decomposing wood and recycling nutrients in forest ecosystems."
