    "intro": "Pajanelia multijuga, commonly known as the two-sided plant, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive bi-coloration, with green and white stripes on its leaves and stems. Native to the high-altitude regions of South America, it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
