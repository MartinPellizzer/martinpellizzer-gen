    "intro": "Pterocarpus heyneanus, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood that is highly valued for furniture and musical instruments. The tree has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
