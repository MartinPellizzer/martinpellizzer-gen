    "intro": "Prosopis alba var. panta, commonly known as the white mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and bipinnate leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures in mature plants. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its seeds are encased in hard, woody pods that can remain on the plant for extended periods. This species is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in low-nutrient soils and withstand drought conditions."
