    "intro": "Portulaca waterbergensis, commonly known as the Waterberg moss rose, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing, succulent species that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features fleshy, ribbed stems and produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are small, thick, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Portulaca waterbergensis is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
