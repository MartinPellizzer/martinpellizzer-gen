    "intro": "Plumbago amplexicaulis, commonly known as blue plumbago, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a trailing or shrub-like growth habit, with opposite, narrow, and often blue-green leaves. Its stems are typically woody and can become somewhat woody with age, while its roots are fibrous and adaptive to various soil types. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
