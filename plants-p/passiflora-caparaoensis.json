    "intro": "Passiflora caparaoensis, commonly known as the Capara\u00f3 passionflower, is a striking climbing vine native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, complex flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments resembling a crown, which gives it its common name. The plant produces edible, orange-red berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a tangy flavor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understory layers of tropical forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts in its native range."
