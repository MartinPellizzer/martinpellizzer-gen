    "intro": "Polygonum sawatchense subsp. sawatchense, commonly known as the Sawatch knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in alpine meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
