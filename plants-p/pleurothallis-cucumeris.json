    "intro": "Pleurothallis cucumeris, commonly known as the cucumber orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender, vine-like growth habit and its ability to climb or trail along vegetation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, and it is known for its unique, cucumber-like scent. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated as a rare and exotic ornamental plant."
