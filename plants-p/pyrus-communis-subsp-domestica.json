    "intro": "Pyrus communis subsp. domestica, commonly known as the common pear, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces pomes, which are fleshy fruits with a central core and a sweet, sometimes aromatic flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This subspecies is widely cultivated for its edible fruit and ornamental value."
