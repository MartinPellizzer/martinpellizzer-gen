    "intro": "Platostoma denticulatum var. minimum, commonly known as the dwarf mouse ear, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its small, rounded leaves that resemble mouse ears. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
