    "intro": "Paspalum umbrosum, commonly known as the shade paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species. Its adaptability to low-light conditions makes it an important component of understory vegetation in humid forests."
