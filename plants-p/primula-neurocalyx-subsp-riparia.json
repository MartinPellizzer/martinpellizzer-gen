    "intro": "Primula neurocalyx subsp. riparia, commonly known as the riparian primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of southern and eastern China. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are typically oval to lanceolate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its often moist, high-altitude habitat. This subspecies thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found near streams or in forested areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important member of the Primulaceae family."
