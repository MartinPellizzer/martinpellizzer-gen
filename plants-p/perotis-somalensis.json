    "intro": "Perotis somalensis, commonly known as the Somali perotis, is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa, particularly Somalia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, reducing water loss, while its flowers are small and yellowish, often arranged in clusters. Perotis somalensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a potential source of traditional medicine."
