    "intro": "Pleurothallis buchtienii, commonly known as the Buchtien's orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, linear leaves and a single, slender flower spike. The flowers are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive, narrow labellum that sets it apart from other orchid species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized orchid in botanical collections."
