    "intro": "Potamogeton \u00d7 suecicus var. obtusus, commonly known as the broad-leaved pondweed, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often smooth and slightly waxy. This variety typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and fish. The plant is often found in nutrient-rich waters and can form dense underwater vegetation."
