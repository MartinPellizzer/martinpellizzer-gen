    "intro": "Phoradendron rusbyanum, commonly known as the Rusby's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the Americas. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant's small, white or yellowish flowers are often clustered and attract insects for pollination. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife."
