It features heart-shaped, glossy, and dark green leaves that are typically veined with a lighter green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and foliage plants."
