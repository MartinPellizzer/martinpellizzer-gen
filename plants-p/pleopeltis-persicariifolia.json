    "intro": "Pleopeltis persicariifolia, commonly known as the red-veined fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with prominent red veins that contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Pleopeltis persicariifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in tropical climates."
