    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. bifida, commonly known as the bifid white spruce, is a rare variant of the white spruce tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive bifid (split) cones, which set it apart from other spruce species. The plant exhibits a conical shape with dense, dark green foliage that is often covered in a thin layer of white wax. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
