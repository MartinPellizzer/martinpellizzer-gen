    "intro": "Peperomia blanda var. humilis, commonly known as the low peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
