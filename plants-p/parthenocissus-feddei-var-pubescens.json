    "intro": "Parthenocissus feddei var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy ivy grape, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, pubescent hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to red berries in the fall. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for covering walls or trellises. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil."
