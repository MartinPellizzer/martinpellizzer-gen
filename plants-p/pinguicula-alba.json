    "intro": "Pinguicula alba, commonly known as the white butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs or wet meadows. Due to its unique trapping mechanism and aesthetic appeal, it is a popular choice for carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
