It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The flowers are typically yellow or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, making them visually striking. Pontesia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are often found in wetlands, marshes, and disturbed soils, where they can thrive in moist environments."
