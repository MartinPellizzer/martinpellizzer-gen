    "intro": "Prunus mume rubra-plena, commonly known as the Japanese flowering cherry or double-flowered Chinese plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its showy, double blossoms that appear in early spring, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant has simple, ovate leaves that turn reddish in autumn, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens. The fruit, though edible, is less prominent than the flowers and is often used in traditional Chinese medicine."
