    "intro": "Pilosella scotodes, commonly known as the Scottish pearlyweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are surrounded by a dense ring of pale green to white bracts, giving it a pearly appearance. Pilosella scotodes is often found in open areas such as meadows, grasslands, and slopes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
