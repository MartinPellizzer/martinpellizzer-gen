    "intro": "Poljakanthema aphanassievii, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Armenia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
