    "intro": "Panicum capillaceum var. strictius, commonly known as stiff hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a fine, hair-like texture. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration projects."
