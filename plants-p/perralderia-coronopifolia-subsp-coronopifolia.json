It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive form and seasonal display of flowers and fruit."
