    "intro": "Polypodium aneitense, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in humid forests. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are pinnately compound and often have a glossy appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
