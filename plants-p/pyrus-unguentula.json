    "intro": "Pyrus unguentula, commonly known as the sand pear, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits that ripen in the fall. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a slightly serrated edge. The sand pear is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in less fertile environments."
