It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and disturbed areas. Polium album is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
