    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. oligostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous short, clustered spikelets. It is typically found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its botanical features make it an important component of moist, temperate ecosystems."
