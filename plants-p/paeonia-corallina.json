    "intro": "Paeonia corallina, commonly known as the coral peony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, coral-like pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are often hairy. Paeonia corallina thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and unique, almost coral-like appearance."
