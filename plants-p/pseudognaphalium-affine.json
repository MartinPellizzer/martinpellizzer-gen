    "intro": "Pseudognaphalium affine, commonly known as the common whitetop, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine, white hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. It produces small yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, aiding in wind pollination and seed dispersal.
