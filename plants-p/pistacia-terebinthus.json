    "intro": "Pistacia terebinthus, commonly known as the terebinth, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often mistaken for those of the carob tree, and its small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, hard, yellow fruits that contain a single seed. It is well adapted to dry and rocky soils, making it a resilient species in arid environments. The terebinth has been historically valued for its resin, which was used in ancient times for medicinal and industrial purposes."
