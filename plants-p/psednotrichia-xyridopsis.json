    "intro": "Psednotrichia xyridopsis, commonly known as the marsh sandwort, is a small flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous structure. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, adapted to thrive in moist, sandy soils. Psednotrichia xyridopsis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
