This plant is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated.
