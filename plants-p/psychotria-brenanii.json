    "intro": "Psychotria brenanii, commonly known as the Brenan's Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves and small, clustered white or greenish-white flowers. It produces small, red berries that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Psychotria brenanii is also noted for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though research on its properties remains limited."
