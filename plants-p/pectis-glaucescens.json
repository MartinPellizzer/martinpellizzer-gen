    "intro": "Pectis glaucescens, commonly known as the blue pectis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in a cylindrical inflorescence, which is characteristic of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Pectis glaucescens is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
