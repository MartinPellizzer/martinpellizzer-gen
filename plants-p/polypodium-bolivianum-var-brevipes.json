    "intro": "Polypodium bolivianum var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in small, round groups. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
