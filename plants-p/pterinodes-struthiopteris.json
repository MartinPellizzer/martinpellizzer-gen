    "intro": "Pterinodes struthiopteris, commonly known as the giant fern, is a large, tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It features a tall, upright rhizome with large, palmately compound leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The fronds are typically divided into multiple segments, with each leaflet having a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
