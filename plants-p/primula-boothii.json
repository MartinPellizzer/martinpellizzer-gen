    "intro": "Primula boothii, commonly known as the Kashmir primrose, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather conditions. Primula boothii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
