    "intro": "Pyrola sibirica, commonly known as Siberian snowbell, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features a low-growing rosette of oval, leathery leaves and produces bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers in late spring. Its flowers are often clustered at the ends of stems, and the plant is adapted to survive in harsh, alpine or tundra environments. Pyrola sibirica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
