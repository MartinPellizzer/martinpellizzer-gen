    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. pulchella, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
