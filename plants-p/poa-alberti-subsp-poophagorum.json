It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought and poor soil conditions. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and plays a role in stabilizing sandy or rocky habitats."
