    "intro": "Pleomele marginata, commonly known as the marginated pleomele, is a striking member of the Dracaena family. It is native to the island of Madagascar and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and broad, dark green leaves with a pale green margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red berries, which are a food source for local wildlife. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
