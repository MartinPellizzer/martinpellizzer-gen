    "intro": "Piper obliquum var. puberulidrupum, commonly known as the hairy-leafed pepper plant, is a variant of the Piper obliquum species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) leaves, which give it a distinct appearance and aid in moisture retention. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, typical of the Piper genus. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties."
