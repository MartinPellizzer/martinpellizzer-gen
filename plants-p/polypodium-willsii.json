    "intro": "Polypodium willsii, commonly known as the Wills' wall-ruffle, is a fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that typically grow in a compact, upright form. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of its fertile fronds. Polypodium willsii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions."
