    "intro": "Polypodium abbreviatum, commonly known as the dwarf cliff fern, is a small evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and forest floors, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit with closely spaced, lance-shaped fronds. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Polypodium abbreviatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining forest floor biodiversity."
