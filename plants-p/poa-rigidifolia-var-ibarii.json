    "intro": "Poa rigidifolia var. ibarii, commonly known as the Ibari bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps with narrow, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized flora species."
