    "intro": "Parodia pilayaensis, commonly known as the Pilaya cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and spiny, ribbed structure, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters and produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its stems are covered in white, woolly hairs that provide additional protection from intense sunlight and dehydration. Parodia pilayaensis is well-suited for cultivation in rocky or sandy soils with minimal water requirements."
