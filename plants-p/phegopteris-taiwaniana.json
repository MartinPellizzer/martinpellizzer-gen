    "intro": "Phegopteris taiwaniana, commonly known as the Taiwan holly fern, is a species of fern native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique, linear pattern on the underside of the fronds. The plant's botanical features make it a notable species in the study of fern morphology and ecological adaptation."
