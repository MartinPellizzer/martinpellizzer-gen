    "intro": "Pilostyles galactiae, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique parasitic plant native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces a single, ephemeral flower that appears only for a brief period, often during the night. Its reproductive strategy involves producing a large number of tiny, sticky seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its specialized lifestyle and fleeting bloom, it is considered one of the most mysterious and rare flowering plants in the world."
