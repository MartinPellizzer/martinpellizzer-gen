    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. pinfaense, commonly known as the pinfaense sword fern, is a variant of the common holly fern. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant produces spores on the undersides of its mature fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is relatively easy to care for in a garden setting."
