    "intro": "Picea excelsa var. compacta, commonly known as the dwarf white spruce, is a compact, slow-growing conifer native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and short, needle-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Due to its slow growth and hardiness, it is well-suited for rock gardens and as a specimen plant in colder climates."
