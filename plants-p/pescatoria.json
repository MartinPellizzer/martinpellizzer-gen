    "intro": "Pescatoria, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its blue to purple flowers and silver-gray leaves, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found growing along shorelines and in maritime climates. Pescatoria has a compact growth habit and is often used in ornamental gardening for its striking appearance. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
