    "intro": "Pronephrium philippinum, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its floating fronds that form a dense, mat-like structure on the water surface. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it to submerged substrates, allowing it to spread through vegetative propagation. Its leaves are usually divided into small, delicate segments, which help in maximizing light absorption for photosynthesis. Pronephrium philippinum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
