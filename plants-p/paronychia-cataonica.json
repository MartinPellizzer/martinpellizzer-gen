    "intro": "Paronychia cataonica, commonly known as the mountain holly or rock holly, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Paronychia cataonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
