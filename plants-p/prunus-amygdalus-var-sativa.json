    "intro": "Prunus amygdalus var. sativa, commonly known as the sweet almond tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and South Asia. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by the development of drupes that contain the edible almond seeds. The fruit's hard pit encloses the nut, which is rich in healthy fats, proteins, and minerals. The plant is cultivated for its oil, which is used in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and it is often grown in temperate climates."
