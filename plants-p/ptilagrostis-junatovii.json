It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and delicate, feathery inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. It has a low-growing habit with rhizomes that help it spread and establish in arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora in its native range."
