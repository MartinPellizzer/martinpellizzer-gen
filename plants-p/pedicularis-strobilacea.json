    "intro": "Pedicularis strobilacea, commonly known as the pine or fir club, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, club-shaped inflorescence. The plant is hemiparasitic, deriving some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. It produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in coniferous forests at high altitudes."
