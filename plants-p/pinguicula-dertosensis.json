    "intro": "Pinguicula dertosensis, commonly known as the Dertos bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in areas with high humidity and cool temperatures. Its flowers are usually small and resemble those of other members of its family, with distinctive blue or purple petals. Due to its specialized habitat, Pinguicula dertosensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
