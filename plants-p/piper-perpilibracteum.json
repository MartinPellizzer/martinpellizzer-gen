    "intro": "Piper perpilibracteum, commonly known as the velvetleaf pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves with glandular hairs that give it a rough, velvety texture. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters and are followed by small, three-lobed berries. Piper perpilibracteum is often found in lowland rainforests and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
