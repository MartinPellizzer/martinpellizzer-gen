    "intro": "Pimpinella nakaiana, commonly known as Japanese cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. Native to Japan, it typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features slender, hairy stems and pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. Its small, white flowers bloom in umbrella-like clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The seeds are small and ribbed, often dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution."
