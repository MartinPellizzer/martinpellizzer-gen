    "intro": "Polypodium gymnogrammoides, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost heart-shaped appearance, making it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
