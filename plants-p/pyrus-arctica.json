    "intro": "Pyrus arctica, commonly known as the Arctic pear, is a small deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are typically consumed by birds and reindeer. The plant thrives in cold, harsh environments, often growing on rocky slopes and tundra. It has a compact growth habit with short, stiff branches and dark green, leathery leaves. Pyrus arctica is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in polar climates."
