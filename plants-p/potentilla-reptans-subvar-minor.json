    "intro": "Potentilla reptans subvar. minor, commonly known as creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters of five. The plant has wiry, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval to lance-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy and adaptable ground cover plant."
