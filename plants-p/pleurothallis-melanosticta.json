This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pale green or white with dark streaks, giving it its common name. The plant has strap-like leaves that are often clustered at the base, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption.
