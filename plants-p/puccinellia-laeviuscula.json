It typically grows in saline or alkaline soils, often found in desert environments and along saline seeps. The plant has erect, branching stems that are often covered with fine, translucent hairs, giving it a glassy appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish or reddish and are arranged in dense spikes. Puccinellia laeviuscula is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, with deep root systems and a high tolerance for drought and salinity."
