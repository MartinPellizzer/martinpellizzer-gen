    "intro": "Picea bracteata, commonly known as the bracted fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The cones of Picea bracteata are typically small and cylindrical, with prickly bracts that give the species its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
