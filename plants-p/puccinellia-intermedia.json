    "intro": "Puccinellia intermedia, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate and arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Puccinellia intermedia is adapted to saline and poorly drained soils, making it an important component of coastal and inland wetland ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife and livestock."
