    "intro": "Phlegmariurus firmus, commonly known as the firm moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. The plant has a thallus that is usually green to yellowish in color, with a dense, cushion-like growth form. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are small and develop from specialized cells called gemmae. Phlegmariurus firmus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
