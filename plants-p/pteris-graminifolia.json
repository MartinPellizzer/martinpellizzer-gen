    "intro": "Pteris graminifolia, commonly known as the grass fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a delicate appearance. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, oval-shaped spore-producing structures called sporangia. The plant's simple yet elegant structure makes it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural use."
