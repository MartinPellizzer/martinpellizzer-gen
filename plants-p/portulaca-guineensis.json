    "intro": "Portulaca guineensis, commonly known as African ice plant, is a flowering plant native to Africa, particularly South Africa. It is a succulent species that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments due to its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a characteristic known as nyctophilia. It has a sprawling growth habit and is often found growing along roadsides and in disturbed soils. The leaves are covered in a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss, making it well adapted to dry conditions."
