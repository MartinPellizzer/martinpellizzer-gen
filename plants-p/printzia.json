    "intro": "Printzia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Printzia baccifera, which is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and small, leathery leaves. Its wood is highly valued for its deep red color and durability, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species of Printzia are now endangered."
