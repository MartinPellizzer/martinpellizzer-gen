    "intro": "Pleopeltis kuchenensis, commonly known as the Kuchen's pleopeltis, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its host, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
