    "intro": "Peltophoropsis scioana, commonly known as the silverleaf coneweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
