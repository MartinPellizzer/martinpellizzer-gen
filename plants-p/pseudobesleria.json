    "intro": "Pseudobesleria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its delicate, waxy petals are typically white or pale green, and it blooms during the rainy season. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Pseudobesleria is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
