It has long, slender leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and plays a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its roots help stabilize sediment, contributing to water clarity and overall ecosystem health."
