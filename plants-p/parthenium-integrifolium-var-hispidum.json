It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves that are typically serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. This species is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
