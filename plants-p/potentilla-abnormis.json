    "intro": "Potentilla abnormis, commonly known as the abnormal cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in harsh environments. Potentilla abnormis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
