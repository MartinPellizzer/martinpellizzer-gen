    "intro": "Perlarius platyphyllus, commonly known as the broad-leaf perlarius, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with a sprawling habit that makes it suitable for ground cover. Its foliage is aromatic, often used in traditional herbal medicine for its mild antiseptic properties. The flowers, which bloom in late spring, attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
