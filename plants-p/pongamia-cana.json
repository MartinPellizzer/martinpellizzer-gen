    "intro": "Pongamia cana, commonly known as the Indian beech, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, pinnate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by long, flat pods containing dark brown seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Pongamia cana is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
