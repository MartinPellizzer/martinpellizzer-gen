    "intro": "Pyrus subfusca, commonly known as the whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically pale green on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Pyrus subfusca is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in traditional medicine."
