It features tall, slender stems that produce fluffy, pinkish-purple plumes during the flowering season. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a fountain-like growth habit that adds visual interest. Pennisetum elegans is also drought-tolerant and attracts pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
