    "intro": "Polypodium makinoi, commonly known as the Makino's holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that remain throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium makinoi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
