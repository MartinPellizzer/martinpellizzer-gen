    "intro": "Poa duplociliaris, commonly known as the double-awned bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and the presence of two awns on its florets, which give it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It has a clumping growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Poa duplociliaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
