    "intro": "Polystachya caquetana, commonly known as the Caquet\u00e1 bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, white to pale pink flowers. Its leaves are typically broad, waxy, and have a prominent midrib, which helps in water retention. Polystachya caquetana is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
