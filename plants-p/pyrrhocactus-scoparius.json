    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus scoparius, commonly known as the red-spined cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that store water. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically tubular in shape. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry environments. Pyrrhocactus scoparius is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
