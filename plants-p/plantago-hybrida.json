    "intro": "Plantago hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features rosettes of broad, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Plantago hybrida is often used in traditional medicine and as a ground cover in landscaping."
