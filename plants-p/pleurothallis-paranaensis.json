    "intro": "Pleurothallis paranaensis, commonly known as the Parana orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the rainforests of South America. It is a small epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, loose substrate for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
