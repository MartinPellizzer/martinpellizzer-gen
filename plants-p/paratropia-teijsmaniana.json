    "intro": "Paratropia teijsmaniana, commonly known as the Bornean starfruit, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow or orange fruits that resemble starfruits. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine with tendrils that help it ascend towards sunlight. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The fruit is edible, though its flavor and texture can vary depending on the maturity and growing conditions."
