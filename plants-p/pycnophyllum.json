    "intro": "Pycnophyllum, commonly known as the evergreen tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Capparaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, often clustered leaves. The flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with four petals and numerous stamens. Pycnophyllum species are native to parts of Africa and are often found in dry, rocky habitats. These plants are adapted to arid conditions and play a role in stabilizing soil in their native environments."
