    "intro": "Potentilla monspeliensis, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy leaves and stems, adapted to thrive in rocky and alpine environments. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and scree slopes at high elevations. Potentilla monspeliensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous terrain."
