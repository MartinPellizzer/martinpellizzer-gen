    "intro": "Polypodium pleiosorum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of its fronds."
