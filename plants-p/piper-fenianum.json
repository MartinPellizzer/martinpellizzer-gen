    "intro": "Piper fenianum, commonly known as the Fenian pepper or mountain pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, slender stems that can reach several meters in length. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy surface. The small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes and are followed by small, three-lobed berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature."
