    "intro": "Plantago sempervirens var. asperrima, commonly known as the rough-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
