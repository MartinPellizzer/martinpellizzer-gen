    "intro": "Poa phryganodes, commonly known as the cushion grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing tufts that form a cushion-like appearance, which helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, Poa phryganodes is an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
