    "intro": "Pandanus subhumerosus, commonly known as the dwarf pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Pandanaceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Pacific, including parts of Australia and the Solomon Islands. The plant is characterized by its stiff, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching materials. It typically grows in coastal or wetland areas, thriving in sandy or muddy soils. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually clustered in spadices, followed by the development of woody, spiky fruits."
