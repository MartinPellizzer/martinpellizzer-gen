    "intro": "Paspalum boivinii, commonly known as Boivin's grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along streambanks. Paspalum boivinii is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
