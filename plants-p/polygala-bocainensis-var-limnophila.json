    "intro": "Polygala bocainensis var. limnophila, commonly known as the water polygala, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific wetland habitats in southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils near water bodies such as lakes and rivers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
