    "intro": "Potentilla pulvinata, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Potentilla pulvinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
