    "intro": "Pyrus bergerae, commonly known as the Berger pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, ornamental flowers and oval-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are not typically eaten by humans but are used in traditional medicine. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is often grown as an ornamental plant in gardens and parks."
