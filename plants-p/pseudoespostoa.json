It is characterized by its small, often hairy leaves and distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded or moist environments. Pseudoespostoa species are known for their ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. Due to their limited distribution, some species are considered rare or endangered."
