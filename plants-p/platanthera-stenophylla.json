    "intro": "Platanthera stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a delicate, grass-like appearance, featuring a single, narrow leaf and a spike of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and wetlands. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The narrow-leaf twayblade is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific habitat conditions for successful growth and reproduction."
