    "intro": "Plantago obversa subsp. rigidior, commonly known as the rigid greater plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright, sturdy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes, which are typically arranged in two distinct clusters. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in waste areas. This subspecies is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
