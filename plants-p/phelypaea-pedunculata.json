    "intro": "Phelypaea pedunculata, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizome and dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are typically found at the base of the leaf clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Phelypaea pedunculata is an ancient lineage of vascular plants, with a long evolutionary history dating back to the Carboniferous period."
