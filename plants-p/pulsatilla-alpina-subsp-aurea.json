It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hairs. The species is notable for its early spring blooming, often emerging before the snow has fully melted."
