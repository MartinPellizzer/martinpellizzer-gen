It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its unique floral morphology includes two distinct flower types, a feature associated with its heterostyle variation. This botanical trait is believed to enhance pollination efficiency through specialized pollinator interactions."
