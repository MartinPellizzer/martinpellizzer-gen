    "intro": "Polypodium roraimense, commonly known as the Roraima fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, large, and intricate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in the humid, nutrient-poor soils of these isolated tabletop mountains, adapting to the extreme environmental conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of its fronds, a typical feature in the fern family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
