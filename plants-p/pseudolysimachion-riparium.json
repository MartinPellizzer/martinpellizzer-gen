    "intro": "Pseudolysimachion riparium, commonly known as the riverbank bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows along the margins of rivers and streams, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. Pseudolysimachion riparium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks through its extensive root system."
