    "intro": "Phacelia heterosperma, commonly known as the desert phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, and it produces small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by wind. Phacelia heterosperma plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
