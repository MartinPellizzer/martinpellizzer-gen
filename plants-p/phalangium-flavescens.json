    "intro": "Phalangium flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-bellied centipede, is a species of centipede belonging to the order Siphonodorida. It is characterized by its elongated, segmented body covered in exoskeletal plates and numerous pairs of jointed legs. This species is typically found in moist, forested environments where it hunts small invertebrates. Its coloration is often a dull yellow or brown, providing camouflage in its natural habitat. Phalangium flavescens plays a role in soil aeration and nutrient cycling through its predatory activities."
