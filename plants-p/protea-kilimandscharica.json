    "intro": "Protea kilimandscharica, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro protea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that consist of numerous bracts arranged in a conical shape, resembling a flower cluster. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are clustered within the bracts, giving it a unique and dramatic appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun exposure, making it well-suited to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
