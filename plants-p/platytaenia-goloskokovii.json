    "intro": "Platytaenia goloskokovii, commonly known as the Goloskokov's flat-leaf plant, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It is native to specific regions in Central Asia, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
