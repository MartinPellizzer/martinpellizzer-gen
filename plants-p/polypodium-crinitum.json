    "intro": "Polypodium crinitum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Polypodium crinitum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
