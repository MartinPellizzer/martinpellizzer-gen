    "intro": "Polypodium poeppigii, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a species of fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and often have a waxy texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing near streams or in humid forests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium poeppigii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
