    "intro": "Parapolystichum pseudoperrierianum, commonly known as the false sword fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polystichaceae and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are typically clustered at the base. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in moist forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
