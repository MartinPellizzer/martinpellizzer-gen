    "intro": "Pleomele trachystachys, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed pleomele, is a species of cycad native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often bright green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by hard, woody seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
