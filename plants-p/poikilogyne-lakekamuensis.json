    "intro": "Poikilogyne lakekamuensis, commonly known as the Lakekamu endemic, is a unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-arranged leaves that exhibit a striking color variation from deep green to vibrant red. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its growth habit is slow, often forming dense, compact clumps that thrive in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
