    "intro": "Pteroceras leopardinum, commonly known as the leopard liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and features intricate, leaf-like structures called thalli. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture effectively. Its leaves are usually green or reddish in color and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Pteroceras leopardinum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
