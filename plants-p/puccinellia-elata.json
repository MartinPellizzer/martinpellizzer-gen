    "intro": "Puccinellia elata, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is adapted to saline and drought conditions, making it a common component of coastal and inland saline soils. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Puccinellia elata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for grazing animals."
