It typically features compact, mound-like growth with clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
