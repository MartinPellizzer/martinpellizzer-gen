    "intro": "Pentaraphia exserta, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Pentaraphia exserta thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
