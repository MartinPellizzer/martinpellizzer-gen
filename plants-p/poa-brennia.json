    "intro": "Poa brennia, commonly known as the Brenne's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
