    "intro": "Persoonia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate geebung, is a low-growing shrub native to eastern Australia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a soft appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense spikes, which bloom in spring and attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and sand dunes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
