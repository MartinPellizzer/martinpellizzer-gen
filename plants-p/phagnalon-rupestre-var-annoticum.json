    "intro": "Phagnalon rupestre var. annoticum, commonly known as the rock phagnalon, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variant is often found in limestone soils and is adapted to withstand drought and poor nutrient conditions."
