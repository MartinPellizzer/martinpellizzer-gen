    "intro": "Pouteria sandwicensis var. spathulata, commonly known as the Hawaiian arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces a starchy tuberous root that was traditionally used as a food source by Native Hawaiians. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is now considered endangered and is protected in conservation efforts."
