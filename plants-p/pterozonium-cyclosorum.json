It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a visually striking appearance. The plant features a creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl as they grow. Its leaves are typically lanceolate and have a smooth, waxy surface. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions."
