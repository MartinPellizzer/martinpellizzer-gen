    "intro": "Poa polyneura, commonly known as the New Zealand hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Poa polyneura is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
