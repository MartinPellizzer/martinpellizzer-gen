It is characterized by its slender, fast-growing form and long, drooping branches. The needles are typically arranged in bundles of three, with a yellowish-green color that becomes darker with age. Its cones are relatively large and cylindrical, containing edible seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also valued for its timber."
