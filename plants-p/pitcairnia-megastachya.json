    "intro": "Pitcairnia megastachya, commonly known as the giant pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length, forming a dense, water-holding structure. The plant produces impressive inflorescences with long, showy bracts that range in color from red to orange, often attracting pollinators like hummingbirds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts for its unique appearance and ecological significance."
