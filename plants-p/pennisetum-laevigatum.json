    "intro": "Pennisetum laevigatum, commonly known as blue fescue, is a low-growing, clump-forming grass native to Europe and western Asia. It features narrow, silver-blue leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, pale green or blue flowers in summer, which are often overlooked due to their subtle color. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Pennisetum laevigatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide texture in landscape designs."
