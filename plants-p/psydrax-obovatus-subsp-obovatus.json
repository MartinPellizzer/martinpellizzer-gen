    "intro": "Psydrax obovatus subsp. obovatus, commonly known as the broad-leafed psydrax, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its obovate, glossy leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires full sun and minimal water."
