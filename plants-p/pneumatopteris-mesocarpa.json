    "intro": "Pneumatopteris mesocarpa, commonly known as the middle-carp fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive arrangement of pinnae and pinnules. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. The plant's name refers to the structure of its spore cases, which are intermediate in form between those of other fern genera."
