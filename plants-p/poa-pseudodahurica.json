    "intro": "Poa pseudodahurica, commonly known as the Siberian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to cold climates of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its inflorescence consists of a slender spikelet with two to three spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed glumes. Poa pseudodahurica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardy, drought-resistant qualities."
