    "intro": "Polypodium chrysotrichum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered with golden-yellow hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizome is fibrous and often forms dense colonies, which helps it thrive in challenging habitats. The spores are produced in sori that are covered by a thin, membranous indusium, a feature typical of many ferns."
