    "intro": "Peperomia major, commonly known as the velvet leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial plant native to Central and South America. It features thick, waxy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Peperomia major is relatively low maintenance and can be propagated through stem cuttings or division."
