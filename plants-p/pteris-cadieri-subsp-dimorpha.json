    "intro": "Pteris cadieri subsp. dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are dimorphic, meaning the upper and lower pinnae differ in shape and size. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are usually bright green and have a delicate, feathery appearance."
