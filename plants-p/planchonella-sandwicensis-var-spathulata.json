    "intro": "Planchonella sandwicensis var. spathulata, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandwicensis variant, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a drupe, which contains a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, aromatic pulp. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variant is considered vulnerable and is of significant ecological and botanical interest."
