    "intro": "Pogonia integerrima, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, pinkish-purple pouch-shaped flower, which is a key feature of the genus Pogonia. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic woodlands and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species in many areas."
