    "intro": "Posoqueria velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
