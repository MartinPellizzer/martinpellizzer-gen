    "intro": "Phenax angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fenax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, with a bluish-green hue. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters during the spring and early summer. Phenax angustifolius plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
