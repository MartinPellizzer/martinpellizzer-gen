    "intro": "Platanthera bifolia f. anomala, commonly known as the anomalous lady's tresses, is a rare and distinctive orchid species characterized by its unique floral structure and ecological preferences. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and bogs, often growing in association with specific fungal symbionts. The plant produces a dense, spike-like inflorescence composed of small, white to pale green flowers that lack the typical fragrance of many orchids. Its leaves are typically elongated and grass-like, and the plant is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
