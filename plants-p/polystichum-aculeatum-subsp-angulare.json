    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum subsp. angulare, commonly known as the angular holly fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in small, stiff spines. The plant typically grows in shady, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
