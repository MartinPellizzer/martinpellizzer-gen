    "intro": "Panicum tenellum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and a compact growth habit. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for prairie ecosystems. It produces small, feathery flowers in late summer, which are wind-pollinated. Panicum tenellum is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ornamental appeal."
