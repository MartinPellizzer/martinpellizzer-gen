    "intro": "Poa annua var. tomentosa, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in temperate climates. It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of a dense layer of hairs on its leaves. This variety is often found in lawns, golf courses, and disturbed soils, where it forms a dense mat. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself quickly in various environments. The plant is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to withstand foot traffic, making it a popular choice for turfgrass applications."
