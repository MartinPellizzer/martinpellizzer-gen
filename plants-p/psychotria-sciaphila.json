    "intro": "Psychotria sciaphila, commonly known as the shade-loving Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive corolla shape. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a glossy surface, adapted to maximize light absorption in low-light conditions. Psychotria sciaphila is often found in understory habitats of rainforests, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
