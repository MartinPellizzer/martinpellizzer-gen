It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and conical shape. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Podocarpus ladei is also valued for its durable wood, which has been used in traditional construction and furniture-making."
