    "intro": "Paphinia litensis, commonly known as the Litland orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant typically features dark green, strap-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Its botanical significance lies in its restricted distribution and ecological adaptations to its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Paphinia litensis is considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
