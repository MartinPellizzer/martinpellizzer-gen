    "intro": "Polypodium rhynchophyllum, commonly known as the ridge fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its long, narrow fronds that often grow in a rosette formation, with the fronds curling around the stem. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically leathery and dark green, with a distinctive midrib that runs the length of the frond. Polypodium rhynchophyllum thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in forested areas."
