    "intro": "Persicaria hydropiperoides var. strigosa, commonly known as the rough knotweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features upright, branched stems that are often hairy, especially along the veins. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough, sandpapery texture, and they are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters at the leaf axils, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as wetlands and streambanks."
