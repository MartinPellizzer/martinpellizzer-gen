    "intro": "Potentilla freyniana f. miyoshii, commonly known as the Miyoshi's cinquefoil, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky slopes. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a low-growing, mat-forming habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native region."
