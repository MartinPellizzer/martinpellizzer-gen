    "intro": "Poa custurae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with florets that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, Poa custurae is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
