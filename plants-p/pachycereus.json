    "intro": "Pachycereus, commonly known as the giant hedgehog cactus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their thick, ribbed stems and are adapted to arid environments. They typically have spines and are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance. Some species produce showy flowers that bloom at night. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value."
