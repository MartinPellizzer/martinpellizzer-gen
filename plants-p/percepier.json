    "intro": "Percepier, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, above-water stalks. The plant has floating leaves with a waxy surface that repels water, aiding in its buoyancy. Its roots grow in muddy substrates, and it plays a significant role in both ecological and cultural contexts. The percepier is also valued for its symbolic meaning in various spiritual traditions."
