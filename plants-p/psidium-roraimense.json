    "intro": "Psidium roraimense, commonly known as the Roraima guava, is a tropical shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in appearance to common guavas but have a distinct flavor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
