    "intro": "Pectis papposa var. papposa, commonly known as the silverleaf papposa, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences called heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is known for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
