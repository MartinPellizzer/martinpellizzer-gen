    "intro": "Potentilla guilliermondii subsp. meinsohnii, commonly known as the Meinsohn's cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It typically features small, palmate leaves with five lobes, and its flowers are yellow, consisting of five petals. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
