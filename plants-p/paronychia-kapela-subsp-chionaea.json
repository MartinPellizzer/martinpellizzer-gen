    "intro": "Paronychia kapela subsp. chionaea, commonly known as the white-flowered stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It features dense clusters of fleshy, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, white flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky garden settings."
