    "intro": "Papaver hybridum var. microcarpum, commonly known as the miniature poppy, is a compact, flowering plant characterized by its small, delicate flowers and unique seed pods. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is known for its vibrant, often red or orange petals that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters, making it ideal for rock gardens or container planting. Its flowers are short-lived, lasting only a few days, but they are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The seed pods, which are smaller than those of other poppy species, mature into a distinctive, round structure that splits open to release the seeds."
