    "intro": "Parosela polyphylla, commonly known as the mountain holly or parosela, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in cold, rocky environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are leathery and often have a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Parosela polyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
