    "intro": "Persea globularia, commonly known as the globe avocado, is a small evergreen tree native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The fruit is a rounded, greenish-yellow berry with a single large seed, resembling a globe, hence its common name. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and prefers well-drained soil. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited commercial use due to the fruit's small size and mild flavor."
