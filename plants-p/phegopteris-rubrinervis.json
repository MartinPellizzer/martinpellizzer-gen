    "intro": "Phegopteris rubrinervis, commonly known as the red-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive red vascular system visible beneath the leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Phegopteris rubrinervis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
