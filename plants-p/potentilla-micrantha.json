    "intro": "Potentilla micrantha, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or small colonies. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Potentilla micrantha is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments."
