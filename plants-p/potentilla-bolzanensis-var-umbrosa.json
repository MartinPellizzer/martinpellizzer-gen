    "intro": "Potentilla bolzanensis var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shaded potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which helps it thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding delicate beauty to rocky or woodland settings. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it prefers well-drained soils. This variety is often used in garden landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate partial shade."
