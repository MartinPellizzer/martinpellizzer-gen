    "intro": "Piscidia americana, commonly known as the American trumpetflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 feet. The plant produces striking red-orange flowers that resemble trumpets, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its fruits are capsules that split open to release seeds. Piscidia americana is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its vibrant floral display and adaptability to various soil types."
