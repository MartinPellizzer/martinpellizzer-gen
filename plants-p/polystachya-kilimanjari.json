    "intro": "Polystachya kilimanjari, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro spikegrass, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, pale green to white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in montane grasslands and forest margins. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation cover. Polystachya kilimanjari plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
