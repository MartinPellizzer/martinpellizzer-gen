    "intro": "Platystemon communis var. stylosus, commonly known as the slender-stemmed flatstem, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with slender, often hairy stems that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. This species is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient conditions."
