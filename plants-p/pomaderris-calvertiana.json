It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by small, round, black berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
