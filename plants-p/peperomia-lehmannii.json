    "intro": "Peperomia lehmannii, commonly known as the lemon peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Brazil. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its slow growth and attractive foliage, it is often used as a decorative plant in both homes and offices."
