    "intro": "Priestleya stokoei, commonly known as the Stokoe's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of western Ecuador. It is characterized by its ghostly white petals and sepals, which give it its ethereal appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its flowers are highly specialized, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Priestleya stokoei is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
