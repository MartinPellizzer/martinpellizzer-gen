    "intro": "Pandanus kurandaensis, commonly known as the Kuranda pandanus, is a tropical plant native to northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that form a dense, fan-like crown. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, which eventually develop into fibrous, cone-like fruits. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in wet, swampy environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses by Indigenous communities."
