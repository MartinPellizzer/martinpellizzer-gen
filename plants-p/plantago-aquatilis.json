    "intro": "Plantago aquatilis, commonly known as water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are pollinated by wind. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. Plantago aquatilis plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
