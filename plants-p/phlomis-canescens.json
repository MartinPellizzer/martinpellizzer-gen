    "intro": "Phlomis canescens, commonly known as the grey mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems covered in a dense layer of greyish-white hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, clustered yellow flowers in late summer, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall silvery-green appearance. Phlomis canescens thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides."
