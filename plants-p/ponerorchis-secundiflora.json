    "intro": "Ponerorchis secundiflora, commonly known as the secondary-flowered orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which produces flowers in two distinct clusters, one of which opens before the other. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its flowers are usually small and delicate, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ponerorchis secundiflora is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
