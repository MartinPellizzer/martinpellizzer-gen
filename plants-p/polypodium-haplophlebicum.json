    "intro": "Polypodium haplophlebicum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has a rhizomatous structure with pinnately compound leaves that are dark green and often have a leathery texture. Its fronds are usually narrow and elongated, with a distinctive appearance that makes it popular in horticulture. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the undersides of its sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
