It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has wiry, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with rocky or gravelly conditions."
