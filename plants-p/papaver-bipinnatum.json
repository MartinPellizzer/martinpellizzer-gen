    "intro": "Papaver bipinnatum, commonly known as the two-pinnate poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a distinctive black or dark red center. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. The leaves are deeply lobed and have a pinnate structure, giving the plant its scientific name."
