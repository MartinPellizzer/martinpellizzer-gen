    "intro": "Polytropia, commonly known as the \"garden spider\" or \"flower spider,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence, which consists of small, clustered flowers arranged in a spherical or flat-topped shape. The leaves are typically pinnately lobed, with a distinct basal rosette formation. Polytropia species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in moist, shaded environments. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their delicate, aromatic foliage and flowers."
