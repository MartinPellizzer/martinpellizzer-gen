    "intro": "Phymatopteris tenuipes, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 20 centimeters in length. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it an important component of xerophytic ecosystems."
