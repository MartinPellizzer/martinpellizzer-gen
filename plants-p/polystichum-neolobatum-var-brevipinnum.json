    "intro": "Polystichum neolobatum var. brevipinnum, commonly known as the short-pinnate cliff brake, is a variant of the cliff brake fern characterized by its compact, dense fronds. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark\u8910\u8272 rhizomes that help anchor it to rocky substrates. The fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with short, rounded pinnae that give the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky cliffs or in forest understories. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative foliage plant."
