    "intro": "Panicum sanguinale var. ciliare, commonly known as crimson beardgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, branching stems that often bear reddish tints. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are adorned with bracts having ciliate (frayed) margins, giving it its botanical name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a hairy texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens and erosion control."
