    "intro": "Pyrus merula, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny branches and small, oval leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue to black berries. These berries are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. The blackthorn is also notable for its role in supporting wildlife, particularly birds that feed on its berries."
