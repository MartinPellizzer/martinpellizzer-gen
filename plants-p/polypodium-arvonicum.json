    "intro": "Polypodium arvonicum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow on tree trunks or rocks in shaded environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires indirect light for optimal growth. Polypodium arvonicum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
