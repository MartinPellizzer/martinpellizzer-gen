    "intro": "Polystichum hastipinnum, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction."
