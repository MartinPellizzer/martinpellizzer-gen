    "intro": "Pedicularis batangensis, commonly known as the Batang lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic plants. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred petal that aids in pollination by specific insect species. The plant's morphology reflects adaptations to its high-altitude habitat, including hairy leaves that reduce water loss."
