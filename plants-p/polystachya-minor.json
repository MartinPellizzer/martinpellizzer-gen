    "intro": "Polystachya minor, commonly known as the dwarf flame orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces striking, flame-like inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. Polystachya minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
