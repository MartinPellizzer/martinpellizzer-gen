    "intro": "Pouteria wakere, commonly known as the white spondias, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by yellowish or orange-red berries. Its fruit is edible, though the pulp is typically thin and the seeds are large and hard. Pouteria wakere is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
