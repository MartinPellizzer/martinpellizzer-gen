    "intro": "Polygonum bistorta var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved bistort, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and basal leaves that are narrow and lanceolate. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish to reddish flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady habitats. The leaves and stems are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties."
