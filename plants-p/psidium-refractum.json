    "intro": "Psidium refractum, commonly known as the brittle guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its oval, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, berry-like fruits that are typically yellow or red when ripe. The fruit has a thin, delicate skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp, though it is less commercially cultivated compared to other guava species. Due to its fragile nature, the fruit is often harvested at an early stage to prevent damage."
