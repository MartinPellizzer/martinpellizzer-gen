    "intro": "Polystichum falcatipinnum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The leaves are bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori."
