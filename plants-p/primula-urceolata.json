    "intro": "Primula urceolata, commonly known as the water primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit, with broad, waxy leaves that form a dense mat near the ground. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near wetlands, stream banks, and ponds. Due to its attractive flowers and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
