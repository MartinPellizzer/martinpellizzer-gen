    "intro": "Polyacantha acaulis, commonly known as the stemless hibiscus, is a unique plant characterized by its lack of a distinct stem, with leaves directly emerging from the root system. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, often with a contrasting throat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its striking appearance and compact growth habit, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
