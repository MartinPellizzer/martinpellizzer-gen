    "intro": "Piper nieblyanum, commonly known as the Neibly's pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters, and it produces small, peppery fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Piper genus."
