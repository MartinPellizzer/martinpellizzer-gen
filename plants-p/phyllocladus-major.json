    "intro": "Phyllocladus major, commonly known as the silver pine, is a unique conifer native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage and its ability to thrive in coastal and subalpine environments. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often clustered in whorls around the stem, giving it a compact appearance. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Phyllocladus major is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
