    "intro": "Pongamia glabra var. xerocarpa, commonly known as the Indian beech or xerocarpic pongamia, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to India and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, compound leaves and produces yellow pods containing hard, woody seeds. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. The tree is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded lands."
