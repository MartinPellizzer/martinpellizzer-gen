It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is typically found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical structure supports its adaptation to arid environments, with reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss."
