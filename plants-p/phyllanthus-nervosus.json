    "intro": "Phyllanthus nervosus, commonly known as the hairy bladder nut, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with prominent veins and a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
