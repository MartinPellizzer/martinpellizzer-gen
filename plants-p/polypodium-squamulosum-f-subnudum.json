    "intro": "Polypodium squamulosum f. subnudum, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The fronds are typically shorter and more narrow compared to the typical form, with a distinctive subnudate (nearly smooth) appearance on the lower surface. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its unique morphology makes it a distinctive and sought-after specimen in horticultural collections."
