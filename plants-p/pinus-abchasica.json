It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically 2 to 4 centimeters long. The tree produces cones that are usually less than 5 centimeters in length, containing winged seeds. It thrives in mountainous areas with well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. The Abkhazian pine plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is valued for its timber and ornamental qualities."
