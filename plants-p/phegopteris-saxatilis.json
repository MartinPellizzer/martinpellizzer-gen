    "intro": "Phegopteris saxatilis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris saxatilis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
