    "intro": "Pinus michoacaensis, commonly known as the Michoacan pine, is a coniferous tree native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long, containing winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, it is considered a vulnerable species."
