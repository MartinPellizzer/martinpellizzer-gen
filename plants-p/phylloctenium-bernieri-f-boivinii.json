    "intro": "Phylloctenium bernieri f. boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's phylloctenium, is a rare and distinctive fern native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds with a unique, wavy appearance. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically green and have a leathery texture, adapting to the humid and shaded conditions of its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
