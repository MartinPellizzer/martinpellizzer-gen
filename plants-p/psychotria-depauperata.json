    "intro": "Psychotria depauperata, commonly known as the \"poorly endowed psychotria,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It is often found growing in shaded, moist environments, typically along stream banks or in the undergrowth of dense vegetation. Despite its modest appearance, it plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
