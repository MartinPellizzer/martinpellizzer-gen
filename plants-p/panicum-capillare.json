    "intro": "Panicum capillare, commonly known as silky grass or silky panicum, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and delicate, feathery inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soils. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to spread across wetland habitats.
