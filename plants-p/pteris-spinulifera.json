    "intro": "Pteris spinulifera, commonly known as the spinulose water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are produced in sori located on the undersides of the fronds. Pteris spinulifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
