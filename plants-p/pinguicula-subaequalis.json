    "intro": "Pinguicula subaequalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, rosette-like leaves that are covered in sticky glands to trap insects. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its unique trapping mechanism and aesthetic appeal make it a popular choice for specialized plant collections."
