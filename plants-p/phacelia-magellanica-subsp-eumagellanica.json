    "intro": "Phacelia magellanica subsp. eumagellanica, commonly known as the Magellan phacelia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly the Magellanic region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
