    "intro": "Panicum liton, commonly known as the slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open areas, such as fields and disturbed soils, and thrives in full sun. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and a flowering spike that bears small, clustered inflorescences. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
