    "intro": "Pisophaca coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the summer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils and low moisture environments. Due to its resilience, it is often found in disturbed areas and is used in some traditional herbal practices."
