    "intro": "Platanthera robinsonii var. longicalcarata, commonly known as the long-spurred lady's-slipper, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers with long, slender spurs that extend from the petals. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic woodlands and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for nutrient uptake. The species is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and degradation."
