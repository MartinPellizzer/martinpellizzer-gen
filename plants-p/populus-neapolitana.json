    "intro": "Populus neapolitana, commonly known as the Neapolitan poplar, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for urban landscaping."
