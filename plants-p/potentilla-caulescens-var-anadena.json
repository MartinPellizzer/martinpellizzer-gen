    "intro": "Potentilla caulescens var. anadena, commonly known as the silver potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
