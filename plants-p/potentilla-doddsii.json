    "intro": "Potentilla doddsii, commonly known as Dodds' cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, grayish-white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Potentilla doddsii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and adaptability."
