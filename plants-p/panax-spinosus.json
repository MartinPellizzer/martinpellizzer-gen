    "intro": "Panax spinosus, commonly known as the spiny ginseng, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spiny stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, though they are less commonly used than those of Panax ginseng. The botanical features of Panax spinosus make it a unique and valuable species in traditional herbal medicine."
