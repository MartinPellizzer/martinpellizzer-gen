It is native to the rainforests of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers, which are often adorned with contrasting white or yellow markings. Its leaves are typically elliptical and glossy, and the plant produces small, dark berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Psychotria nonatelioides is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to fully understand its botanical and pharmacological significance."
