    "intro": "Parrya tschimganica, commonly known as the Tschimgan parrya, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Parrya tschimganica is often found in rocky soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
