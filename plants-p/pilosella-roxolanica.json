    "intro": "Pilosella roxolanica, commonly known as the alpine hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and thistles. The plant is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems, which help it survive in harsh mountain environments. Pilosella roxolanica typically grows in rocky soils and high-altitude meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to the extreme climate of its native habitat."
