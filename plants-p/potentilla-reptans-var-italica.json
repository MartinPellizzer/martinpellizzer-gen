    "intro": "Potentilla reptans var. italica, commonly known as Italian creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are oval-shaped with finely toothed edges, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
