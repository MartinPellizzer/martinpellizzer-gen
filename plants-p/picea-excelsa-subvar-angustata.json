    "intro": "Picea excelsa subvar. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white spruce, is a subspecies of the white spruce native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are narrower than those of the typical white spruce. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and its bark is typically thin and scaly. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones. This subspecies is valued for its timber and its role in forest ecosystems."
