It features narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive soft texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration projects."
