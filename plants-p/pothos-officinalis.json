It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically solid green, though variegated forms exist. The plant is known for its adaptability, thriving in low-light conditions and requiring minimal water. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and attach to surfaces, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or shelves. Botanically, it belongs to the Araceae family and produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by dark blue berries."
