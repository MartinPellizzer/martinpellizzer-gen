    "intro": "Prepusa connata, commonly known as the Florida prepusa, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of wetlands and marshes. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
