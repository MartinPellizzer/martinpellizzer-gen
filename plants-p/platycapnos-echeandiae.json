    "intro": "Platycapnos echeandiae, commonly known as the Echeandia's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
