    "intro": "Phaeopappus wolgensis, commonly known as the dark pappus plant, is a rare flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dark purple to black bracts, which give it its common name, and its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Phaeopappus wolgensis is considered a vulnerable species."
