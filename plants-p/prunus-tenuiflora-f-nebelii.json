    "intro": "Prunus tenuiflora f. nebelii, commonly known as the clouded cherry, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Prunus tenuiflora species. It is characterized by its pale pink to almost white flowers, which are often covered in a fine, waxy bloom that gives the appearance of being veiled in mist. The plant produces small, red, edible fruits that are similar to cherries but are typically less sweet and more tart. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often cultivated for its unique floral display. Due to its rarity and specific growing requirements, it is a prized plant among horticulturists and botanical enthusiasts."
