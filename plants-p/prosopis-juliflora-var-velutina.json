    "intro": "Prosopis juliflora var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Its bark is thick and often fissured, providing protection against fire and grazing. The wood is hard and durable, making it useful for construction and fuel."
