    "intro": "Pentapera sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian five-leaf plant, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Sicily. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive five-lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in Mediterranean shrublands.
