    "intro": "Ptycholepis, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Apocynaceae family. These plants are native to Africa and are characterized by their showy, often colorful flowers and milky sap. Ptycholepis species typically have opposite leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that are pollinated by insects. The plant's milky latex is a notable botanical feature, often used in traditional medicine. Some species are also cultivated for their ornamental value due to their attractive blooms."
