    "intro": "Physaria argyraea var. diffusa, commonly known as the silverleaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, silver-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
