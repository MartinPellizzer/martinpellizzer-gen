    "intro": "Pyramia, commonly known as the pyramidal orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family. These plants are characterized by their unique pyramidal or spire-like inflorescences, which are composed of numerous small, often fragrant flowers. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and the stems are often woody or semi-woody. Pyramia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
