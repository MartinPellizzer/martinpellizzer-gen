    "intro": "Phreatia cylindrostachya var. grandifolia, commonly known as the giant phreatia orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant features a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and reducing water loss. This orchid is often found growing epiphytically on trees or rocks in primary rainforests."
