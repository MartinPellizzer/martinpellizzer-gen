    "intro": "Plocoglottis hirta, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to the Pacific Islands, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
