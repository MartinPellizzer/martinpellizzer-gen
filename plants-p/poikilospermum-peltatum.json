    "intro": "Poikilospermum peltatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its botanical features make it an important species in its native habitat, though it is sometimes considered invasive in other regions. The plant's adaptability to various soil types and climates contributes to its widespread distribution."
