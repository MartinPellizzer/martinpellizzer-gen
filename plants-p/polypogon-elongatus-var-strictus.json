    "intro": "Polypogon elongatus var. strictus, commonly known as the narrowleaf basketgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Due to its adaptability and ecological benefits, it is often found in restoration projects aimed at wetland conservation."
