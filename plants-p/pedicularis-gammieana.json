    "intro": "Pedicularis gammieana, commonly known as the Gammie's lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred structure that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystem health."
