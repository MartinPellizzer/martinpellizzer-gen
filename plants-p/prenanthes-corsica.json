    "intro": "Prenanthes corsica, commonly known as the Corsican water dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces distinctive, elongated, bladder-like fruits. Prenanthes corsica is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its potential medicinal properties."
