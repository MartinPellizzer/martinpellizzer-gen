    "intro": "Potamogeton miyakozimensis, commonly known as Miyako watermilfoil, is a species of aquatic plant native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is a submerged or floating-leaved plant that typically grows in freshwater environments such as lakes and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species within its native range."
