    "intro": "Phegopteris finisterrae, commonly known as the Canary Islands fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
