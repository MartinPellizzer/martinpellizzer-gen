    "intro": "Pomaderris apetala, commonly known as the leafless pomaderris, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that are often reduced or absent in some species. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that attract nectar-feeding insects, particularly honeyeaters. Its fruits are small, round berries that mature to a dark purple color, providing food for native wildlife. Pomaderris apetala is often found in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests, thriving in well-drained soils."
