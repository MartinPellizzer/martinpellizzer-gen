    "intro": "Pedicularis roylei var. brevigaleata, commonly known as the short-stalked lousewort, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is notable for its unique floral structure and is often found in association with other alpine flora."
