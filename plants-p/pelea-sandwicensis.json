    "intro": "Pelea sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian pelea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mesic forests and streamside areas. It has narrow, strap-like leaves and is often found in the understory of native vegetation. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Hawaii."
