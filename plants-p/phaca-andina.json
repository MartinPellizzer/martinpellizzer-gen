It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. Phaca andina is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally by indigenous communities for its purported health benefits."
