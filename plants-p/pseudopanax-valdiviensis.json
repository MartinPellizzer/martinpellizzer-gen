    "intro": "Pseudopanax valdiviensis, commonly known as the lancewood, is a unique evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are often covered in small, raised dots. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, woody fruits containing a single seed. It is adapted to grow in moist, temperate climates and is typically found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
