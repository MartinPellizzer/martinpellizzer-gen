    "intro": "Picea abies f. pectinata, commonly known as the pendulous spruce, is a unique variant of the Norway spruce. It is characterized by its gracefully drooping branches that create a distinctive, weeping appearance. The plant exhibits dense foliage with needle-like leaves that are slightly longer than those of the typical Norway spruce. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. This form is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture and landscape design."
