    "intro": "Pentaptera coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved pentaptera, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
