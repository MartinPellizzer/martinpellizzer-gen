It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its bi-pinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine, and it is also valued as an ornamental plant.
