    "intro": "Pedicularis callicoma, commonly known as the golden monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that resemble the face of a monkey. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive hooded shape and spurred petals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations."
