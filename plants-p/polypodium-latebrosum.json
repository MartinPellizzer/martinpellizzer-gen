    "intro": "Polypodium latebrosum, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its robust, evergreen rhizome and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces fertile fronds with sporangia that are clustered in sori, typical of many ferns. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive, broad shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Polypodium latebrosum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in forest ecosystems."
