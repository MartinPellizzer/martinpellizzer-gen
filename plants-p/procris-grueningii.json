    "intro": "Procris grueningii, commonly known as the Gruening's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique growth habit, often growing as a terrestrial herb with a single, unbranched stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Procris grueningii is considered critically endangered and is rarely seen in the wild."
