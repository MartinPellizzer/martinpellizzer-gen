    "intro": "Pterozonium reniforme, commonly known as the kidney fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in humid forests. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile leaves appearing in the second year. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
