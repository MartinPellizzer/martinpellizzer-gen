    "intro": "Poinciana pannosa, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange inflorescences that resemble flames, which bloom in the summer months. The plant has pinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental tree due to its vibrant floral display. The seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread in suitable environments."
