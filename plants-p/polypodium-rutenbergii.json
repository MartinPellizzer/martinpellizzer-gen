    "intro": "Polypodium rutenbergii, commonly known as the Rutenberg's polypody, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds."
