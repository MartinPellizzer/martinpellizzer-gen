    "intro": "Paspalum pygmaeum, commonly known as dwarf paspalum, is a small, mat-forming grass native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in moist, sunny environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spikes. It is well adapted to wet conditions and can tolerate periodic flooding. Paspalum pygmaeum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
