    "intro": "Pycreus sabulosus, commonly known as the sand spurge, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It has small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread across open landscapes. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes."
