It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its slender, prostrate stems that hug the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive hooded structure. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
