    "intro": "Phyllanthus jamaicensis, commonly known as Jamaican spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces a milky latex when its stems or leaves are broken, which is a common feature among members of its family. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
