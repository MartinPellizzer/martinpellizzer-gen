    "intro": "Piper subcinereum, commonly known as the white banyan or white pepper vine, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that develop into dark blue to black berries. The plant is part of the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species. Its berries are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant's rapid growth and climbing habit make it a common ornamental and invasive species in some areas."
