    "intro": "Polycoryne, commonly known as the fairy polypore, is a type of bracket fungus that belongs to the family Polycystidiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped or shield-like caps that are usually pale yellow to brown in color. The fruiting bodies typically grow on dead wood, especially hardwoods, and are often found in forested areas. The spore-bearing surface is smooth and lacks a distinct stem, which is a key identifying feature. Polycoryne species are generally saprophytic, decomposing wood through the breakdown of lignin and cellulose."
