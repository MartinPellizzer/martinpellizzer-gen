It features dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. These flowers are followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
