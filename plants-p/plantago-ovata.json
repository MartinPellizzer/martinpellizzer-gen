    "intro": "Plantago ovata, commonly known as psyllium, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its small, bristly seeds that are rich in soluble fiber. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. Psyllium is widely used in herbal medicine and as a dietary supplement due to its high fiber content. Its seeds are often consumed whole to promote digestive health and regularity."
