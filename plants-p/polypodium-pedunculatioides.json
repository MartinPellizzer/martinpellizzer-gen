    "intro": "Polypodium pedunculatioides, commonly known as the creeping polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in a rosette formation. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually lanceolate or ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Polypodium pedunculatioides thrives in humid climates and is often found in forest understories or on rocky substrates."
