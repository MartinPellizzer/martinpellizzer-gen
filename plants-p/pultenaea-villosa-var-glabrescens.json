    "intro": "Pultenaea villosa var. glabrescens, commonly known as the silky pultenaea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often glabrous stems and small, bright yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The leaves are typically narrow and covered with fine hairs, which become less prominent as the plant matures. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowering display."
