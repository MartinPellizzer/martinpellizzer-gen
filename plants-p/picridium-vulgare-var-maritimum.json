    "intro": "Picridium vulgare var. maritimum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads surrounded by spiky, silver-green bracts. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh maritime conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal sands."
