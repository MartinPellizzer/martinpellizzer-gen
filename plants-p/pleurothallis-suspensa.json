    "intro": "Pleurothallis suspensa, commonly known as the hanging pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, often arranged in clusters. Its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Pleurothallis suspensa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance."
