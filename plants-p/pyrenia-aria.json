    "intro": "Pyrenia aria, commonly known as the common pyrenia, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus that is typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found growing on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate forest environments. Pyrenia aria is known for its slow growth and is used as an indicator species for assessing air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
