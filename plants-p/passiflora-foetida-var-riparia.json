    "intro": "Passiflora foetida var. riparia, commonly known as the swamp passionflower, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with intricate structures, including a crown of white filaments and a central cluster of blue and purple sepals. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near waterways or in swampy areas. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, velvety hairs. The fruit, which develops from the flower, is a small, edible berry with a tangy, acidic flavor."
