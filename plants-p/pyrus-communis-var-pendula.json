    "intro": "Pyrus communis var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping apple tree, is a cultivar of the common apple tree characterized by its distinctive cascading branches. It features delicate, narrow leaves that hang in a weeping fashion, creating a striking visual effect. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in spring, followed by edible apples that are typically smaller and more sour than those of the common apple. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This ornamental tree is often planted for its aesthetic appeal rather than for fruit production."
