    "intro": "Pavonia rosea var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid rosemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, rose-like pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
