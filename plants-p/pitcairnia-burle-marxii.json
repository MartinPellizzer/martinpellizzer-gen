It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that resembles a crown, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and waxy, adapted to collect and store water in its native humid environment. Its flowering period typically occurs during the warmer months, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses. The species is named in honor of the Brazilian modernist architect and landscape designer, Roberto Burle Marx."
