    "intro": "Pachycereus grandis var. gigas, commonly known as the giant cardon cactus, is a towering columnar cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It features thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to 20 meters in height, adapted for water storage in its succulent tissue. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its spines are modified leaves, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. This species is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living over 100 years in its native habitat."
