It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. It is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and low oxygen levels, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and high-altitude gardens."
