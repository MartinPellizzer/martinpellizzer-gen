    "intro": "Polygonum denudatum, commonly known as the nakedstem smartweed, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, often hairless stems and simple, alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and lack stipules. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. Polygonum denudatum is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
