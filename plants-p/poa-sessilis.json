    "intro": "Poa sessilis, commonly known as the sessile bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length, and its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-like cluster of small, spike-like flowers. Poa sessilis is characterized by its sessile (stemless) lemma, which is a distinctive botanical feature. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
