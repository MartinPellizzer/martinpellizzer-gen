It features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has wiry, sprawling stems covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. Silverweed is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments."
