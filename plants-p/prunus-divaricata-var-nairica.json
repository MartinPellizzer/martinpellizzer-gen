    "intro": "Prunus divaricata var. nairica, commonly known as the Nairi cherry, is a shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, ovate leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in spring, followed by small, edible berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
