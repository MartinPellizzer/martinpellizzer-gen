    "intro": "Pinus frieseana, commonly known as the Friesian pine, is a rare and endangered species native to the island of Sardinia. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, straight trunk and dense, dark green needles. The tree produces small, oval-shaped cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical research. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare species from habitat loss and environmental threats."
