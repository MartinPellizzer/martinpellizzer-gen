It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with prominent, impressed veins that give it its common name. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, which are often surrounded by dense, woolly hair. Psychotria impressinervia is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
