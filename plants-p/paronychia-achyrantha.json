It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are succulent and covered in a sticky substance, which helps to deter herbivores. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
