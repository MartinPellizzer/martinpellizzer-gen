    "intro": "Polypodium baronii, commonly known as the Baron's fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiaceae family. Polypodium baronii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
