    "intro": "Potentilla rupestris f. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental stonecrop, is a compact, low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to thrive in dry, rocky environments. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. The species is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in arid and alpine habitats."
