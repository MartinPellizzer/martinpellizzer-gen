    "intro": "Pleocaulus sessiloides, commonly known as the small-leaf arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cavity. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in a spike, often emerging from the leaf axils. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environments. The plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of starch."
