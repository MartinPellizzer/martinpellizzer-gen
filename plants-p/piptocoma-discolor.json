    "intro": "Piptocoma discolor, commonly known as the white-flowered pittosporum, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a dark green color with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Piptocoma discolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soils."
