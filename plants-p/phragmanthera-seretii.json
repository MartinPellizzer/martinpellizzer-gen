    "intro": "Phragmanthera seretii, commonly known as the Seret's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with translucent, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the dry season, often in shaded, humid environments. Due to its restricted habitat and threatened status, it is considered critically endangered. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized adaptations and role in the ecological balance of its native region."
