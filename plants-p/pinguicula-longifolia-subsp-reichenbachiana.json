    "intro": "Pinguicula longifolia subsp. reichenbachiana, commonly known as the long-stemmed butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Andes Mountains. It features delicate, glandular leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest small insects. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity to flourish. Its subspecies distinction is based on morphological differences, particularly in leaf and flower structure."
