    "intro": "Pleopeltis parvifrons, commonly known as the small-fruited rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds. Pleopeltis parvifrons is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
