    "intro": "Psilorhegma, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae. These plants are native to various regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. They are characterized by their striking blue or violet flowers, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Psilorhegma species typically grow in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. The plants have linear leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contribute to their ornamental value."
