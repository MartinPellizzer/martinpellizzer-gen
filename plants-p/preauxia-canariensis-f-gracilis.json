    "intro": "Preauxia canariensis f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender Canary Island pine, is a unique variant of the Canary Island pine, characterized by its more delicate and compact growth habit. It is a gymnosperm, belonging to the family Pinaceae, and is native to the Canary Islands. This form exhibits smaller, more closely spaced needles compared to the typical species, giving it a distinct appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species for ecological and botanical study."
