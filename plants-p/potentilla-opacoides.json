    "intro": "Potentilla opacoides, commonly known as the woolly cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters of five. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Potentilla opacoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
