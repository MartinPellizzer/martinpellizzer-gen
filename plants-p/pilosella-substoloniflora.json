It is a perennial herb with a low-growing habit, characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Pilosella substoloniflora is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas."
