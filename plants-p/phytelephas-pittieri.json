    "intro": "Phytelephas pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's balsa, is a member of the Palmae family and is native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by large, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Its trunk is highly valued for its lightweight, fibrous wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and model-making. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Phytelephas pittieri is considered a vulnerable species."
