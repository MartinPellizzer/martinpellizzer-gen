    "intro": "Poa urssulensis, commonly known as the Urssulensk Meadowgrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed florets. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
