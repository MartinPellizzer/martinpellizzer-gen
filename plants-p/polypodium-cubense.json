    "intro": "Polypodium cubense, commonly known as the Cuban holly fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and parts of the Greater Antilles. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rugged, serrated margin. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments, often growing in forest understories or on rocky substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups. Polypodium cubense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
