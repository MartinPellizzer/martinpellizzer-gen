    "intro": "Prunus rugulosa, commonly known as the Japanese cherry plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are ovate with a slightly serrated margin. The fruit is a small, yellowish plum that ripens in late summer, though it is not typically eaten by humans. Prunus rugulosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and landscapes."
