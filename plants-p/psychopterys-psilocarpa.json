    "intro": "Psychopterys psilocarpa, commonly known as the sacred mushroom tree, is a species of psychoactive plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Amanitaceae family and is notable for containing hallucinogenic compounds such as psilocybin and psilocin in its fruiting bodies. The plant is often found growing in humid, shaded environments within the rainforest canopy. Its spore-bearing structures, or gills, are typically pale to dark brown and release spores when mature. Due to its psychoactive properties, it has been traditionally used in spiritual and ceremonial contexts by indigenous communities."
