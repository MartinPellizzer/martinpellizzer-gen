It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
