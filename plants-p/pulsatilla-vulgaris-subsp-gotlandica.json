    "intro": "Pulsatilla vulgaris subsp. gotlandica, commonly known as the Gotland pasqueflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Baltic region. It features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, pinkish-white, cup-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its unique, woolly appearance and is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
