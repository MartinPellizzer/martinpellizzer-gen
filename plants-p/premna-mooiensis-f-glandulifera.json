    "intro": "Premna mooiensis f. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular premna, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often glandular-dotted on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, spherical berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The glandular structures on its leaves and stems are a distinguishing feature, contributing to its unique botanical identity."
