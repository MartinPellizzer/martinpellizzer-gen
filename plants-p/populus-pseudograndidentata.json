    "intro": "Populus pseudograndidentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other poplar species. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, while the branches are often drooping. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
