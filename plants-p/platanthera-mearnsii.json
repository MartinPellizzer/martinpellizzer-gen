    "intro": "Platanthera mearnsii, commonly known as Mearns' lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, flowering stem that bears a dense, dark green to brownish-black spike of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are often described as having a sweet, vanilla-like scent, which helps attract pollinators. Platanthera mearnsii is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its complex ecological relationships."
