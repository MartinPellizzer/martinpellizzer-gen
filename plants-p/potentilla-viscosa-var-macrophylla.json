    "intro": "Potentilla viscosa var. macrophylla, commonly known as the sticky cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves with a sticky texture, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape and have a rough, textured surface. This variety is often found in rocky or well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
