    "intro": "Paspalum michauxianum var. villosum, commonly known as hairy paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
