    "intro": "Prunus yunnanensis var. polybotrys, commonly known as the Yunnan cherry or Yunnan plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southwestern China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, and they turn yellow in autumn. The fruit is a small, yellow or orange drupe that ripens in summer, containing a single stone. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms."
