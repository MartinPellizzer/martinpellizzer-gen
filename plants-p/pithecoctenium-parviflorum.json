    "intro": "Pithecoctenium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered pithecoctenium, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical botanical gardens."
