It features waxy, ovate leaves with a striking silver and green mottled pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is primarily valued for its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it ideal for indoor cultivation. Its compact size and ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for tabletop displays and hanging baskets."
