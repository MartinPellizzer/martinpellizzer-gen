    "intro": "Phaca prebblei, commonly known as the Pebble's phaca, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, contributing to its low profile. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Phaca prebblei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
