    "intro": "Platanus nana, commonly known as the dwarf plane tree, is a small, slow-growing tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that are typically 5\u20139 inches in diameter. The tree produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Platanus nana is often used in urban landscaping due to its tolerance of pollution and compact size."
