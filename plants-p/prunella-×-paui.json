    "intro": "Prunella \u00d7 paui, commonly known as the purple deadnettle, is a hybrid plant in the mint family (Lamiaceae). It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple or blue, which are typically arranged in whorls along the stem. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it often thrives in moist, disturbed soils. Prunella \u00d7 paui is commonly found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in supporting pollinators."
