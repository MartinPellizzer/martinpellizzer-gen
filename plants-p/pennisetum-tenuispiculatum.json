It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and narrow, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. It has a clumping growth habit and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its delicate appearance. Pennisetum tenuispiculatum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in certain environments."
