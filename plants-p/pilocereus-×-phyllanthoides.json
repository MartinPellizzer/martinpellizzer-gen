    "intro": "Pilocereus \u00d7 phyllanthoides, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a hybrid cactus species that combines the vibrant flowers of Pilocereus with the colorful, fleshy stems of Phyllanthus. It is native to South America and is characterized by its thick, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and aesthetic appeal."
