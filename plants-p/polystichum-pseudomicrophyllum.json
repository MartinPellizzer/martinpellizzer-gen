    "intro": "Polystichum pseudomicrophyllum, commonly known as the dwarf lady fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow to a height of less than 30 centimeters. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile fronds that produce spores on the underside of the leaves. Its foliage is often dense and forms a compact, mat-like structure, making it suitable for rock gardens or shaded woodland settings. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade."
