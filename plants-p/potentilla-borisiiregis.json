    "intro": "Potentilla borisiiregis, commonly known as the Borisor's cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in fine hairs. Potentilla borisiiregis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
