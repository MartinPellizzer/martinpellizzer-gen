    "intro": "Parthenium tomentosum var. tomentosum, commonly known as white cudweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and small, white to pale yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It has a short stature, usually reaching up to 30 cm in height, and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its fine hairs and compact growth, it is often mistaken for other similar species in the Asteraceae family."
