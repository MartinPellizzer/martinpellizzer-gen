    "intro": "Pilosocereus minensis, commonly known as the Minas night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide insulation and protection. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and flowering habits, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
