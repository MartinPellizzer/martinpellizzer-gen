    "intro": "Portulaca rubens, commonly known as the red portulaca, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a succulent species that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments due to its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves and stems. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday, a characteristic known as nyctophytes. Its simple, alternate leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth texture. Portulaca rubens is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought tolerance and colorful blooms."
