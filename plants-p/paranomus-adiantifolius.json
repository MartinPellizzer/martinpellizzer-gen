    "intro": "Paranomus adiantifolius, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Paranomus adiantifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
