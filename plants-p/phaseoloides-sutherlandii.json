It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, violet-blue flowers that open in the morning. The plant has climbing stems that twine around supports, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
