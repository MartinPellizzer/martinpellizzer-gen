    "intro": "Plantago cumingiana var. minor, commonly known as the lesser plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are borne on slender stalks. It is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. This species is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
