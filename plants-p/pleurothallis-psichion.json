    "intro": "Pleurothallis psichion, commonly known as the \"white-lipped pleurothallis,\" is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its flowers are often clustered in racemes and bloom during the rainy season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
