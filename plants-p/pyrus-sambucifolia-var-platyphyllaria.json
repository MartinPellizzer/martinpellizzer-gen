    "intro": "Pyrus sambucifolia var. platyphyllaria, commonly known as the broad-leafed whitebeam, is a variant of the whitebeam tree native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically larger and more flattened than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in the autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to support local wildlife."
