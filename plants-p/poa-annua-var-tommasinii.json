    "intro": "Poa annua var. tommasinii, commonly known as the Italian meadow grass, is a variant of the annual bluegrass species. It is a low-growing, perennial grass that typically forms dense mats in meadows and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
