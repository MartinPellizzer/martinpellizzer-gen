    "intro": "Patzkea paniculata subsp. macrostachys, commonly known as the giant patzkea, is a striking member of the Araliaceae family native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length, making it one of the largest ferns in the world. The plant produces impressive, branched inflorescences with small, clustered flowers, which are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and nutrient-rich soil. Due to its size and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental and scientific value."
