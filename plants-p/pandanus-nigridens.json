    "intro": "Pandanus nigridens, commonly known as the black pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, stiff, paddle-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into spiny, woody fruits. Its leaves are fibrous and can be woven into mats and thatching materials. Pandanus nigridens thrives in coastal and wetland environments, often forming dense stands in humid climates."
