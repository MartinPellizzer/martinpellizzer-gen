    "intro": "Prunus litigiosa, commonly known as the desert almond, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has small, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible fruits that are similar to peaches but less commonly consumed by humans. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Prunus litigiosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and providing food for wildlife."
