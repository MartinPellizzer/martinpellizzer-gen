    "intro": "Phleum monspeliense, commonly known as mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to bluish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray coloration that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Phleum monspeliense is often found in rocky or mountainous areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
