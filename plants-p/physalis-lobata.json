    "intro": "Physalis lobata, commonly known as the common ground cherry, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes and peppers, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into distinctive, lantern-shaped fruits encased in a papery husk. These fruits, which ripen to a bright orange or red, are edible and often used in culinary applications. Physalis lobata thrives in temperate climates and is often grown as a ornamental or for its edible fruits."
