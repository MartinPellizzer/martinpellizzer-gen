    "intro": "Psychotria trichotoma, commonly known as the \"Coca plant\" in some regions, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Andes, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white or greenish flowers. It contains alkaloids, including cocaine, which has led to its historical and contemporary use in both traditional and illicit contexts. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is also of interest in botanical and pharmacological research."
