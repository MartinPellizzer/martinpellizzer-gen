It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray leaves and tufted flower heads, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a common component of wetland vegetation. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect life."
