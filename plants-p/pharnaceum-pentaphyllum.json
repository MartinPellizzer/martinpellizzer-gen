It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth of tropical forests. Its botanical structure includes a short stem with five distinct leaf lobes, giving it its scientific name. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
