    "intro": "Plantago \u00d7 cadevallii, commonly known as the hybrid plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its broad, ribbed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
