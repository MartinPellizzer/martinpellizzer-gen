    "intro": "Parasenecio maowenensis, commonly known as the Maowen ragged robin, is a flowering plant native to China, specifically found in the Yunnan Province. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous regions and forest understories. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
