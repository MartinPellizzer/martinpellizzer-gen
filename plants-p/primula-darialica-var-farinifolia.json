    "intro": "Primula darialica var. farinifolia, commonly known as the farinifolia primrose, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
