    "intro": "Polypodium loriceum var. squamuligerum, commonly known as the squamuligerous wall fern, is a variant of the wall fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are often covered with small, scale-like structures called squamules, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in humid climates. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates and absorb moisture efficiently. The fronds are usually leathery and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens or natural landscapes."
