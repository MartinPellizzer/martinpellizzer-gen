    "intro": "Polypodium platyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf polypody, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically broad and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
