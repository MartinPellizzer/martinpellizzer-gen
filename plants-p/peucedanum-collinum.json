    "intro": "Peucedanum collinum, commonly known as hill angelica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its aromatic leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. The fruit is a small, dry schizocarp that splits into two parts when mature, aiding in seed dispersal."
