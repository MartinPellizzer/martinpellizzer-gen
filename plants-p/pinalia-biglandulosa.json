    "intro": "Pinalia biglandulosa, commonly known as the two-lobed pinyon, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and distinctive two-lobed bracts that enclose its yellow flowers. The plant produces cone-like structures that contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Pinalia biglandulosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert flora and fauna."
