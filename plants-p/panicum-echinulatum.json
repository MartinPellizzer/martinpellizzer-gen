    "intro": "Panicum echinulatum, commonly known as the spiny panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spiky inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces wind-pollinated flowers. Panicum echinulatum plays an important role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
