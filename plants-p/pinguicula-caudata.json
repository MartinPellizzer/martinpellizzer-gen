    "intro": "Pinguicula caudata, commonly known as the long-tongued butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces a single, elongated flower stalk with a distinctive pink or purple flower. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
