    "intro": "Paronychia echinata var. minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered sandmat, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, ribbed stems and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for arid gardens. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular specimen in rock gardens and xeriscaping."
