    "intro": "Peucedanum guvenianum, commonly known as the Turkish cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like flower clusters. It is native to Turkey and parts of the Middle East, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves that emit a mild, spicy scent when crushed. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are small and white, forming dense, rounded umbels that attract pollinators. The root system of Peucedanum guvenianum is fibrous and contributes to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
