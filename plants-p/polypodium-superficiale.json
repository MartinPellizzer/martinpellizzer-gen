    "intro": "Polypodium superficiale, commonly known as the floating fern, is a tropical epiphytic fern that thrives in humid environments. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear to float on the surface of water or moist soil. The plant's rhizomes grow along the surface, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas. It is typically found in shaded, moist habitats such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its unique growth habit and appearance make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native range."
