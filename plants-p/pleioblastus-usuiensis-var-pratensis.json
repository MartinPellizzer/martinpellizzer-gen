It is a clump-forming grass that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features slender, arching leaves that are usually a bright green color, with a fine, silky texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade, making it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
