    "intro": "Polypodium nigripes, commonly known as the black-stemmed shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Polypodium nigripes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
