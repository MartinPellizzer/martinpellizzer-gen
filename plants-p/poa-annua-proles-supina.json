    "intro": "Poa annua proles supina, commonly known as the prostrate annual meadowgrass, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant that thrives in a variety of soil types. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, with slender stems that lie close to the soil surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue. This species is commonly found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along roadsides, where it can quickly colonize open spaces."
