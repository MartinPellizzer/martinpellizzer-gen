    "intro": "Ptyssiglottis anguina, commonly known as the snake orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, snake-like appearance, with elongated, twisted inflorescences that resemble a serpent. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns, adapted for specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ptyssiglottis anguina is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
