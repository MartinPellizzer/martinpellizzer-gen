    "intro": "Pseudoperistylus microceras, commonly known as the small-capped pseudoperistylus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in forest undergrowth. Its flowers, though not showy, are highly specialized, with intricate structures that facilitate pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
