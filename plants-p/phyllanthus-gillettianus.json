It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, green, fleshy leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warmer climates."
