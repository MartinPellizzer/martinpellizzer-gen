    "intro": "Phyllagathis velutina, commonly known as the velvet myrtle, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety hair. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The leaves and flowers are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a component of forest ecosystems."
