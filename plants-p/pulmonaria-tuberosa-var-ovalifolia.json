    "intro": "Pulmonaria tuberosa var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It features basal rosettes of ovate, hairy, and often reddish leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in early spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its foliage and flowers contribute to early-season pollinator support and add ornamental value to shaded landscapes."
