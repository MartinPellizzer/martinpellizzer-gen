It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, spider-like appearance due to its finely branched stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Podolepis arachnoidea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
