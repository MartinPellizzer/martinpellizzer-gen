    "intro": "Phalacroderis, commonly known as the sea moths, are marine invertebrates belonging to the class Phalacrodermata. They are characterized by their unique, fan-like appendages that aid in movement through water. These creatures are typically found in shallow coastal waters and are often associated with coral reefs. Their body structure is adapted for a sessile or semi-sessile lifestyle, with a soft, leathery body covered in fine, feather-like structures. Phalacroderis species play a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the biodiversity of reef environments."
