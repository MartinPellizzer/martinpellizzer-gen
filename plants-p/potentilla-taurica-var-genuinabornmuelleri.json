    "intro": "Potentilla taurica var. genuinabornmuelleri, commonly known as the Tauric cinquefoil, is a shrub native to the Caucasus region. It features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters. The plant has serrated, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, adapted to the dry, rocky environments it inhabits. It is often found in steppe and forest-steppe zones, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
