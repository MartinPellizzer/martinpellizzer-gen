    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 fallax, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in temperate climates."
