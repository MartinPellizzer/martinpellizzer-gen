    "intro": "Plantago argentea subsp. liburnica, commonly known as silver plantain, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of broad, silver-gray leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowering stems bear dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential healing properties."
