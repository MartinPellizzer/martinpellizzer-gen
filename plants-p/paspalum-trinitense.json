    "intro": "Paspalum trinitense, commonly known as Trinidad grass, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Paspalum trinitense is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
