    "intro": "Pueraria thunbergii f. alba, commonly known as the white kudzu, is a variant of the kudzu vine characterized by its pale to white flowers. It is a climbing legume native to East Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces long, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
