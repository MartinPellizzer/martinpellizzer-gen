    "intro": "Parosela lloydii, commonly known as the Lloyd's parosela, is a flowering plant native to the island of Socotra. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or limestone soils. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
