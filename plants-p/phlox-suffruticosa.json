It features dense, mat-forming growth with clusters of showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant has woody stems that become more prominent with age, and its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover. The flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
