    "intro": "Pollia \u00d7 horsfieldii, commonly known as the Horsfield's spiderwort, is a hybrid plant belonging to the family Commelinaceae.

The plant is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, contrasting with the showy bracts that attract pollinators. Pollia \u00d7 horsfieldii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ease of cultivation."
