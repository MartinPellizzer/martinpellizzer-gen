    "intro": "Pycreus sanguinolentus subsp. micronux, commonly known as the Crimson-veined Dwarf Pycreus, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves with distinctive red veins and compact, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its flowers are usually white to pale pink, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
