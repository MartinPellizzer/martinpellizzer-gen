    "intro": "Potentilla caulescens proles anadena, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features wiry, ascending stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and elliptical, with a slightly serrated edge, and are arranged alternately along the stems. This species is well adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils."
