    "intro": "Phaius epiphyticus, commonly known as the epiphytic orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple or brown markings. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water and nutrients. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
