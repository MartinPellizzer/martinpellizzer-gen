    "intro": "Prasophyllum sphacelatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved greenhood, is an orchid species native to Australia. It is characterized by its striking greenish-purple flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in heathlands and sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It produces a single, erect flower spike with a single flower, which is notable for its unique hood-like structure. Prasophyllum sphacelatum is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological niche in the Australian flora."
