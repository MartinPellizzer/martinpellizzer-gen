    "intro": "Pleopeltis corradii, commonly known as the Corradi's pleated fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, pleated fronds that give it a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water in humid environments. Pleopeltis corradii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to shaded, moist conditions."
