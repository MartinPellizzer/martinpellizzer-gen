    "intro": "Paspalum malacophyllum var. longipilum, commonly known as the long-haired paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and distinctive, fluffy inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its dense growth habit makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat restoration. It is also used in some regions for forage and as a ornamental grass."
