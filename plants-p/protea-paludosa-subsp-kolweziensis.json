    "intro": "Protea paludosa subsp. kolweziensis, commonly known as the Kolwezi protea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the humid lowland forests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous white to pink bracts that surround a cluster of small, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in association with other understory flora in tropical rainforests. Its foliage consists of broad, leathery leaves that are arranged in a dense, bushy habit. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a valuable component of the region's biodiversity."
