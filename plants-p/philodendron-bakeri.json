It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Philodendron bakeri thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical plant collections."
