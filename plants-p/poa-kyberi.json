    "intro": "Poa kyberi, commonly known as the Kyber grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact inflorescences. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its flowering stems bear small, spikelet-like clusters of flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. Poa kyberi is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
