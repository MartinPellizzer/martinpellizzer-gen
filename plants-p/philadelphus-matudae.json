    "intro": "Philadelphus matudae, commonly known as the Matudae Mockorange, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. Its flowers are clustered in racemes and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Philadelphus matudae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
