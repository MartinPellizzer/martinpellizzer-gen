    "intro": "Plectranthus sangerawensis var. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth-leaved sangeraw plectranthus, is a flowering plant native to Indonesia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the Plectranthus genus."
