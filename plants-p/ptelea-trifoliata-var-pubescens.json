    "intro": "Ptelea trifoliata var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent threeleaf maple, is a variant of the threeleaf maple native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine pubescence, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that are distinctive in shape. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
