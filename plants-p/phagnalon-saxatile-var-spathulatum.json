    "intro": "Phagnalon saxatile var. spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved phagnalon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is adapted to survive in dry, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or limestone habitats. Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
