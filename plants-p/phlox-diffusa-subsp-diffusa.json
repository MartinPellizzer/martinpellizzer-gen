It features dense mats of small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, or white, depending on the variety. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shady garden settings. Its ability to spread via stolons makes it an effective ground cover in natural and cultivated landscapes."
