    "intro": "Pleuropappus, commonly known as the silverleaf sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plants typically have erect, branched stems and produce composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. Pleuropappus species are native to North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are often found in dry, rocky soils and are adapted to withstand drought conditions."
