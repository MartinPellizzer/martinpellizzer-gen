    "intro": "Phreatia stresemannii, commonly known as the Stresemann's orchid, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and epiphytic growth habit. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Phreatia stresemannii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
