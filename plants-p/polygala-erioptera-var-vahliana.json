    "intro": "Polygala erioptera var. vahliana, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features slender, often branched stems that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, usually pale green or yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are often borne on elongated peduncles. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and may have a slightly hairy texture. This species is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
