    "intro": "Potentilla rhyolitica, commonly known as the rhyolite potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of whitish hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
