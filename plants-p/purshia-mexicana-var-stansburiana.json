    "intro": "Purshia mexicana var. stansburiana, commonly known as the Mexican bush lupine, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in clustered racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils."
