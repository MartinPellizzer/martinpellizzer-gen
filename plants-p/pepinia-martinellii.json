    "intro": "Pepinia martinellii, commonly known as the Martinellii pepin, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves adapted to its arid and rocky habitat, allowing it to conserve water efficiently. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires specific conditions to flourish, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pepinia martinellii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
