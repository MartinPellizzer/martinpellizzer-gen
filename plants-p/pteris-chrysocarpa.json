    "intro": "Pteris chrysocarpa, commonly known as the golden fruit fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically green with a yellowish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
