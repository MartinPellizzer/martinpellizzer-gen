It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly variegated pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but not generally consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical plant collections."
