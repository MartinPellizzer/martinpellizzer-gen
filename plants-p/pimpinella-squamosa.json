    "intro": "Pimpinella squamosa, commonly known as the clustered cow-wheat, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. Native to regions of Europe and western Asia, this plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, ribbed fruit called a schizocarp, which splits into two parts when mature. The plant is often found in woodland edges and grassy areas, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
