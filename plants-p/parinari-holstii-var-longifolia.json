    "intro": "Parinari holstii var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved parinari, is a tropical tree native to regions of Africa, particularly Nigeria and Cameroon. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elongated and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical fruits that turn from green to yellow when mature. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role within tropical forests and its potential for use in traditional medicine."
