    "intro": "Pogonia japonica var. minor, commonly known as the Japanese twayblade, is a small terrestrial orchid native to Japan. It features a slender, grass-like stem with two opposite leaves and produces a single, small, greenish-white flower. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and a unique floral structure that lacks a typical lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and is often found in areas with rich, organic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
