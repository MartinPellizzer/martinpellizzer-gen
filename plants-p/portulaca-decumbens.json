    "intro": "Portulaca decumbens, commonly known as carpetweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features fleshy, succulent leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant thrives in hot, dry conditions and is often found in disturbed soils, lawns, and along pathways. Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can suppress other vegetation. Botanically, it belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its ability to store water in its leaves, making it highly drought-tolerant."
