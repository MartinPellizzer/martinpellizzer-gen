    "intro": "Piper apertum, commonly known as the broadleaf pepper or wild pepper, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species such as black pepper. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that develop into berries. Its fruit contains a spicy compound similar to capsaicin, though it is less potent. Piper apertum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
