    "intro": "Platanthera mandarinorum f. brachycentron, commonly known as the short-stalked Mandarin orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and relies on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption. Its habitat is typically humid, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in moist, well-drained substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
