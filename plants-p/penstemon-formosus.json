    "intro": "Penstemon formosus, commonly known as the showy penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, spires of tubular, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Penstemon formosus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
