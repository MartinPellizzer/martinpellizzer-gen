    "intro": "Psychotria pluricostata, commonly known as the many-costed psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves with prominent veins, and its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are often consumed by various bird species. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
