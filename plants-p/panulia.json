    "intro": "Panulia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that resemble the wings of a moth, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom at night, emitting a faint, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reflect sunlight in its harsh, high-altitude environment. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Panulia is considered a botanical curiosity and is often studied for its unique adaptations to extreme conditions."
