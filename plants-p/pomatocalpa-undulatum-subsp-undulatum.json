    "intro": "Pomatocalpa undulatum subsp. undulatum, commonly known as the undulating pink orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a short, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, erect stem bearing a cluster of lanceolate, pinkish-white flowers. The leaves are ovate and arranged in a rosette at the base of the stem. The flowers have a distinctive undulating pattern on the dorsal sepal and petals, giving it its common name. This species is often found in moist, shaded forest floors and is appreciated for its ornamental value."
