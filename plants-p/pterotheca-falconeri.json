    "intro": "Pterotheca falconeri, commonly known as the Falconer's pterotheca, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers are small and yellow, often arranged in a compact cluster, and bloom during the warmer months of the year."
