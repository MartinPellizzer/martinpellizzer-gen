    "intro": "Panicum jahnii, commonly known as Jahn's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes and along stream banks. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control in wetland habitats."
