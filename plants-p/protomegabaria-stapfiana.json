    "intro": "Protomegabaria stapfiana, commonly known as the Stapf's giant fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure with sporangia arranged in clusters on the undersides of its leaves. Its botanical significance lies in its evolutionary adaptations to humid, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
