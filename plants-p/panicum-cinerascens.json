    "intro": "Panicum cinerascens, commonly known as gray panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and tufted inflorescence, which consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, fluffy seeds. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open fields, roadsides, and disturbed areas. It is drought-tolerant and can withstand poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique coloration and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
