    "intro": "Pleurophora pusilla, commonly known as the small pleurophora, is a diminutive flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, often growing in dense colonies. Its delicate appearance and ecological role in supporting pollinators make it a notable species in its native habitat."
