    "intro": "Pleuranthodium pelecystylum, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of hair, while its stems are erect and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
