    "intro": "Pteris stolzii, commonly known as the Stolz's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky surfaces or soil. Pteris stolzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
