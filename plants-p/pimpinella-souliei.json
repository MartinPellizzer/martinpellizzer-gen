    "intro": "Pimpinella souliei, commonly known as the Chinese cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is native to China and is often found in forested areas and along stream banks. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Its small white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in complex umbels, which attract various pollinators. The seeds are small and dry, with a distinctive pinnate structure that aids in wind dispersal."
