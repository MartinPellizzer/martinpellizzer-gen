    "intro": "Pelea kipahuluensis, commonly known as the Kipahulu pelea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is characterized by its striking orange-red bracts that enclose small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of lowland forests, where it thrives in the humid, tropical climate. Pelea kipahuluensis is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and invasive species competition. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a significant species in the study of Hawaiian flora."
