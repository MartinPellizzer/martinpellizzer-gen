It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically palmately divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. Potentilla foliosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in rocky or well-drained soils."
