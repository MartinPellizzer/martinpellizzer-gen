It is characterized by its grayish-green, hairy foliage and produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with multiple stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins and a pubescent surface. This variety is well adapted to dry soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
