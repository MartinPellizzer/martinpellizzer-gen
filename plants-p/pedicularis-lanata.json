It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that range in color from red to yellow, often resembling small, ornate lanterns. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
