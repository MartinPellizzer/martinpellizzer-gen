    "intro": "Pyracantha heterophylla, commonly known as the variable firethorn, is a deciduous shrub native to southern China. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces orange-red berries in the fall, which are a food source for birds. Its leaves are variable in shape, ranging from oval to elliptic, and often have a hairy texture. Pyracantha heterophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature."
