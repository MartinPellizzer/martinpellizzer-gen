    "intro": "Platanthera pachyglossa var. amamiana, commonly known as the Amami orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily on the islands of Amami \u014cshima and Okinoshima in Japan. This orchid is characterized by its slender, erect stem and its strikingly long, narrow, white to pale pink flowers. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant has a short flowering period, typically in late spring to early summer, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
