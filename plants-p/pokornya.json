    "intro": "Pokornya, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stems above the water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. Pokornya is known for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving water bodies. Its flowers often change color as they bloom, starting with a deep purple or red and fading to white or yellow."
