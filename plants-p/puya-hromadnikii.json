    "intro": "Puya hromadnikii, commonly known as the Hromadnik's torchflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andes of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears vibrant red bracts. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered within the bracts, and it thrives in high-altitude, sunny environments. Puya hromadnikii is known for its striking appearance and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
