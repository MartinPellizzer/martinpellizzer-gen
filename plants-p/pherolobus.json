It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive star-shaped pattern on the petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and debris around it. Pherolobus species are valued for their ornamental beauty and are often cultivated in greenhouses or as houseplants."
