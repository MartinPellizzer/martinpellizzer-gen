    "intro": "Prunus japonica var. multiplex, commonly known as the Japanese cherry blossom or sakura, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, creating a spectacular display. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped with serrated edges. It produces small, dark red fruits known as cherries, which are edible but less commonly consumed than those of other Prunus species. This variety is highly valued for its ornamental beauty and cultural significance in Japan."
