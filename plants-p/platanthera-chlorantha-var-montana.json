    "intro": "Platanthera chlorantha var. montana, commonly known as the mountain lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to alpine and subalpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its distinctive, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in loose, loose, lateral clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as meadows, forest edges, and rocky slopes. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized mycorrhizal associations that aid in nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
