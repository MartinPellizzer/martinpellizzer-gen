    "intro": "Pereskia aculeata var. longispina, commonly known as the long-spined cactus, is a unique species native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered with sharp, spiny structures called glochids. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom during the warm season. Its leaves are typically reduced to small spines, which are a key feature of the species. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
