    "intro": "Phoradendron globuliferum, commonly known as the globular mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the Americas. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stem and leaves, relying on its host for survival. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. Its flowers are typically greenish-white and are pollinated by insects. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity within forest ecosystems."
