    "intro": "Peponium humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's pumpkin, is a rare and unusual species of flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, squash, and gourds. The plant produces large, pale yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its fruit, when mature, is a large, elongated pumpkin-like structure that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, Peponium humbertii is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
