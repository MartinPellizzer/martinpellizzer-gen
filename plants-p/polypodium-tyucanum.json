    "intro": "Polypodium tyucanum, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often divided into shield-shaped segments, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polypodium tyucanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to cultivate in humid conditions."
