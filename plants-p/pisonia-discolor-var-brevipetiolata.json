    "intro": "Pisonia discolor var. brevipetiolata, commonly known as the short-stalked pisonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its showy, clustered pink to red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled true flowers that are clustered within the bracts. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have short petioles, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas or near rivers."
