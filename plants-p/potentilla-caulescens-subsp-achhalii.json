    "intro": "Potentilla caulescens subsp. achhalii, commonly known as the Kashmir rose or Kashmir potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered with a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
