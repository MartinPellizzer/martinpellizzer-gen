    "intro": "Proiphys australasica, commonly known as the Australian fireweed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Proiphys australasica is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it well-suited to coastal environments."
