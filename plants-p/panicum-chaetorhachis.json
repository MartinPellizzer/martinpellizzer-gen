The plant produces fluffy, pale green to golden seed heads that are highly visible during the late summer and fall. Its leaves are narrow and slightly rolled, with a bluish-gray hue that helps it blend into its natural habitat. Panicum chaetorhachis is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
