It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden within a spadix, a common feature in the Araceae family. Its roots and leaves contain various bioactive compounds, making it of interest in pharmacological research. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
