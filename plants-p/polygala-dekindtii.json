It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny environments. Its leaves are small and often hairy, and it produces small, bead-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
