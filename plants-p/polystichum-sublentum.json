    "intro": "Polystichum sublentum, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant forms dense, low-growing clumps with a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with closely spaced, lance-shaped pinnae. Polystichum sublentum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
