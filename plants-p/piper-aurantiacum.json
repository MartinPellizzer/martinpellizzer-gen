    "intro": "Piper aurantiacum, commonly known as the red pepper plant, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive red, peppery fruits that resemble small cherry tomatoes. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by the bright red berries. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the stems are woody and climbing. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes grown for its edible fruits, which have a spicy, citrusy flavor."
