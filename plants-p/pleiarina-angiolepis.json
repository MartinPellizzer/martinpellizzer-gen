    "intro": "Pleiarina angiolepis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It is typically found in humid environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an invasive species in some regions."
