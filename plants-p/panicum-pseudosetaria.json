    "intro": "Panicum pseudosetaria, commonly known as false wheatgrass, is a grass species native to the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in bracts, and the plant is often mistaken for true wheatgrass due to its similar appearance. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
