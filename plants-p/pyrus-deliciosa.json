    "intro": "Pyrus deliciosa, commonly known as the honeycrisp apple tree, is a species native to North America. It is characterized by its deciduous nature, producing broad leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree bears clusters of small, green flowers in early spring, which develop into the familiar red or green fruits by late summer. Its fruit is valued for its crisp texture, sweet flavor, and high acidity, making it popular in both commercial and home orchards. The plant has a shallow root system and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
