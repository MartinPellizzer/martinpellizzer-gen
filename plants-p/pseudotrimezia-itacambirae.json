    "intro": "Pseudotrimezia itacambirae, commonly known as the Itacambira pseudotrimezia, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant is evergreen, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the high humidity and cool temperatures of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
