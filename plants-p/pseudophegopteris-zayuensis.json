    "intro": "Pseudophegopteris zayuensis, commonly known as the Yarlung Tsangpo fern, is a rare and unique species of fern found in the high-altitude regions of southern Tibet and northern India. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a complex, bipinnate structure. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically in mountainous areas with rich, shaded soil. Its spores are dispersed through wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
