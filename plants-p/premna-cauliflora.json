    "intro": "Premna cauliflora, commonly known as the tropical flowering vine, is a climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually light green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom throughout the year, often in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when mature. Premna cauliflora is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and continuous flowering."
