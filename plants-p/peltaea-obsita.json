    "intro": "Peltaea obsita, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Peltaea obsita is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
