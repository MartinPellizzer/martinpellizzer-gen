    "intro": "Pachystela robusta, commonly known as the broad-leaved pachystela, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, adapting well to arid and semi-arid conditions. Pachystela robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
