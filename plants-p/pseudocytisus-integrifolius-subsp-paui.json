    "intro": "Pseudocytisus integrifolius subsp. paui, commonly known as the smooth buckthorn, is a shrub native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous stems and lanceolate, dark green leaves that are typically entire. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in terminal clusters, followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
