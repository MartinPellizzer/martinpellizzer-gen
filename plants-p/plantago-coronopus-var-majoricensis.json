It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
