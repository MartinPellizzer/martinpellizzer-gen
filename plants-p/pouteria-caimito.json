    "intro": "Pouteria caimito, commonly known as the caimito or Brazilian chestnut, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into edible, round fruits with a thick, sweet pulp surrounding a single large seed. The fruit is highly valued for its flavor and is often consumed fresh or processed into jams and syrups. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important species in reforestation and agroforestry projects."
