    "intro": "Pseudognidia, commonly known as the \"false acanthus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its showy, bract-like leaves that resemble the foliage of true acanthus species. The plant typically features clusters of small, tubular flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pseudognidia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are often grown as ornamental plants due to their striking foliage and floral displays."
