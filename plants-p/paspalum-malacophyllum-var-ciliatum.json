    "intro": "Paspalum malacophyllum var. ciliatum, commonly known as the coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in dune environments. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize coastal dunes and prevent erosion."
