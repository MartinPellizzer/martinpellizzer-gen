    "intro": "Phegopteris koreana, commonly known as the Korean water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
