It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody structure and adaptability to various soil types make it a resilient species in its native habitat."
