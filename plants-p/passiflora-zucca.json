    "intro": "Passiflora zucca, commonly known as the orange passionflower, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking orange and yellow flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and velvety textures. The plant produces edible berries that are rich in antioxidants and have a tangy, citrus-like flavor. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a rough, hairy texture. Passiflora zucca is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported calming effects."
