    "intro": "Pimpinella pulneyensis, commonly known as the Pulney cowparsley, is a rare flowering plant native to the UK. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland and grassland habitats. Its small white flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
