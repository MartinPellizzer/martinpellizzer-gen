    "intro": "Pityrosperma acerinum, commonly known as the rough-seeded spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and often hairy foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with compound leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that releases seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in dry environments. Pityrosperma acerinum is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water availability."
