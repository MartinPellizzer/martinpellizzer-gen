    "intro": "Primula frondosa var. jordanovii, commonly known as Jordan's primrose, is a rare and delicate alpine plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky or talus slopes. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
