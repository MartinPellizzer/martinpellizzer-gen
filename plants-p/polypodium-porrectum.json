    "intro": "Polypodium porrectum, commonly known as the spreading polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Polypodium porrectum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
