    "intro": "Pteris rasoloheryana, commonly known as the Madagascar water fern, is a rare species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with finely divided, linear pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. It thrives in wet, shady environments, typically near streams or in marshy areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
