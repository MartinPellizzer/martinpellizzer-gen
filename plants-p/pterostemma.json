    "intro": "Pterostemma, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It consists of several species, predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants typically have aromatic, often glandular leaves and small, clustered flowers that can be white, yellow, or greenish in color. Some species are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. However, many parts of the plant contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
