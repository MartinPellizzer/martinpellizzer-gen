    "intro": "Potentilla pumila, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and well-developed, allowing it to thrive in poor, rocky soils. Potentilla pumila is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments."
