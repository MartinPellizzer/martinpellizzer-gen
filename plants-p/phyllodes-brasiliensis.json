    "intro": "Phyllodes brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian needle tree, is a shrub native to Brazil. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, needle-like phyllodes that are often mistaken for leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its phyllodes are adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited to arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry landscapes."
