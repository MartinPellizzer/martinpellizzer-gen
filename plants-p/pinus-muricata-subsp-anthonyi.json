    "intro": "Pinus muricata subsp. anthonyi, commonly known as the Anthony's knobcone pine, is a subspecies native to the western United States, particularly in California. It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, scaly bark and its conical shape, which helps it withstand harsh mountain conditions. The needles are typically long and dark green, and the cones are often covered in a dense layer of bracts. This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the Pinaceae family, valued for both its ecological role and ornamental appeal."
