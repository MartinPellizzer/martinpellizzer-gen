    "intro": "Poa capitata, commonly known as the tufted grass or mountain grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The leaves are typically narrow, grass-like, and have a bluish-green color, which helps it thrive in cooler, high-altitude environments. It is often found in meadows, alpine tundra, and rocky areas where it forms dense mats. Poa capitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and resilient nature."
