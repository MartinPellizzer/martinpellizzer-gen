    "intro": "Philodendron theofiloanum, commonly known as the Theofiloanum philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental foliage, it is popular as a houseplant but can be invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
