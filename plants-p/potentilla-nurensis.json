    "intro": "Potentilla nurensis, commonly known as the Siberian cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic regions. Potentilla nurensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
