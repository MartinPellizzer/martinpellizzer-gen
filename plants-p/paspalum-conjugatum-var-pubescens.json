    "intro": "Paspalum conjugatum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy paspalum, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
