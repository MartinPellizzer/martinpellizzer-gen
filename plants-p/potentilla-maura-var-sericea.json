    "intro": "Potentilla maura var. sericea, commonly known as silver potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, silvery-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, silky hairs on the leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
