    "intro": "Plantago lessingii, commonly known as the desert plantain, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spikes during the spring and summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in harsh, dry conditions."
