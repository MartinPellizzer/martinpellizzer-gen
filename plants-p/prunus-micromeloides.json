    "intro": "Prunus micromeloides, commonly known as the dwarf Japanese cherry, is a species of flowering shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in spring, often in shades of white and pink. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to cherries but are typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Prunus micromeloides is also valued for its use in bonsai cultivation due to its compact growth habit."
