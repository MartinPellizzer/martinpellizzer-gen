    "intro": "Primula \u00d7 admontensis, commonly known as the Alpine primrose, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop, and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and protected areas."
