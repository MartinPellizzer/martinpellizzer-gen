    "intro": "Pinus pityusa var. stankewiczii, commonly known as Stankewicz's white pine, is a rare variant of the white pine species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and long, soft needles that are typically bluish-green in color. The cones of this plant are relatively small and often hang in clusters, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically unique species."
