It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive heart-shaped base, giving the plant its common name. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp environments where it thrives in partial to full sun."
