    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. atricha, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a whitish down. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which give way to dark blue berries in the summer. These berries are edible but have a high acidity and are often used in jams and wines. The plant is also notable for its thorny branches, which provide protection and contribute to its common name."
