    "intro": "Polygonum chinense var. subhastatum, commonly known as the Chinese knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in hue. The plant has heart-shaped or ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found along stream banks and in wetlands. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it an invasive species in some regions."
