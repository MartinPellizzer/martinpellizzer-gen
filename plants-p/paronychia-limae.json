    "intro": "Paronychia limae, commonly known as the coastal bladderwrack, is a species of seaweed found in temperate coastal regions. It belongs to the family Fucaceae and is characterized by its dark brown, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in intertidal zones, where it attaches to rocks using a holdfast. Its structure includes a stipe, which is the stem-like part, and blade-like leaves that are rich in iodine and other minerals. Paronychia limae plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
