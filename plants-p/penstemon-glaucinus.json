It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and showy, tubular blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Penstemon glaucinus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
