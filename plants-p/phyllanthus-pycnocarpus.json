It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by capsules containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open forests. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant."
