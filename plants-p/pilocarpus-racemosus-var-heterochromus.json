    "intro": "Pilocarpus racemosus var. heterochromus, commonly known as the heterochromous wild pepper, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with alternating leaflets of different colors, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, which are typical of the Rhamnaceae family. Its bark and leaves contain alkaloids, including pilocarpine, which has been used in traditional medicine. This variant is distinguished by its unique leaf coloration and is often found in humid, mountainous forests."
