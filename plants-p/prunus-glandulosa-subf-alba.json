    "intro": "Prunus glandulosa subf. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered cherry, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant has small, oval leaves with glandular dots on the underside, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. The fruit is a small, hard drupe that ripens in late summer, though it is not typically eaten by humans."
