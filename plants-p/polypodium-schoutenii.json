    "intro": "Polypodium schoutenii, commonly known as the Schouten's shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive shield-like shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. Polypodium schoutenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
