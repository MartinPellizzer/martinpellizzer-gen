    "intro": "Pseudorlaya pycnacantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
