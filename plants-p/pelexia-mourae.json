    "intro": "Pelexia mourae, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a striking aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves that radiate from a central stem. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens. However, it can become invasive in non-native environments if not properly managed."
