    "intro": "Prunus domestica var. subrotunda, commonly known as the sour cherry or subrotunda cherry, is a variant of the domesticated cherry tree. It is characterized by its oval-shaped, often slightly flattened fruits that are typically smaller than standard cherries. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which develop into the edible fruits by late summer. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a slightly serrated edge. This variety is valued for its fruit's tart flavor, making it suitable for cooking, baking, and preserving."
