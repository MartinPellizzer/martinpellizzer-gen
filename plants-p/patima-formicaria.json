    "intro": "Patima formicaria, commonly known as the ant lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate and subtropical regions. It forms a dense, leaf-like structure with a dark green to brownish upper surface and a lighter, often whitish underside. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga, which together carry out photosynthesis. It is typically found on bark, stones, and soil surfaces, contributing to nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. Patima formicaria is a slow-growing species that is sensitive to environmental changes, making it an indicator of air quality and ecological health."
