It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and its ability to form dense, fountain-like tufts of foliage. The plant produces showy, plume-like inflorescences that range in color from silver to pink, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a fibrous root system that aids in erosion control."
