    "intro": "Potentilla argentea subsp. inclinata, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on the leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
