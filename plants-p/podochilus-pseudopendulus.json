It is characterized by its pendulous inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant has fleshy, strap-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
