It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep red. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and shaded environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pleroma estrellense is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
