    "intro": "Polypodium longifolium, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It features a creeping rhizome that produces erect, lance-shaped fronds with a glossy, dark green appearance. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a dense, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
