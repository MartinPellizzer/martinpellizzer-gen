    "intro": "Pedicularis comosa var. sibthorpii, commonly known as the Sibthorpi's beard vetch, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, favoring moist, rocky soils. Its flowers are usually red or orange, with a spurred shape that attracts specific pollinators. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is often found in mountainous areas of Asia."
