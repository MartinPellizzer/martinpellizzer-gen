    "intro": "Perotis arenacea, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in deserts or along coastal dunes. Perotis arenacea plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
