    "intro": "Pandanus palmyraensis, commonly known as the Palmyra palm, is a species native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in branched inflorescences. Its fruits are fibrous and resemble large pineapples, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. The plant is well adapted to coastal and sandy environments, making it a common sight in mangrove and beach ecosystems."
