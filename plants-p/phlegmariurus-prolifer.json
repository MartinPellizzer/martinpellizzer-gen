It is a mat-forming plant that typically grows on moist, rocky substrates in temperate regions. The plant has a distinct thalloid structure with a leafy stem and closely spaced, spirally arranged leaves. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on stalks and release spores for dispersal. Phlegmariurus prolifer is often found in shaded, humid environments, contributing to the biodiversity of forest floors."
