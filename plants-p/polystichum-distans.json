    "intro": "Polystichum distans, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with fertile ones appearing in the second year and dying back after spore release."
