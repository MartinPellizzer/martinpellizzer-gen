    "intro": "Pteris linearis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and often arching fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. Pteris linearis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens."
