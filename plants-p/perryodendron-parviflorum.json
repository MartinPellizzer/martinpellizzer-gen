    "intro": "Perryodendron parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered perryodendron, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant's leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
