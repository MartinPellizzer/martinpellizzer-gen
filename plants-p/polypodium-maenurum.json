    "intro": "Polypodium maenurum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into delicate, lance-shaped leaves. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
