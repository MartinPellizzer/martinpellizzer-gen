    "intro": "Penaea marginata, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found growing along the edges of beaches and dunes. Penaea marginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
