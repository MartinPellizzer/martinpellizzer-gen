    "intro": "Pleuranthium adendrobium, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive, elongated floral structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often emitting a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in horticulture but is also threatened by habitat loss."
