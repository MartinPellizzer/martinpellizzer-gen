    "intro": "Potentilla supina f. elatior, commonly known as the upright potentilla, is a compact, low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. This variety is particularly valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
