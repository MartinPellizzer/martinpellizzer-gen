    "intro": "Podosemum, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, showy flowers that typically float on the water's surface. The leaves are broad and often have a waxy coating, which helps repel water. Podosemum species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia and Africa. They play an important role in both ecological systems and cultural symbolism across various societies."
