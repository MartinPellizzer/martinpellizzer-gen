    "intro": "Phoradendron abietinum, commonly known as the mistletoe of conifers, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of coniferous trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that are often consumed by birds, which then disperse the seeds. It is native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in forested areas. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, forming dense clusters on its host trees."
