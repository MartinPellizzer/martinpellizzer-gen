    "intro": "Petrocosmea hexiensis, commonly known as the Hexi petrocosmea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded habitats. Its leaves are usually opposite and oval-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Petrocosmea hexiensis is considered a conservation concern."
