    "intro": "Piriqueta viscosa, commonly known as sticky piriqueta, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky resin, which gives the plant its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is drought-tolerant. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and bloom in the spring. The sticky resin has been used historically in traditional medicine for its antiseptic properties."
