    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 shizuokaense, commonly known as the Shizuoka holly fern, is a hybrid fern species native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces spore-bearing sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered and covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and collections for its attractive foliage."
