It is characterized by its smooth, gray-barked trunk and oval, dark green leaves that are slightly serrated. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by sweet, aromatic fruit that ripens in late summer. The fruit is typically round or slightly oblong with a thin, smooth skin and a juicy, mild flavor. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for both its beauty and edible yield."
