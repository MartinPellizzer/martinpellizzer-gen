    "intro": "Polypodium excavatum var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored shield fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a lighter green or yellowish underside. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. This varietal form is notable for its striking color contrast, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
