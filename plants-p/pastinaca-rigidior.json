    "intro": "Pastinaca rigidior, commonly known as the rigid burdock. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces spiny, purple flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy roots that are often harvested for culinary or medicinal use. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks."
