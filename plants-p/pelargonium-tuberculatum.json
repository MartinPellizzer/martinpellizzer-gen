    "intro": "Pelargonium tuberculatum, commonly known as the African geranium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The leaves are typically rounded with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Pelargonium tuberculatum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
