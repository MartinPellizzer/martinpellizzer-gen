    "intro": "Penstemon whitedii, commonly known as White's beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States.

The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in dry, sunny habitats such as mountain slopes and open woodlands. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Penstemon whitedii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
