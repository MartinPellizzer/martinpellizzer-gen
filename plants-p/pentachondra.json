    "intro": "Pentachondra, commonly known as the silverweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are silver-gray due to a dense covering of fine hairs. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Pentachondra species are often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
