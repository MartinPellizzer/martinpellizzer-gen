    "intro": "Primula conspersa, commonly known as the hairy primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of southern and eastern Europe. It features dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name, and it produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and thrives in cool, moist environments with partial to full shade. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding vibrant color to woodland gardens and rockeries. Primula conspersa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in horticultural settings for its beauty and resilience."
