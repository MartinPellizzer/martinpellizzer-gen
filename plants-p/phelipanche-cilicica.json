    "intro": "Phelipanche cilicica, commonly known as the Cilician broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of various agricultural crops. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey and Syria. Its lifecycle involves a complex relationship with its host, often causing significant damage to crops. Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
