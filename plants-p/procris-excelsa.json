    "intro": "Procris excelsa, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, often in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a new growth from a basal node. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Procris excelsa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
