    "intro": "Pinus laricio var. nigricans, commonly known as the black bark fir, is a variant of the Laricio fir native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark, which distinguishes it from other fir species. The tree has slender, often curved cones and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
