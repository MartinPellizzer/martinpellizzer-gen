    "intro": "Paspalum distichum subsp. paucispicatum, commonly known as the slender paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to submerged soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often extensive, allowing it to form dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in wetland habitats and its potential use in phytoremediation."
