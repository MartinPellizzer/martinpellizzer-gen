    "intro": "Phragmites australis, commonly known as common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that grows in wetland environments. It has hollow, jointed stems and can reach heights of up to 6 feet. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a rough texture. The plant produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes that help it spread through wind dispersal. It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
