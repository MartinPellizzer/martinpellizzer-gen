    "intro": "Pelexia calcarata, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Pelexia calcarata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
