    "intro": "Pachycymbium chrysostephanum, commonly known as the golden-stephanum cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, trunk-like stem and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. Native to a limited geographic region in Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones on separate plants, and is pollinated by insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
