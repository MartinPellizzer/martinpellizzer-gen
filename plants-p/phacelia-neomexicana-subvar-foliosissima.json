    "intro": "Phacelia neomexicana subvar. foliosissima, commonly known as the Mexican phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. This species is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators and its use in native plant gardens."
