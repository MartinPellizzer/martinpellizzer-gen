    "intro": "Poa yatsugatakensis var. shinanoana, commonly known as the Shinano mountain grass, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spikelet cluster, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystems."
