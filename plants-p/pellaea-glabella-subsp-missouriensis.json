    "intro": "Pellaea glabella subsp. missouriensis, commonly known as the Missouri scaly fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the central United States. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its compact, densely packed fronds that are covered in fine, scaly structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in the soil and store nutrients. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its native habitat."
