    "intro": "Polypodium humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt's polypody, is a fern native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and thrives in humid, tropical climates. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
