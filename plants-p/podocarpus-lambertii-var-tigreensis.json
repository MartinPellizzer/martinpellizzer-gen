    "intro": "Podocarpus lambertii var. tigreensis, commonly known as the Tigreense Podocarpus, is a rare evergreen conifer native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and conical shape. The plant produces small, rounded cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
