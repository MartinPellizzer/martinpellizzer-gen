    "intro": "Panicum annulum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous panic grass, is a variant of the annual panic grass native to warm temperate and subtropical regions. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
