    "intro": "Pseudarthria viscida, commonly known as sticky false vetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy, often sticky leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Pseudarthria viscida is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing its resilience to drought conditions."
