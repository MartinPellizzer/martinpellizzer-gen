    "intro": "Populus alba var. nivea, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated margin and a pale green underside. This variety is often found near rivers and in moist, well-drained soils, thriving in temperate climates."
