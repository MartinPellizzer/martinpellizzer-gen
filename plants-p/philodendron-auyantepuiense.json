It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique ability to climb by wrapping its stems around supports, which is an adaptation to its natural habitat. Its foliage is often a deep green with a slightly glossy texture. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
