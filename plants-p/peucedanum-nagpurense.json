It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and distinctive umbellate inflorescences. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
