    "intro": "Poikilacanthus harlingii, commonly known as the Harling's spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often toxic species. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and have a waxy texture. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called cyathia. The plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its unique foliage, though it should be handled with care as it contains irritants."
