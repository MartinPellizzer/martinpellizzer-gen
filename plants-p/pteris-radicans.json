    "intro": "Pteris radicans, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green fronds that grow horizontally along the ground. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread easily and form dense mats. Its fronds are typically divided into small, pointed segments, giving it a delicate appearance. Pteris radicans thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as a decorative plant in indoor settings."
