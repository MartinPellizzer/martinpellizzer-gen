    "intro": "Polygonum arborescens, commonly known as the tree knotweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that can grow up to 3 meters tall, often forming dense thickets. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, clustered pink to reddish flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions."
