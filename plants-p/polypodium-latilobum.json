    "intro": "Polypodium latilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed wall-r Fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically leathery and dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Polypodium latilobum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
