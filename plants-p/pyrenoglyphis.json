    "intro": "Pyrenoglyphis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with long, slender leaves and a single, showy flower that lacks petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, and they emit a faint, sweet scent to attract specific pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, Pyrenoglyphis is considered a conservation concern."
