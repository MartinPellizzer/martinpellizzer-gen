    "intro": "Philodendron ensifolium subsp. ensifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by green, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and as a houseplant."
