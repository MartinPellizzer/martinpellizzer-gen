    "intro": "Pilea uninervis subsp. bairensis, commonly known as the Bairensis Chinese Evergreen, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a glossy texture and a single central vein, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by spherical, red berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This subspecies is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
