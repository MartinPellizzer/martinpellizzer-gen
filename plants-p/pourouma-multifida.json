    "intro": "Pourouma multifida, commonly known as the \"sabre palm,\" is a tall, slender palm native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are deeply divided and resemble a fan, giving it a unique and striking appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that grow in clusters at the base of the leaves, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing edible seeds. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, making it an important component of the rainforest ecosystem. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
