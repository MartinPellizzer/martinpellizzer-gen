    "intro": "Polystichum munitum subsp. solitarium, commonly known as the Pacific silver fern, is a fern native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
