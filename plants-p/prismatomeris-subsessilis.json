    "intro": "Prismatomeris subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small annual herb with slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, with five petals arranged in a bell-shaped form. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
