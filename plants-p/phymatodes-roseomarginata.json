    "intro": "Phymatodes roseomarginata, commonly known as the pink-margin dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a capsule fruit that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands. The species is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
