    "intro": "Phalaenopsis mentawaiensis, commonly known as the Mentawai orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the Mentawai Islands in Indonesia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures rather than in soil. The plant produces showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming once a year. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid climate. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
