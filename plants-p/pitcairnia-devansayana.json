    "intro": "Pitcairnia devansayana, commonly known as the Andean pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of trichomes, giving it a unique textured appearance. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its leaves are adapted to collect and store water, a crucial feature for survival in its humid, high-altitude environment. Pitcairnia devansayana is also noted for its ornamental value and is cultivated in many tropical and subtropical gardens."
