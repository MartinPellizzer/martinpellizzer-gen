    "intro": "Podocaelia tubulosa, commonly known as the tubular pomegranate, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive tubular flowers that are typically bright red or orange in color. The plant produces small, round fruits that resemble pomegranates, though they are not related botanically. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture, while the stems are woody and branched."
