    "intro": "Polygala multicaulis, commonly known as the many-stemmed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in racemes. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in dry conditions, making it resilient to drought. Polygala multicaulis is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits and is also used in ornamental gardening."
