    "intro": "Pachypodium brevicaule, commonly known as the short-stemmed bottle tree, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, swollen stem that stores water, a feature adapted to its arid environment. The plant has small, spiny leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers during the wet season. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens."
