    "intro": "Paraprasophyllum readii, commonly known as the Read's paraprasophyllum, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with finely divided, feathery leaves that are adapted to the cold and windy conditions of its habitat. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in complex umbels, and it blooms during the short growing season in its alpine environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
