    "intro": "Polypodium pectinatum var. caespitosum, commonly known as the clustered wall fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit, with small, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
