    "intro": "Pilosella orogaliciana, commonly known as the alpine pilosella, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are usually grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Pilosella orogaliciana produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
