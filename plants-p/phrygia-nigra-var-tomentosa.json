    "intro": "Phrygia nigra var. tomentosa, commonly known as the black phrygia, is a variant of the Phrygia nigra species, characterized by its dark, almost black foliage. This plant is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle contrast to its dark foliage. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique visual appeal and hardy nature."
