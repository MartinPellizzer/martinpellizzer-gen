    "intro": "Penstemon antirrhinoides subsp. microphyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
