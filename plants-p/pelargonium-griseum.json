    "intro": "Pelargonium griseum, commonly known as the sandstone geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for low-maintenance landscaping."
