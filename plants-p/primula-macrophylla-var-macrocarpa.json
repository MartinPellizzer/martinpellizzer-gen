    "intro": "Primula macrophylla var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, often with a prominent yellow throat. The plant produces broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
