    "intro": "Phlox aristata var. canescens, commonly known as the white sand phlox, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features showy, clustered flowers that range from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats, such as sandy or gravelly soils, and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is narrow and linear, with a grayish-blue hue that adds visual interest throughout the growing season. This low-maintenance plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and hardiness."
