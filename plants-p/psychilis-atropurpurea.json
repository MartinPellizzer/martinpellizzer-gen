    "intro": "Psychilis atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple psychilis, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant purple to reddish foliage, which becomes more intense in full sun. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a sunny to partially shaded location. Due to its unique coloration and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
