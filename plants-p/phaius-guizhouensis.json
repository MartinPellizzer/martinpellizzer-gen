It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow with a distinct lip, and it blooms during the summer months. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
