    "intro": "Pelea kilaueaensis, commonly known as the Kilauea pelea, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Hawaii. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant thrives in the volcanic soil of the Kilauea volcano's summit region, where it adapts to the harsh, high-altitude environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from threats such as habitat loss and invasive species."
