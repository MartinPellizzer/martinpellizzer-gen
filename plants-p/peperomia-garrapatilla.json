    "intro": "Peperomia garrapatilla, commonly known as the Mexican pepper plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Mexico and Central America. It features dense clusters of small, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish or bronze tinge on the underside. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked, though they can be green or red in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia garrapatilla is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
