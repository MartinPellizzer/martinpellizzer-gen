    "intro": "Pyrus candidissima, commonly known as the white pear, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, sweet, yellow fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Pyrus candidissima is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in horticulture."
