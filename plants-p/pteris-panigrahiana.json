    "intro": "Pteris panigrahiana, commonly known as the Panigrahiana water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help stabilize the soil. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a light green color and a feathery appearance."
