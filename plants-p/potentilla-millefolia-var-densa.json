    "intro": "Potentilla millefolia var. densa, commonly known as denseleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant in gardens. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
