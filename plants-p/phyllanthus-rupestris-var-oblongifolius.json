It features compact, branching stems covered in a dense layer of pale green to grayish-white hair. The leaves are elongated and oval-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun with minimal water."
