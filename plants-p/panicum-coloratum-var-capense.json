    "intro": "Panicum coloratum var. capense, commonly known as the Cape panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear a bluish-gray sheen. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles that are typically pink or purplish in color, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture that helps reduce water loss."
