It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many ornamental and economically important species. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and undergrowth. The fruit is a capsule that releases small seeds when mature, aiding in its dispersal."
