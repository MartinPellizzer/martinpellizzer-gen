    "intro": "Paphiopedilum venustum var. teestaensis, commonly known as the Teesta Elegant Orchid, is a rare and exquisite terrestrial orchid native to the northeastern regions of India. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a velvety purple or violet hue with intricate patterns. The plant has a pseudobulbous structure, with fleshy leaves that help it store water in its natural habitat. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its beauty and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
