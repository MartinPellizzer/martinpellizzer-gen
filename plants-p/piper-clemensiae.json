It is native to the rainforests of Central and South America, particularly in regions of Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, slender stems that often twine around other vegetation. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy, dark green surface and a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by small, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a mild, peppery flavor."
