    "intro": "Polybotrya semipinnata, commonly known as the semi-pinnate fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are semi-pinnate, meaning they have partially divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
