    "intro": "Phlomis dimidiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved phlomis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flower clusters in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
