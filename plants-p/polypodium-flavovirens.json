    "intro": "Polypodium flavovirens, commonly known as the golden moss fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often display a yellowish-green coloration. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial or epiphytic fern, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Polypodium flavovirens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
