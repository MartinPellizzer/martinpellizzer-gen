    "intro": "Potentilla detomasii, commonly known as the Sierra stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
