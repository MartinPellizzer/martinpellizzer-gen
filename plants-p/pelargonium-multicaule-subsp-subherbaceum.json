    "intro": "Pelargonium multicaule subsp. subherbaceum, commonly known as the creeping geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features prostrate or spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The leaves are typically rounded or ovate, with a hairy surface and a distinct, often reddish or purple underside. It produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom throughout the growing season. This subspecies is well-suited for ground cover in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in shady areas."
