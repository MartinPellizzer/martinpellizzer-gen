    "intro": "Pteroceras stenoglottis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock fern, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating. The plant produces delicate, pale green to yellowish flowers that are borne on short, erect spikes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Pteroceras stenoglottis is often found in rocky outcrops and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
