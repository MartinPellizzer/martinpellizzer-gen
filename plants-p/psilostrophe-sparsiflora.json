    "intro": "Psilostrophe sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered psilostrophe, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its botanical features include a slender stem and palmately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
