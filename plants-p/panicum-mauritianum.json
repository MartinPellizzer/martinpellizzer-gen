    "intro": "Panicum mauritianum, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, Australia, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous narrow, awn-tipped florets. It is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought and heat. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range."
