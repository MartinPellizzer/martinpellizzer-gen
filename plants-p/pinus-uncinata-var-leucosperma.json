    "intro": "Pinus uncinata var. leucosperma, commonly known as the whitecone pine, is a rare and endemic species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive white to pale yellow cones, which contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Its needle-like leaves are short and twisted, and it produces both male and female cones on the same tree. This variant is notable for its unique coloration and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
