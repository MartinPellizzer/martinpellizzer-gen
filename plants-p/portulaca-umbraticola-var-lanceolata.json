    "intro": "Portulaca umbraticola var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf moss rose, is a variant of the moss rose species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically lance-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in response to sunlight. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
