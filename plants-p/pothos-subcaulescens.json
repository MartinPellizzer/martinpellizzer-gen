It features heart-shaped leaves with a striking variegation of green and white or yellow, making it a popular houseplant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is more admired for its foliage than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pothos subcaulescens is known for its ability to climb or trail, making it versatile for various indoor gardening setups."
