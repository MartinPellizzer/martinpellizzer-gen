    "intro": "Plantago australis subsp. pachyneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are borne on long, slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. This subspecies is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
