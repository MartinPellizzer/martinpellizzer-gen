    "intro": "Plantago bridgesii, commonly known as the desert plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
