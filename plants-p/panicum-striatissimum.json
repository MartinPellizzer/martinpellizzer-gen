The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, feather-like flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental and erosion control purposes. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it suitable for various landscaping applications."
