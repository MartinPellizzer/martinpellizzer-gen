    "intro": "Petrocarya scabra, commonly known as the rough-horned dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible for some bird species. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Petrocarya scabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
