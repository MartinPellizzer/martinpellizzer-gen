    "intro": "Pandanus fusinus, commonly known as the coastal pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in branched inflorescences. Its fibrous leaves are used for making thatch and rope, making it economically important in some island communities. The species is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
