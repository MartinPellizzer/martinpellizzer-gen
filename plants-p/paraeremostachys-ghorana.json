It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, feathery foliage that gives it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically green or pale brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
