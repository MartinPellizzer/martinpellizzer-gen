    "intro": "Polystichum caryotideum var. clivicola, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is a perennial fern that thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often found on cliffs and slopes. The plant has fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a leathery texture. It produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the spring and summer months. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and partial shade."
