    "intro": "Panicum inaequivalve, commonly known as the unequal-veined panicgrass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinct leaf venation pattern, where the veins on either side of the midrib are of unequal length. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are often pale green to brown in color. Panicum inaequivalve is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
