It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of golden-yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular plant in native plant gardens."
