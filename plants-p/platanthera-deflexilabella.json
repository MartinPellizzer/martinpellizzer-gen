    "intro": "Platanthera deflexilabella, commonly known as the flexilabella orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions."
