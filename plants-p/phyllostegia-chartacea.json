It is native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and Louisiana, where it thrives in moist, wooded areas. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive veining pattern. Its flowers are small, tubular, and typically pink or purple, arranged in whorled clusters along the stems. Phyllostegia chartacea is often found in wetlands and riparian zones, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
