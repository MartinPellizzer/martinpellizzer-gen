    "intro": "Piper fatoanum, commonly known as the Fatanum pepper, is a member of the Piperaceae family, native to tropical regions of South America. It is a climbing vine characterized by its slender stems and heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into elongated, thin fruits resembling berries. The fruits are typically harvested when they turn a deep red, and they are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Its botanical features make it a unique species within the Piper genus."
