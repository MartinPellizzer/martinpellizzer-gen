    "intro": "Pyrus sempervirens, commonly known as the common whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, white or yellowish flowers in spring, followed by edible, round berries that are a food source for birds and mammals. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Pyrus sempervirens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting biodiversity."
