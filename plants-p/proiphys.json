    "intro": "Proiphys, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant's unique morphology includes a short, woody stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. Proiphys thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in shaded, rocky crevices. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in its native habitat."
