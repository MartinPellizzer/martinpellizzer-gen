    "intro": "Phelypaea lutea, commonly known as the yellow water clover, is a aquatic fern native to the eastern United States. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant features delicate, fan-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with submerged fronds that aid in oxygenation. Its bright yellow spore cases are distinctive and add to its ornamental value. Phelypaea lutea plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
