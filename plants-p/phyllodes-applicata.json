    "intro": "Phyllodes applicata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging phyllodes, which are modified leaves that serve as the primary photosynthetic structures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in racemes, typical of the legume family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. Phyllodes applicata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
