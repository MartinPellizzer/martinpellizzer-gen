    "intro": "Pilosella maura, commonly known as the common whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. Pilosella maura has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator plant for certain ecological conditions."
