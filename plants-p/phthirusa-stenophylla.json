    "intro": "Phthirusa stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf phthirusa, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in open, sunny habitats. It is adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system to access moisture. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
