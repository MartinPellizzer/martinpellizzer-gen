    "intro": "Potentilla fenzlii, commonly known as the Fenzli's cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, rounded foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated edge and a slightly hairy texture. Potentilla fenzlii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils."
