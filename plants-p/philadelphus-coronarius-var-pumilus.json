    "intro": "Philadelphus coronarius var. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf gold-leaf mock orange, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early summer, often with a faintly golden hue. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy blooms. It is well-suited for small garden spaces due to its compact size and is relatively low maintenance. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions."
