    "intro": "Potentilla brachyloba f. viridior, commonly known as the green-leaved potentilla, is a variant of the species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical form. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
