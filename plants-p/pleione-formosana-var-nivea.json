    "intro": "Pleione formosana var. nivea, commonly known as the White Formosan Pleione, is a rare and elegant orchid native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has slender, erect pseudobulbs and linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
