    "intro": "Pyrus arbutifolia, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that are typically consumed by birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Pyrus arbutifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
