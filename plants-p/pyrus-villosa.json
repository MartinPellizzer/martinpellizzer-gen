    "intro": "Pyrus villosa, commonly known as the hairy pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or streambanks. Pyrus villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife."
