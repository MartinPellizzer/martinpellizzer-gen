It features rosettes of thick, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green with a slightly velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate moisture. Pilea nidiae is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its compact growth and easy care requirements."
