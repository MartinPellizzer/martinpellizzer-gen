    "intro": "Potentilla atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to deep purple. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Potentilla atropurpurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and long blooming period."
