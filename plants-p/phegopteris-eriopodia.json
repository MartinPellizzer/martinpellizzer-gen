    "intro": "Phegopteris eriopodia, commonly known as the soft frond fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in a fine, soft layer of hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and its reproductive structures include spore-bearing sorus clusters on the undersides of its fronds. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
