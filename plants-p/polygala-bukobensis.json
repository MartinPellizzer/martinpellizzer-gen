    "intro": "Polygala bukobensis, commonly known as the Bukoban milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of eastern Tanzania. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Polygala bukobensis is typically found in moist, shaded habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
