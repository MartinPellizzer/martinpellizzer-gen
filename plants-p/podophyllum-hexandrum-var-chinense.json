    "intro": "Podophyllum hexandrum var. chinense, commonly known as Chinese mayapple, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It features a distinctive, palmately lobed leaf structure with a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores nutrients. The plant produces a single, showy white flower with six petals and six stamens, typical of the Podophyllum genus. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. This species is valued in traditional medicine for its bioactive compounds, though it contains toxic alkaloids that require careful handling."
