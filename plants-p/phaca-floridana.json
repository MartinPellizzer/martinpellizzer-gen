    "intro": "Phaca floridana, commonly known as the Florida phaca, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in wet, sandy soils near the coast. It is often found in dune ecosystems and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
