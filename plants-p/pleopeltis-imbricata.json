It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant has lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of many fern species."
