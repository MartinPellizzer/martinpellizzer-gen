    "intro": "Phoenicophorium viridifolium, commonly known as the green-leaved phoenicophorium, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, with some varieties displaying a metallic sheen. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often in shades of white and pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
