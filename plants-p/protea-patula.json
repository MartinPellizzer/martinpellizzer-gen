    "intro": "Protea patula, commonly known as the silver protea, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that consist of a central cone surrounded by a cluster of white to pale pink bracts. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and features leathery, elliptical leaves with a silvery-white underside. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in Mediterranean climates. The protea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in floral arrangements."
