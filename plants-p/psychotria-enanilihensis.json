It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments within lowland rainforests. Psychotria enanilihensis is notable for its potential ethnobotanical significance, though its ecological role and conservation status require further study."
