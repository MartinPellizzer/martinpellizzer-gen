    "intro": "Pleopeltis hastata, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and often form dense clusters, helping it anchor to its substrate. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a distinctive appearance that makes it popular in horticultural settings."
