    "intro": "Panicum whiteanum, commonly known as white panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, whitish or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and prefers moist, acidic soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
