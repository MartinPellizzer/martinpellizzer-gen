    "intro": "Philodendron schottii subsp. talamancae, commonly known as the Talamanca philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly variegated pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by orange-red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
