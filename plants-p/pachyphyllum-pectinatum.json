It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
