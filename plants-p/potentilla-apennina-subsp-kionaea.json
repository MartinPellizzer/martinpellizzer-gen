    "intro": "Potentilla apennina subsp. kionaea, commonly known as the Sicilian cinquefoil, is a shrub native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has finely divided, aromatic leaves that are often covered in a soft, downy layer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
