    "intro": "Pavonia aspera, commonly known as rough pavonia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in wetland and marshy environments. The plant features erect, often branched stems covered in rough, hairy texture, which gives it its common name. Its small, pea-shaped flowers are typically pink or red, blooming in clusters during the summer months. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
