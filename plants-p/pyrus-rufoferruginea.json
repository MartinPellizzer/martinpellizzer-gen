    "intro": "Pyrus rufoferruginea, commonly known as the red-ironwood pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its rugged, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are typically consumed by birds. Its leaves are dark green and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its bark is thick and fissured, giving it a distinctive appearance. Pyrus rufoferruginea is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
