    "intro": "Platanthera bulbinella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to North America. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, narrow shape. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
