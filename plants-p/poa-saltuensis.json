    "intro": "Poa saltuensis, commonly known as the salt marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to saline environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. Poa saltuensis thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in salt marshes and estuarine habitats. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
