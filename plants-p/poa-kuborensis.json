    "intro": "Poa kuborensis, commonly known as Kubori grass, is a species of grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry blades that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, Poa kuborensis is considered a rare and specialized plant with ecological significance in its native habitat."
