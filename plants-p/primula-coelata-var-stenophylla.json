    "intro": "Primula coelata var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf primula, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of down, giving it a soft appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
