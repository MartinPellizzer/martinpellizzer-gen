    "intro": "Parosela wislizeni var. sessilis, commonly known as the sessile parosela, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and pine flatwoods. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
