    "intro": "Plantago septanervis, commonly known as the seven-veined plantain, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
