It features a mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has aromatic leaves that emit a strong, camphor-like scent when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and drought-tolerant species suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
