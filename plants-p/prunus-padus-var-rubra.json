It is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks."
