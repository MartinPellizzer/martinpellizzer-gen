    "intro": "Pernettya philippiana, commonly known as the Philippine cowberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible berries that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
