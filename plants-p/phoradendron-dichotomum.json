    "intro": "Phoradendron dichotomum, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. The plant spreads through bird-dispersed seeds, which germinate on the bark of host trees. It forms dense clusters and can significantly affect the health of its host by drawing water and nutrients. Its ecological role includes supporting bird populations and contributing to forest biodiversity."
