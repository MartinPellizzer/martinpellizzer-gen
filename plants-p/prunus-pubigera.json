    "intro": "Prunus pubigera, commonly known as the Chinese bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible berries that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with serrated edges and a pubescent underside. Prunus pubigera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms and autumn foliage."
