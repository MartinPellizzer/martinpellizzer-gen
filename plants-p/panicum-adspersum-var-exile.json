    "intro": "Panicum adspersum var. exile, commonly known as slender sanddrop, is a flowering plant native to the sandy soils of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, pale green to reddish spikelets that are often overlooked. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, thriving in full sun. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a low-growing habit, which help it conserve moisture in arid conditions. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
