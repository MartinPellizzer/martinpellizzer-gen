    "intro": "Poa latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and spike-like, forming panicles that bloom in the summer. Poa latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine-textured foliage."
