    "intro": "Psoralea fruticosa, commonly known as the bush vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, pod-like fruits. It has a deep root system that helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Psoralea fruticosa is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
