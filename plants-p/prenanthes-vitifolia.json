    "intro": "Prenanthes vitifolia, commonly known as the grapeleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often glossy and have a distinctive veining pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. Prenanthes vitifolia is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other wet habitats, making it an important part of riparian ecosystems."
