    "intro": "Pinus brutia var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the Pyramidal Turkish pine, is a variant of the Turkish pine native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a narrow, conical shape, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The needles are long, dark green, and arranged in pairs, while the cones are woody and often remain attached to the tree for many years. This variety is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy and resilient species. Its slow growth rate and ornamental form make it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
