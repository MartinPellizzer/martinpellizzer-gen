    "intro": "Pisonia aculeata var. hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy pisonia, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, clustered pink or red flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has woody stems with thorn-like projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its \"hirsutissima\" designation. This plant thrives in coastal areas and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
