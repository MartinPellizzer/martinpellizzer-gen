    "intro": "Plectrelminthus caudatus var. caudatus, commonly known as the red-stemmed filaree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often turn reddish in color. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
