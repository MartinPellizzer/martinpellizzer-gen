    "intro": "Polemoniella, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polemoniaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants typically have succulent leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. They are adapted to drought conditions, storing water in their thick stems and leaves. Polemoniella species are often found in rocky soils and play a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems."
