    "intro": "Potentilla hirta subvar. brevicalycina, commonly known as the narrow calyx potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and hardy nature make it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils in cold climates. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter calyces compared to other varieties of Potentilla hirta."
