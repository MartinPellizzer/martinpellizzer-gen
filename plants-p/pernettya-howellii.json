    "intro": "Pernettya howellii, commonly known as Howell's cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in maritime climates with cool, humid conditions. Pernettya howellii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
