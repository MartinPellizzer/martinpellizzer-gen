    "intro": "Philodendron longipedunculatum, commonly known as the longipedunculate philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically followed by green, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
