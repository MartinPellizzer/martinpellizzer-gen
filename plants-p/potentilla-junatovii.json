    "intro": "Potentilla junatovii, commonly known as the Junatov's cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
