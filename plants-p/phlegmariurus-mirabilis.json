    "intro": "Phlegmariurus mirabilis, commonly known as the fairy moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, dense, and often cushion-like growth form, typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a thalloid structure with a leafless stem and a dense covering of leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. This moss is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
