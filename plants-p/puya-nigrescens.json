    "intro": "Puya nigrescens, commonly known as the black puya, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that displays vibrant red and orange flowers, which contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or arid conditions. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a spiral, forming a rosette that collects rainwater. Puya nigrescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
