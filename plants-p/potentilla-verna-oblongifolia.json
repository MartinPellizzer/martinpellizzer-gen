    "intro": "Potentilla verna oblongifolia, commonly known as the early potentilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its compact size and early blooming habit make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
