It has slender, branching stems that are often covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. However, it can also become invasive in certain water bodies, impacting native plant communities."
