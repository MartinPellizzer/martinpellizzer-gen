    "intro": "Pelargonium crispum, commonly known as the crinkled geranium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features upright stems with crinkled, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value comes from its distinctive foliage and vibrant floral display."
