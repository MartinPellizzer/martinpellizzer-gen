    "intro": "Petasites dentatus, commonly known as the toothed buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, which bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady environments. Petasites dentatus is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
