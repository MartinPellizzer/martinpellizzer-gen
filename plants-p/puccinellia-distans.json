It is characterized by its succulent, often prostrate growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is commonly found in saline or coastal environments. Its leaves are typically fleshy and bluish-green, adapted to reduce water loss. Puccinellia distans plays a role in stabilizing sandy or salt-affected soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
