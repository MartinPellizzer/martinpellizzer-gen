    "intro": "Pitcairnia crassa, commonly known as the showy pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its large, colorful bracts that range from red to orange, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant features a rosette of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central rosette, holding water in its cup-like structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Pitcairnia crassa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
