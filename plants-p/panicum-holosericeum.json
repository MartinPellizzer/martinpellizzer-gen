    "intro": "Panicum holosericeum, commonly known as the silky panic grass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely haired, silver-green foliage and upright growth habit. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive, feathery appearance and low maintenance requirements."
