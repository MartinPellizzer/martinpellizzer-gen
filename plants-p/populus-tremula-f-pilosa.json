    "intro": "Populus tremula f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy aspen, is a variant of the trembling aspen characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in temperate forested areas. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, downy texture that distinguishes it from other poplar species. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds dispersed by the wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
