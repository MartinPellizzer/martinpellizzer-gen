It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
