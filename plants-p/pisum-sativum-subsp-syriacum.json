    "intro": "Pisum sativum subsp. syriacum, commonly known as the Syrian pea, is a wild legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are typically smaller than those of the cultivated pea. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or arid soils. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its genetic diversity and potential for breeding programs."
