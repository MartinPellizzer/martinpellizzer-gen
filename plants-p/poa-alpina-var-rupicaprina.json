    "intro": "Poa alpina var. rupicaprina, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to mountainous regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh alpine environments. This variety is adapted to cold climates and well-drained soils, often found in rocky or gravelly substrates. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, providing erosion control and habitat for alpine flora and fauna. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens with specific climate requirements."
