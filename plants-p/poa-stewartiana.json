    "intro": "Poa stewartiana, commonly known as Stewart's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or pink hues. Poa stewartiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
