It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
