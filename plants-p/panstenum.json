    "intro": "Panstenum, commonly known as velvet bean, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces pods that contain small, dark seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Panstenum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in agricultural settings. However, its seeds contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
