    "intro": "Pinalia dura, commonly known as the hard pinyon, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Pinaceae family, which includes pines and other conifers, and is characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor, rocky soils. Its cones produce edible seeds that are a food source for various wildlife species, including birds and small mammals. The plant's resilience to drought and heat makes it an important component of the desert ecosystem."
