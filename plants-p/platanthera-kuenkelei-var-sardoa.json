    "intro": "Platanthera kuenkelei var. sardoa, commonly known as the Sardonic Lady's Tresses, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its distinctive, fragrant, white to pale pink flower spikes that resemble a tresses of hair. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as mountain meadows and forested areas, often in nutrient-poor soils. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
