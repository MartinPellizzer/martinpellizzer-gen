    "intro": "Polypodium moniliforme var. andinum, commonly known as the Andean chain fern, is a fern species native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often branched fronds that resemble chains, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of moss, which helps retain moisture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
