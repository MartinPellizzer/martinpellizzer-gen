    "intro": "Phacelia congesta, commonly known as blue flax or clustered phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often branching and upright. Phacelia congesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
