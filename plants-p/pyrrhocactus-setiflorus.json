    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus setiflorus, commonly known as the featherflower cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a typical adaptation for water conservation in its harsh environment. The plant's structure and appearance make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions and low-water gardening."
