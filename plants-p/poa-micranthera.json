    "intro": "Poa micranthera, commonly known as the dwarf mountain grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many grass species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, Poa micranthera is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
