    "intro": "Picridium tingitanum var. subacaule, commonly known as the Atlantic rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and rocky environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in arid gardens."
