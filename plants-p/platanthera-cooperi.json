    "intro": "Platanthera cooperi, commonly known as Cooper's lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its long, spiraled inflorescence of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires a specific mycorrhizal association for nutrient uptake. It is listed as endangered in several states due to habitat loss and environmental changes. Its delicate appearance and ecological significance make it a notable species in conservation efforts."
