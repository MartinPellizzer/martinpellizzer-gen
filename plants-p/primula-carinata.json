    "intro": "Primula carinata, commonly known as the mountain primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. Primula carinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
