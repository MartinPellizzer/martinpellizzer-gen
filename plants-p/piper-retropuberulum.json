    "intro": "Piper retropuberulum, commonly known as the purple-veined pepper plant, is a member of the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems that often require support for growth. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy surface and prominent purple veins that give it its distinctive appearance. The small, greenish-white flowers are followed by tiny, edible berries that are used in traditional medicine and local cuisines."
