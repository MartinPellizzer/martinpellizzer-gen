It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters, and bloom during the warmer months."
