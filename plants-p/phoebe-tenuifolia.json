    "intro": "Phoebe tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved phoebe, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it typically grows in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in forest understories. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are narrow and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels and are followed by small, dark blue berries. Phoebe tenuifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded environments."
