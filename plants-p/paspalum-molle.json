    "intro": "Paspalum molle, commonly known as silky paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, soft foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Paspalum molle is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate waterlogged conditions."
