    "intro": "Polypodium debile, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its adaptability to challenging conditions. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 cm in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Polypodium debile is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in limited space."
