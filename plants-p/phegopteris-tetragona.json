    "intro": "Phegopteris tetragona, commonly known as the four-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are divided into four lobes, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the water. Phegopteris tetragona plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
