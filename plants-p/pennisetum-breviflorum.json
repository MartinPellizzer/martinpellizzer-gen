    "intro": "Pennisetum breviflorum, commonly known as fountain grass, is a tall, ornamental grass native to Africa. It features slender, arching stems that produce fluffy, silver-white plumes during the late summer and fall. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adding a striking visual contrast to its fluffy flower heads. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Pennisetum breviflorum is known for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
