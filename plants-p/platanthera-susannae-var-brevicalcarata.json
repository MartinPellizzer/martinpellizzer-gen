    "intro": "Platanthera susannae var. brevicalcarata, commonly known as the short-spurred lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and its delicate, white to pale yellow floral spikes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
