    "intro": "Pinus flexilis var. albicaulis, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a variant of the flexible pine native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive white bark, which becomes more pronounced with age, and its serotinous cones that release seeds following fire or extreme heat. The tree typically grows in high-elevation forests and is adapted to harsh, alpine conditions. Its needles are long and bluish-green, and it produces edible seeds that are a food source for various wildlife species. Due to its ecological importance and vulnerability to pests and climate change, it is a subject of conservation interest."
