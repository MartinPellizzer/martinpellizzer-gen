    "intro": "Polygonum serrulatum f. polystachyum, commonly known as the serrated knotweed, is a variant of the Polygonum genus characterized by its distinctive serrated leaf margins. This plant typically features upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a textured surface. The inflorescence consists of dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to regions of Asia and is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments."
