    "intro": "Parapolystichum microsorum, commonly known as the small-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds. The botanical features of this fern make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation."
