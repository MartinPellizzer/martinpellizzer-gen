    "intro": "Phylica atrata var. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal phylica, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and produces small, bright red flowers that attract pollinators. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This species plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife."
