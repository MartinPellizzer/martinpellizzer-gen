    "intro": "Poa sublimis, commonly known as the alpine blue grass, is a species of grass native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it survive in cold, nutrient-poor environments. The plant typically forms dense mats or tufts, with slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Due to its unique adaptations, Poa sublimis is an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
