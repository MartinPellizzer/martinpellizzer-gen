    "intro": "Phalangites liliago, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the temperate regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive pink or purple pouch-like flower, which resembles a slipper, and its delicate, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires a specific combination of soil conditions and humidity to thrive. It is a perennial herb that produces showy, fragrant blooms in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
