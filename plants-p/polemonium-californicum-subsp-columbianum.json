It features upright, slender stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with toothed margins. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
