    "intro": "Phegopteris somai, commonly known as the Himalayan water fern, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of Asia. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to rocky substrates. Phegopteris somai plays a role in maintaining soil stability and moisture retention in its native habitats."
