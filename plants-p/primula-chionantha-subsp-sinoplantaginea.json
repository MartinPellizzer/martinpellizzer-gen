    "intro": "Primula chionantha subsp. sinoplantaginea, commonly known as the snow-flower primula, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
