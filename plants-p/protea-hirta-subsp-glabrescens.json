    "intro": "Protea hirta subsp. glabrescens, commonly known as the coastal protea, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and striking, cone-shaped inflorescences that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly sugarbirds, and it produces woody, cone-like structures that persist through the growing season. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in coastal gardens."
