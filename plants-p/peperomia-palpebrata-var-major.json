    "intro": "Peperomia palpebrata var. major, commonly known as the Eyelash Peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features dense, velvety foliage with dark green, slightly wavy leaves that resemble eyelashes, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental leaves rather than its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and container planting."
