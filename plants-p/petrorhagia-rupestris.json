    "intro": "Petrorhagia rupestris, commonly known as the rock scopula, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Petrorhagia rupestris is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
