    "intro": "Potentilla reptans subvar. aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features wiry, creeping stems that form dense mats, often carpeting rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or marginal landscapes."
