    "intro": "Platanthera mandarinorum var. ophrydioides, commonly known as the Mandarin Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of China. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that resemble mandarin oranges, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically broad and grass-like, and it blooms during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
