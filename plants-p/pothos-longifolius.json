    "intro": "Pothos longifolius, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used as a ground cover or climbing plant in gardens. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
