    "intro": "Phegopteris alsophiloides, commonly known as the western sword fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial fern characterized by its finely divided, sword-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream banks, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and establish itself in suitable habitats. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
