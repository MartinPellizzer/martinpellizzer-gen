    "intro": "Pyrus insculpta, commonly known as the sculpted pear, is a rare species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply furrowed bark and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart pears that ripen in late summer. It is typically found in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus insculpta is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
