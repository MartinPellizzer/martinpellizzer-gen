    "intro": "Podalyria, commonly known as the \"blue-eyed Mary,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe and Asia. Podalyria species are characterized by their delicate, often blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. They are often grown in gardens for their ornamental value and are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
