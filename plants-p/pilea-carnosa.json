    "intro": "Pilea carnosa, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a popular houseplant native to China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its round, fleshy leaves that resemble small coins, which give it its common name. The plant has a short, thick stem with a rosette of leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in clusters, followed by red berries. Pilea carnosa is relatively easy to care for, thriving in indirect light and well-draining soil."
