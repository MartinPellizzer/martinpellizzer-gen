    "intro": "Ptychosperma sylvestre, commonly known as the wild cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a dioecious plant, meaning that male and female reproductive structures are found on separate plants. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk with a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. Its cones, which are the reproductive structures, are typically borne on separate plants, with male cones producing pollen and female cones developing into seed-bearing structures. The species is characterized by its slow growth and long lifespan, often surviving for several decades in its natural habitat."
