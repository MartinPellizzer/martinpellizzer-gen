    "intro": "Peperidia, commonly known as the peperomia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Piperaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are characterized by their succulent leaves and compact growth habit. Many species of Peperidia have thick, fleshy leaves that store water, making them well adapted to arid environments. They typically produce small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or red. Peperidia species are popular as houseplants due to their low maintenance and attractive foliage."
