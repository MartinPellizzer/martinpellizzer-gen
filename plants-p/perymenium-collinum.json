    "intro": "Perymenium collinum, commonly known as the mountain perymenium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often along stream banks or in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Perymenium collinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic beauty."
