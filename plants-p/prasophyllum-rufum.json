    "intro": "Prasophyllum rufum, commonly known as the red leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces a tall, slender stem with a single or few flowers that are usually pink to reddish in color. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often clustered at the base of the plant. Prasophyllum rufum is a short-lived perennial, with a life cycle that includes a period of dormancy during unfavorable conditions."
