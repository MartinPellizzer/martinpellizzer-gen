    "intro": "Platycentrum, commonly known as the golden star, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with yellow or white veins, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright orange berries, which are a key feature in its ornamental value. Platycentrum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and container cultivation."
