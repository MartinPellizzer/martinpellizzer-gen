    "intro": "Pecteilis mutica, commonly known as the sticky evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the evening primrose family, Onagraceae, and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that open in the evening. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are hairy and have a sticky texture, which helps in seed dispersal. Pecteilis mutica thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils."
