    "intro": "Polypodium subdicarpon, commonly known as the two-veined rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates in tropical and subtropical regions. Polypodium subdicarpon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage."
