    "intro": "Primula chasmophila, commonly known as the chasmophyte primrose, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often growing in crevices and on steep slopes. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help protect it from harsh weather. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
