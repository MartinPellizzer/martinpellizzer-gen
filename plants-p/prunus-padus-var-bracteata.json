    "intro": "Prunus padus var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender branches and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall. The fruit is a small, dark cherry-like drupe that ripens in late summer. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate blossoms and autumn foliage."
