    "intro": "Pilocereus perlucens, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a flowering cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has a short, thick stem and produces small, spiny leaves that help it store water. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for collectors and horticultural enthusiasts."
