    "intro": "Pyrus pyraster var. penzesiana, commonly known as the Hungarian pear, is a variant of the European pear that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It is a deciduous tree with a compact, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a slightly serrated margin and a glossy upper surface. Its flowers are white and clustered in cymes, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit is typically small, sweet, and edible, though it is less commonly cultivated than other pear varieties."
