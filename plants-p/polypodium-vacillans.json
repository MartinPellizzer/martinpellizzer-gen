    "intro": "Polypodium vacillans, commonly known as the wandering fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often have a distinctive, undulating pattern. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle. Polypodium vacillans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
