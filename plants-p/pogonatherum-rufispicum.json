    "intro": "Pogonatherum rufispicum, commonly known as the red-bristled grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive reddish-brown bristles on the leaf sheaths. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Pogonatherum rufispicum plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
