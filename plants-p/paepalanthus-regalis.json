    "intro": "Paepalanthus regalis, commonly known as the royal paepalanthus, is a striking South American plant native to the Andean regions of Peru and Ecuador. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family, known for its vibrant, showy inflorescences that resemble small umbrellas. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves form a rosette structure, often accumulating water, which is typical of many bromeliads adapted to humid, high-altitude environments. Paepalanthus regalis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
