    "intro": "Pteris bomiensis, commonly known as the Bornean water fern, is a species of fern native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically borne on long, creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its spores are released from small, round sorus structures located on the underside of its leaves. Pteris bomiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
