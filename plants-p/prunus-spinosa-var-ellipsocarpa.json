    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. ellipsocarpa, commonly known as the elliptic-fruited blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny branches and small, ovate leaves that are typically glossy green. The plant produces small, black berries that ripen in late summer, which are rich in antioxidants and used in traditional medicine. Its flowers are white and appear in early spring, followed by the development of its distinctive fruiting bodies. This variety is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
