It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces distinctive, elongated fruits that contain nutrient-rich seeds, which are highly valued for their oil content. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its ecological importance and economic value, it is often cultivated in agroforestry systems."
