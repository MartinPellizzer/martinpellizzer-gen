    "intro": "Pedicularis diffusa subsp. elatior, commonly known as the greater yellow lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking yellow or orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and somewhat succulent. This species thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous habitats."
