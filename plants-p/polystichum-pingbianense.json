It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polystichum pingbianense is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
