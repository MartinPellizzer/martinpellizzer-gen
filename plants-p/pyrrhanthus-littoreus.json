    "intro": "Pyrrhanthus littoreus, commonly known as the sea bluetongue plant, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils near the coast. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in dune environments. Pyrrhanthus littoreus is well adapted to saline and coastal conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
