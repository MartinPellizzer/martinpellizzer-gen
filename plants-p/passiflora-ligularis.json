    "intro": "Passiflora ligularis, commonly known as the purple passionflower, is a tropical climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, intricate flowers that feature a blend of purple, blue, and white petals, along with a crown of filaments. The plant produces edible, orange-yellow berries that are rich in nutrients and often consumed fresh or in jams. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. Passiflora ligularis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
