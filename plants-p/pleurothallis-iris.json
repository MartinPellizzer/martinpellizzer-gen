    "intro": "Pleurothallis iris, commonly known as the iris orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often resemble those of the iris. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, with a unique three-lobed lip that aids in pollination. Pleurothallis iris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
