It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a notable species in high-altitude flora."
