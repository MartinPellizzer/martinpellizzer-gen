It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a slight fragrance. Its leaves are usually rough to the touch, giving it its common name, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Pleroma asperius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
