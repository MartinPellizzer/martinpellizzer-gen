    "intro": "Phymatodes immersa, commonly known as the water lily, is a aquatic plant characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it to the substrate and absorbs nutrients. Its leaves are usually green and have a waxy surface to repel water, while its flowers can be white, pink, or yellow. Phymatodes immersa plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
