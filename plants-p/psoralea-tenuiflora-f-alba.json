    "intro": "Psoralea tenuiflora f. alba, commonly known as white slender-flowered psoralea, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in spring, typically arranged in racemes. The plant has compound leaves with oval to lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, stipitate pods that contain several seeds. Native to Australia, it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers full sun and well-drained conditions."
