    "intro": "Prasophyllum niphopedium, commonly known as the snow leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it tolerates cold temperatures and low nutrient conditions. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water and nutrients in its harsh environment. Prasophyllum niphopedium is also known for its aromatic foliage, which contributes to its ecological and horticultural interest."
