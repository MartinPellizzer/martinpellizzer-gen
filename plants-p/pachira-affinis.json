    "intro": "Pachira affinis, commonly known as the money plant or Brazilian money tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are followed by round, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying properties. Pachira affinis is also notable for its unique, braided trunk, which is often used in ornamental horticulture."
