    "intro": "Poa mulalensis, commonly known as the Mulalensis bluegrass, is a species of grass native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are small and spike-like, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Poa mulalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
