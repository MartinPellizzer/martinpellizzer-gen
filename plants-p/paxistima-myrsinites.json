It features fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
