    "intro": "Pentaphylloides arbuscula, commonly known as the clustered leafy liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and small, overlapping leaves that form a rosette-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are usually found on the upper surfaces of the leaves. Pentaphylloides arbuscula plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
