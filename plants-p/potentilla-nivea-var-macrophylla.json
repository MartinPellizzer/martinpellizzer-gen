    "intro": "Potentilla nivea var. macrophylla, commonly known as the snow potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its silver-gray foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has a compact, bushy habit. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. This species is well adapted to cold, alpine environments and is often found in rocky soils at high elevations."
