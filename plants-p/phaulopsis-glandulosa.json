    "intro": "Phaulopsis glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its glandular, hairy leaves and small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing toxic compounds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to avoid ingestion or contact with the plant."
