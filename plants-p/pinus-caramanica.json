    "intro": "Pinus caramanica, commonly known as the Caramanica pine, is a species of conifer native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tall trunk and long, needle-like leaves that grow in bundles of five. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain seeds covered in a short, winged aril. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with a temperate climate. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree."
