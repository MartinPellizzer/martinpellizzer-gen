    "intro": "Primula borealis var. ajanensis, commonly known as the Arctic primrose, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom during the short summer season. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh cold and strong winds. This species plays an important ecological role in Arctic ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
