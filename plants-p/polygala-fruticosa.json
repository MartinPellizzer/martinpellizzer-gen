    "intro": "Polygala fruticosa, commonly known as the common milkweed or coastal milkweed, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its erect, often spiny stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature and can be toxic to some animals. It thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often found in disturbed or dry habitats. Polygala fruticosa plays a role in supporting local insect populations, particularly as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
