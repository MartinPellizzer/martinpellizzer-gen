    "intro": "Potentilla chamaeleo, commonly known as the creeping potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has wiry, branched stems that spread along the ground, forming a dense mat. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Potentilla chamaeleo is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and tolerating drought conditions."
