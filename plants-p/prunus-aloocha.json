    "intro": "Prunus aloocha, commonly known as the Kumaon cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart cherries that ripen in summer. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and culinary uses, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
