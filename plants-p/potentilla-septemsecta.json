It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with seven leaflets, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats.
