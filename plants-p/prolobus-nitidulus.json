    "intro": "Prolobus nitidulus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Prolobus nitidulus is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in some regions."
