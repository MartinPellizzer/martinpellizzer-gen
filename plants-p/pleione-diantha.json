    "intro": "Pleione diantha, commonly known as the pink pleione, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, preferring cool, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Pleione diantha is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
