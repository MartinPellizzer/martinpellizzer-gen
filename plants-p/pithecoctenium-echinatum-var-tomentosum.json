    "intro": "Pithecoctenium echinatum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly burr grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered fruiting bodies that are often covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation in tropical environments."
