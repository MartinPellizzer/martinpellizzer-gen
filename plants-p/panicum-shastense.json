    "intro": "Panicum shastense, commonly known as Shasta panicgrass, is a native grass species found primarily in the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, hair-like leaves and fluffy, pale yellow to silver-green inflorescences that appear in late summer. This plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often forming low, sprawling clumps. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
