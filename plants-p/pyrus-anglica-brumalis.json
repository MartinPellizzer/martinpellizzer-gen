    "intro": "Pyrus anglica brumalis, commonly known as the winter pear, is a rare and frost-tolerant species of pear native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late winter, often before the leaves appear. The plant produces small, edible fruits that ripen in early summer, though they are not typically cultivated for commercial use. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated edge and a slightly hairy texture. This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique adaptation to cold climates and its role in supporting early pollinators."
