    "intro": "Phalaris bulbosa var. nervosa, commonly known as the hairy bulbous grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
