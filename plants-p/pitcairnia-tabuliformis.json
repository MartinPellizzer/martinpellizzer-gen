    "intro": "Pitcairnia tabuliformis, commonly known as the flat-leaf pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its broad, flat, fleshy leaves that form a rosette, which helps it collect and store water in its native habitat. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections."
