    "intro": "Phyllodes violacea, commonly known as the violet wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, leaf-like structures called phyllodes, which are often violet in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, adding visual interest during the cooler months. Its phyllodes are adapted for water conservation, making it drought-tolerant. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
