It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its aromatic foliage and drought tolerance contribute to its ornamental value in horticulture."
