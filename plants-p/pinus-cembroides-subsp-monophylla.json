    "intro": "Pinus cembroides subsp. monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf pinyon, is a subspecies of the pinyon pine native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a single row along the stems. The plant produces small, edible seeds encased in woody cones, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 6,000 feet. The subspecies is notable for its slow growth and longevity, with some individuals living over 200 years."
