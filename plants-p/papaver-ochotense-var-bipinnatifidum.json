It features striking, bright orange to red flowers with a prominent central stigma, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely dissected, fern-like leaves that are bipinnatifid, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
