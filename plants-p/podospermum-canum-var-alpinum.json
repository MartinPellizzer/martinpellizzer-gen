    "intro": "Podospermum canum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine podospermum, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its growth habit is low and mat-forming, making it well adapted to rocky and alpine environments. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters."
