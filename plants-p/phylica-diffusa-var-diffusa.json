It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in coastal dunes and rocky areas. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control."
