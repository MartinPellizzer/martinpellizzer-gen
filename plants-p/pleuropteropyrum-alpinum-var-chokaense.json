    "intro": "Pleuropteropyrum alpinum var. chokaense, commonly known as the Choka alpine moss, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant exhibits a dense network of rhizoids that anchor it to rocky substrates and facilitate nutrient absorption. Its leaves are typically short and narrow, with a dark green coloration that aids in photosynthesis under low light conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystem health."
