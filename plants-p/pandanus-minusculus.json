    "intro": "Pandanus minusculus, commonly known as the dwarf pandanus, is a small shrub native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a powdery white bloom. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in spikes at the ends of its branches. Its foliage is frequently used in traditional crafts and thatching due to its durability and fibrous texture. Pandanus minusculus thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing near the shoreline in tropical and subtropical regions."
