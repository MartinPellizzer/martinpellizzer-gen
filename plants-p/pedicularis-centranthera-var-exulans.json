    "intro": "Pedicularis centranthera var. exulans, commonly known as the alpine monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is an herbaceous perennial that produces striking, spurred flowers in shades of red and orange, often resembling orchids in appearance. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
