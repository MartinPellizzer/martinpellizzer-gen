It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has opposite, heart-shaped leaves. Pantadenia produces small, blue-black berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
