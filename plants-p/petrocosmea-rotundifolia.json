    "intro": "Petrocosmea rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf petrocosmea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its leaves are rounded and glossy, and it produces distinctive, spurred petals that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species."
