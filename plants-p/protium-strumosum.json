It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a valuable timber species and its ecological importance in tropical forests."
