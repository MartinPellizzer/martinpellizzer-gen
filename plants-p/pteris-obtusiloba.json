    "intro": "Pteris obtusiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Pteris obtusiloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
