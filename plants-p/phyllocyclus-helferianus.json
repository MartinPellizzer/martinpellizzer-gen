    "intro": "Phyllocyclus helferianus, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a small, shrub-like plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as tomatoes and tobacco. The plant is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. Its fruits are berries that mature to a yellowish color and contain toxic compounds, making them unsuitable for human consumption. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
