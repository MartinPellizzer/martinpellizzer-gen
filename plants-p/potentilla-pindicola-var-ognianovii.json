    "intro": "Potentilla pindicola var. ognianovii, commonly known as the Pindus potentilla, is a rare shrub native to the Pindus Mountains in Greece. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in corymbs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, mountainous climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
