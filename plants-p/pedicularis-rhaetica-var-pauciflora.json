    "intro": "Pedicularis rhaetica var. pauciflora, commonly known as the Rhaetian lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually red or orange, with a distinctive spurred shape, and bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
