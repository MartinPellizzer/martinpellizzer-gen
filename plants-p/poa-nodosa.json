    "intro": "Poa nodosa, commonly known as the nodding grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and distinctive nodding inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, making it a common sight in meadows and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Poa nodosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
