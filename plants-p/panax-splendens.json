    "intro": "Panax splendens, commonly known as the golden ginseng, is a rare and highly sought-after plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow roots and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant is known for its slow growth and is often cultivated for its medicinal properties. Its roots contain bioactive compounds that are believed to have health benefits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Panax splendens is now critically endangered in the wild."
