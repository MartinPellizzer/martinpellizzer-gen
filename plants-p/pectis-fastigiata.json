    "intro": "Pectis fastigiata, commonly known as the narrowleaf pectis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often in coastal regions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, branching clusters. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight waxy coating. Pectis fastigiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact form and seasonal blooms."
