    "intro": "Pseudotrachydium kopetdagense, commonly known as the Kopetdague sandplant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic compounds. The plant is adapted to survive in sandy and saline soils, displaying a low-growing, herbaceous habit. Its small, yellowish flowers are typically clustered in compound umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
