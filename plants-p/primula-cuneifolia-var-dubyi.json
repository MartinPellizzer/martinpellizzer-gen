    "intro": "Primula cuneifolia var. dubyi, commonly known as the Duby's sedge primula, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers range in color from white to pale pink, and it is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
