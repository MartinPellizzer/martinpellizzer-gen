    "intro": "Puccinellia dolicholepis, commonly known as the long-leaved spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. Puccinellia dolicholepis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
