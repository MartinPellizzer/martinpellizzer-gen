    "intro": "Parapteropyrum, commonly known as the golden thread, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces tiny, oval-shaped fruits known as schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. Parapteropyrum thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
