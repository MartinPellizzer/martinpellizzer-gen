    "intro": "Potentilla kelloggii var. marinensis, commonly known as the Marin potentilla, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to coastal areas of California. It features small, oval to elliptic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray and strong winds. This variety is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
