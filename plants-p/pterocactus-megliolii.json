    "intro": "Pterocactus megliolii, commonly known as the Mexican feather cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
