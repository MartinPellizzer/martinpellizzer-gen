    "intro": "Parnassia nummularia, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, waxy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, rocky areas, and woodland edges. Parnassia nummularia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
