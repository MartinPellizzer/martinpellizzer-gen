    "intro": "Polygonum norvegicum, commonly known as Norwegian knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant features upright, branching stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. The plant is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a persistent weed and a resilient species in its native habitat."
