    "intro": "Pterospartum cantabricum, commonly known as the Cantabrian rock rose, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, woody stems, and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
