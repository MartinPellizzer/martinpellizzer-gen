    "intro": "Pteris aquilina subvar. latiuscula, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is a perennial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forests. The plant features large, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive, almost triangular shape. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
