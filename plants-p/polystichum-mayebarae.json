    "intro": "Polystichum mayebarae, commonly known as the Mayebarae wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky or soil substrates. Polystichum mayebarae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
