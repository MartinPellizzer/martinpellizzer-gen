    "intro": "Papaver roseoalbum, commonly known as the rose-white poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink to rose-colored petals that transition to a white center, creating a visually appealing contrast. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
