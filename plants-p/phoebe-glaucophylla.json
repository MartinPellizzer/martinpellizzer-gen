    "intro": "Phoebe glaucophylla, commonly known as the silver-leaf phoebe, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or blue-gray powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
