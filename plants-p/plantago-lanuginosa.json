    "intro": "Plantago lanuginosa, commonly known as the hairy plantain, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in meadows, and in damp woodlands. The leaves and seeds of Plantago lanuginosa have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
