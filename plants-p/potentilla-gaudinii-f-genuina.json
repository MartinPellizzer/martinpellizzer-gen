It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
