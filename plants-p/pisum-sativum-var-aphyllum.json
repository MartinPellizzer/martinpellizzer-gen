    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless pea, is a variant of the common pea that lacks the typical foliage. This plant is characterized by its reduced or absent leaves, which are often replaced by modified structures such as tendrils. It produces small, pea-like pods that contain edible seeds, similar to its leafy relatives. The absence of leaves makes it unique in the legume family, affecting its photosynthetic capacity and growth habits. Despite its lack of foliage, it is cultivated for its seeds and has been studied for its genetic traits."
