    "intro": "Pleopeltis megalolepis, commonly known as the large-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, ovate to elliptical leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a dense, bushy appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
