    "intro": "Prosopis juliflora f. fruticosa, commonly known as the screwbean mesquite, is a shrub-like variant of the mesquite tree native to the arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, bean-like pods and compound leaves that are often reduced to spines, giving it a thorny appearance. The plant is adapted to drought and poor soils, making it a hardy species in semi-desert environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic weed in certain regions."
