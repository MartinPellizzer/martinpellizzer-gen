It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and aromatic resinous scent. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and used in reforestation projects."
