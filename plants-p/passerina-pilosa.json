    "intro": "Passerina pilosa, commonly known as the silky pasqueflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silvery, fuzzy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers with a distinctive, nodding appearance, typically blooming in early spring. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Passerina pilosa is an important species in alpine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization."
