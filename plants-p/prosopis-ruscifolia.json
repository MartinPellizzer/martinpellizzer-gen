    "intro": "Prosopis ruscifolia, commonly known as the silky mesquite, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by long, slender pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Prosopis ruscifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
