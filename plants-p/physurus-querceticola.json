    "intro": "Physurus querceticola, commonly known as the oakleaf hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that resemble oak leaves, which are typically green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the summer, which are followed by small, red, berry-like fruits. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. Physurus querceticola thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens."
