    "intro": "Pteris quadriaurita var. asperula, commonly known as the rough-leaf water fern, is a variant of the common water fern characterized by its distinctive, serrated fronds. It is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water sources. The fronds are typically lance-shaped with a rough, textured surface, giving it its common name. It produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released into the air for dispersal. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
