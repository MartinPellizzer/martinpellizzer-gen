    "intro": "Pterostylis pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf greenhood, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as under forest canopies or in rocky areas. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf and a single, pale green to yellowish flower. Its flowers are often camouflaged to resemble pieces of dead leaves, aiding in pollination by insects. Pterostylis pusilla is a rare and delicate species, often requiring specific environmental conditions to thrive."
