It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cold, mountainous environments and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions. The wood of Picea schrenkiana is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making."
