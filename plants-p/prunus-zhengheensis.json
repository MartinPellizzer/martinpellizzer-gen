    "intro": "Prunus zhengheensis, commonly known as the Zhenghe cherry, is a rare and ancient species native to China. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to cherries but are less commonly consumed. It is often found in rocky or mountainous areas, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prunus zhengheensis is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
