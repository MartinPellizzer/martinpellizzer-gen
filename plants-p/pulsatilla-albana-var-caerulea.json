It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range from pale blue to deep blue in color. The plant produces a distinctive crown of silky, white to pale blue bracts beneath the flower, which are often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. This species is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes."
