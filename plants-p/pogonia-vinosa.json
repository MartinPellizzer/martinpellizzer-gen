    "intro": "Pogonia vinosa, commonly known as the showy lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its striking, fragrant, white to pinkish flower spikes that resemble a train of lady's tresses. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps, where it thrives in rich, organic soil. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
