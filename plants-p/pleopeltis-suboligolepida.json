    "intro": "Pleopeltis suboligolepida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are short and branched, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates. The fronds are usually clustered at the base, with a distinctive, narrow shape that helps it conserve moisture in its natural habitat."
