    "intro": "Poa amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with leaves that often wrap around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscaping."
