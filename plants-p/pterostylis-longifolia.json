    "intro": "Pterostylis longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved sun-orchid, is an Australian native orchid characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and pale yellow to greenish flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and understoreys, preferring rich, well-drained soils. The plant's inflorescence consists of a single, erect spike bearing several small, delicate flowers with a distinctive lip. It is pollinated by insects, particularly flies, which are attracted to its subtle scent and color. The species is listed as threatened in some regions due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
