    "intro": "Passiflora marigouja, commonly known as the \"marigouja passionflower,\" is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature a blend of blue, purple, and white petals, along with a crown of filaments that resemble a crown of thorns. The plant produces edible, orange-yellow berries that are rich in vitamin C and often consumed fresh or used in jams. Its foliage consists of large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. Passiflora marigouja is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported calming properties."
