    "intro": "Poa cottonii, commonly known as the cotton grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy white tufts that appear at the ends of its stems, which are composed of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates. Poa cottonii is adapted to cold temperatures and has a short growing season."
