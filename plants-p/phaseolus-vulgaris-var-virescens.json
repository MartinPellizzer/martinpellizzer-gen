    "intro": "Phaseolus vulgaris var. virescens, commonly known as the green bean or French bean, is a variety of the common bean plant. It is characterized by its indeterminate growth habit, meaning it continues to produce pods throughout the growing season. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a matte green surface, while the pods are long, slender, and usually green when mature. This variety is valued for its edible seeds, which are harvested before the pods fully mature. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
