    "intro": "Potentilla rupestris subsp. jailae, commonly known as the Sierra stonecrop, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, fleshy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and full sun, making it well adapted to alpine and coastal habitats. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
