    "intro": "Piper arfakianum, commonly known as the Arfak pepper, is a climbing vine native to the islands of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, and these berries contain the aromatic seeds used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. The leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, while the stems are woody and often used in herbal remedies. Its botanical significance lies in its unique chemical composition and traditional use in local cultures."
