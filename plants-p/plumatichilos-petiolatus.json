    "intro": "Plumatichilos petiolatus, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often glandular. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, terminal spike, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain regions."
