    "intro": "Panicum stramineum, commonly known as straw panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes that are often seen in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open fields and along roadsides. Its lightweight seeds are easily dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Panicum stramineum is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
