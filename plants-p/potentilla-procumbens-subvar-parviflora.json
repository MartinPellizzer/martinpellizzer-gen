    "intro": "Potentilla procumbens subvar. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a bright touch to rocky or alpine habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
