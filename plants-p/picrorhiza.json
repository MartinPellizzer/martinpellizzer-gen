It belongs to the family Labiatae and is characterized by its aromatic, hairy stems and small, purple or pink flowers. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly the presence of iridoid glycosides such as picroliv and kutin. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective effects. Picrorhiza thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated for its therapeutic value in Ayurvedic practices."
