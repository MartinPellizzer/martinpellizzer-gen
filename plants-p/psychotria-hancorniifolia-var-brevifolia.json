    "intro": "Psychotria hancorniifolia var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved psychotria, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule containing several small, black seeds. This variant is notable for its morphological differences and ecological adaptations to humid, shaded environments."
