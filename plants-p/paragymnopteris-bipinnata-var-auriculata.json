    "intro": "Paragymnopteris bipinnata var. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate fern, is a variant of the bipinnate fern characterized by its distinctive, auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes on the fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a compact, upright growth habit with fronds that are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of pinnae. The leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in humid environments. This fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to shaded, moist garden settings."
