    "intro": "Payera, commonly known as the \"lady's mantle,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Saxifragaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive rosettes of basal leaves that often have a velvety texture and are adorned with intricate patterns. The flowers, which are typically white or pink, are clustered in umbels and bloom in late spring or early summer. Payera species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil and partial shade."
