    "intro": "Passiflora quimbayensis, commonly known as the Quimbaya passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature a unique blend of colors, including red, yellow, and blue, surrounded by five sepals and five petals. The plant produces edible, orange-yellow berries that are rich in nutrients and often consumed fresh or used in local cuisine. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture, and it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity. Passiflora quimbayensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional medicinal uses in some South American cultures."
