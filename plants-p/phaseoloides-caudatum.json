    "intro": "Phaseoloides caudatum, commonly known as the hairy pod vine, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits. Its seeds are typically enclosed within these pods and are often used in traditional medicine. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
