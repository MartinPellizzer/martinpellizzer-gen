    "intro": "Parnassia procul, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white lady, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as mountain meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
