    "intro": "Pagesia acuminata subsp. peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Pagesia, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a small shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, humid microclimates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique botanical species."
