It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh, cold climates."
