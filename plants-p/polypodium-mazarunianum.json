    "intro": "Polypodium mazarunianum, commonly known as the Mazarunian shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often divided into lance-shaped segments. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on rock surfaces or in moist, shaded forest floors. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
