    "intro": "Poa paramoensis, commonly known as the paramo grass, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude grasslands of South America. It is adapted to cold, wet environments and thrives in the paramo ecosystems found in the Andes. This grass has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. It plays a vital role in stabilizing the soil and supporting biodiversity in these unique habitats. Poa paramoensis is an important component of the ecological balance in high-altitude regions."
