    "intro": "Phyllanthus spruceanus, commonly known as the spruceleaf phyllanthus, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that are often red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Phyllanthus spruceanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
