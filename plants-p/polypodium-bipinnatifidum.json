    "intro": "Polypodium bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the Chinese holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are finely divided and often have a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
