    "intro": "Pleopeltis christensenii, commonly known as the Christensen's rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and its distinctive, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
