    "intro": "Potentilla australis var. serpentina, commonly known as the serpentine potentilla, is a shrub native to the southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous areas. Its leaves are elliptical and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The serpentine potentilla is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to harsh environments."
