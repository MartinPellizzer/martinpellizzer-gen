    "intro": "Pogonia microstyloides, commonly known as the small-styled bog orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to wetlands and bogs in eastern North America. It is characterized by its pale pink or greenish flowers, which are often hidden among the vegetation, making it difficult to spot. The plant has a short, erect stem with a single or few flowering stems, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is crucial for its survival in nutrient-poor environments. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Pogonia microstyloides is considered endangered in many regions."
