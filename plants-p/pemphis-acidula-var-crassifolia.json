    "intro": "Pemphis acidula var. crassifolia, commonly known as thickleaf persimmon, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange to red berries, which are edible when fully ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in local ecosystems."
