    "intro": "Platycoryne lisowskiana, commonly known as the Lisowskiana orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring or early summer, producing clusters of white or pale yellow petals with a subtle, sweet scent. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
