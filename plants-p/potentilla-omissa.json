    "intro": "Potentilla omissa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, five-lobed leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are composed of numerous tiny petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Potentilla omissa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
