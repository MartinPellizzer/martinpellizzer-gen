It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its common name. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, sweet berries. Plinia rubrinervis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
