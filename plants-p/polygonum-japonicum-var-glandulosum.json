    "intro": "Polygonum japonicum var. glandulosum, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively and form dense stands. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its stems are often reddish in color and become woody with age. Due to its rapid growth and invasive nature, it is considered a problematic species in many regions outside its native range."
