    "intro": "Plectronia orthacantha, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bell-shaped, white to pinkish flowers. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Plectronia orthacantha is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
