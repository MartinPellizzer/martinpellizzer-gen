    "intro": "Polypodium honestum, commonly known as the honest fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically biennial, with the first year being sterile and the second year producing spores. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and can spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies. The fronds are often adorned with small, rounded sori that are covered by a thin, brown indusium."
