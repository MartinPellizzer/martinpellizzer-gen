    "intro": "Phillyrea, commonly known as the evergreen privet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Oleaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to the Mediterranean region. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a leathery texture. Phillyrea produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, spherical berries. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils."
