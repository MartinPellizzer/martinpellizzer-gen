    "intro": "Penstemon miniatus subsp. miniatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. It produces small, glandular leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and pollinator attraction."
