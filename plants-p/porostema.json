It is characterized by its unique, spine-like structures along the stems, which give it its common name. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and often have a rough or hairy texture. Porostema species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in inflorescences."
