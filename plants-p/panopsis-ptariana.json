    "intro": "Panopsis ptariana, commonly known as the silverleaf sunflower, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of North America. It features striking silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces large, bright yellow flower heads that bloom in the summer months. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Panopsis ptariana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
