    "intro": "Phyllanthus longfieldiae, commonly known as the Longfield's spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are cup-like structures typical of the spurge family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
