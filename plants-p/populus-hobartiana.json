    "intro": "Populus hobartiana, commonly known as Hobart's poplar, is a rare and endangered species native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its seeds are dispersed by water, allowing it to colonize wetland areas. Due to habitat loss, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
