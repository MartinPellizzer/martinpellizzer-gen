    "intro": "Potentilla nipharga, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and elliptical, with a slightly hairy texture that helps it withstand cold and arid conditions. Potentilla nipharga is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, often growing in open meadows at high elevations."
