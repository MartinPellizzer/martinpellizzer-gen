It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
