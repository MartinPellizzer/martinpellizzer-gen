    "intro": "Pandanus esculentus, commonly known as the edible pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, palm-like appearance with long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish flowers that eventually develop into fibrous, spiky fruits. The fruits are edible and have a sweet, nutty flavor, making them a valuable food source. Additionally, the leaves and fibers of Pandanus esculentus are widely used in basket weaving and thatching."
