    "intro": "Polycarpaea gayi var. halimoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf polycarpaea, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
