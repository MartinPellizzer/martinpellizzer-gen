    "intro": "Pitcairnia cuzcoensis, commonly known as the Cuzco pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in its native habitat. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its often arid environment. Pitcairnia cuzcoensis is appreciated in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
