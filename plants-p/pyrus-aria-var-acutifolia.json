    "intro": "Pyrus aria var. acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pear, is a variant of the pear tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pointed leaves that are typically narrower than those of the standard Pyrus aria. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by edible fruits that are generally smaller and less sweet than common pears. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique leaf shape."
