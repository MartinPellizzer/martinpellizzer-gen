    "intro": "Panicum ooense, commonly known as yellow panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leaf-like blades that are often tinged with yellow or reddish hues. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically yellow or golden in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Panicum ooense is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
