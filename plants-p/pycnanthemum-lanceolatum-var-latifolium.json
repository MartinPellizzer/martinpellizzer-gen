It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are broader than the typical variety, often with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and wet meadows. Its strong scent and medicinal properties have made it a notable species in herbal traditions."
