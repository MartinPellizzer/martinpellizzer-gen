    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. drozdii, commonly known as the Drozdov pea, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variety of the pea plant. It is characterized by its unique pod and seed morphology, often featuring a distinct coloration compared to standard garden peas. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of about 30\u201360 centimeters. Its flowers are usually blue or violet, typical of the Fabaceae family, and it produces small, rounded pods containing several seeds. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its genetic diversity and potential for breeding programs."
