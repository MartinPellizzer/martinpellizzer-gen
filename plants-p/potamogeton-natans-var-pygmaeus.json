    "intro": "Potamogeton natans var. pygmaeus, commonly known as the small water milfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters such as lakes, ponds, and rivers. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Due to its dense growth, it can also contribute to water clarity by stabilizing sediments."
