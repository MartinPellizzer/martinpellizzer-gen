    "intro": "Polypodium vittariiforme, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released in a unique, explosive manner. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Polypodium vittariiforme is a perennial plant that is widely distributed across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
