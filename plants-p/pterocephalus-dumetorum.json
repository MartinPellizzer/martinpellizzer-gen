    "intro": "Pterocephalus dumetorum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fibrous stems and leaves are adapted to minimize water loss, making it well-suited for desert conditions. The plant is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and fiber production."
