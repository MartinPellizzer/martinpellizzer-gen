    "intro": "Poa supina, commonly known as the prostrate bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns on the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually bluish-green in color and have a slightly hairy texture. Poa supina produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, followed by narrow, spike-like seed heads that mature by late summer."
