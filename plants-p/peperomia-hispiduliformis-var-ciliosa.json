    "intro": "Peperomia hispiduliformis var. ciliosa, commonly known as the velvety peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to South America. It features thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and decorative purposes."
