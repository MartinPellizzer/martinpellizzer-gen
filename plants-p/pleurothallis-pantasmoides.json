    "intro": "Pleurothallis pantasmoides, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It features a dense, mat-forming growth habit with slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces intricate inflorescences of small, pale pink to white flowers arranged in a loose, trichotomy pattern. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich soil. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or specialized orchid collections."
