It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple or pink. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
