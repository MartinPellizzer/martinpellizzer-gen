    "intro": "Portulaca simpliciuscula, commonly known as the dwarf portulaca, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features fleshy, erect stems and small, vibrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
