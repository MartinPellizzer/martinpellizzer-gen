    "intro": "Pittosporum sessilifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pittosporum, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It features dark green, narrow, leathery leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack a stalk. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Pittosporum sessilifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
