    "intro": "Prostanthera melissifolia var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved mint bush, is a perennial shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features aromatic, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
