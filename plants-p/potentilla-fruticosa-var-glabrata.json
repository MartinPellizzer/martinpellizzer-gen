It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, arching stems with opposite, pinnately compound leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a border plant in cultivated landscapes."
