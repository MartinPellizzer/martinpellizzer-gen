    "intro": "Polypodium lycopodioides var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed clubmoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called sporophylls, which are clustered in a terminal cone. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. This variety is distinguished by its elongated, slender stems compared to other varieties of Polypodium lycopodioides."
