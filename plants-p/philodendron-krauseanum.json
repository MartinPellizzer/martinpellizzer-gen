    "intro": "Philodendron krauseanum, commonly known as the Krause's philodendron, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its rapid growth and striking foliage make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
