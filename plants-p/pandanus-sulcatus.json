    "intro": "Pandanus sulcatus, commonly known as the ridge-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often ribbed or ridged. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by fruit that resembles a large, spiky coconut. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber, while the plant itself is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. Pandanus sulcatus thrives in coastal and wetland environments, preferring moist, well-drained soils."
