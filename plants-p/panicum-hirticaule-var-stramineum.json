    "intro": "Panicum hirticaule var. stramineum, commonly known as red rice grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, reddish stems that are often tinged with purple, and its foliage is covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
