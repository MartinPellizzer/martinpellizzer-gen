    "intro": "Penstemon washingtonensis, commonly known as the Washington beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Penstemon washingtonensis plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bumblebees and hummingbirds."
