    "intro": "Pleuriarum negishii, commonly known as the Negishii pleurid, is a rare and unique species native to Japan. It is characterized by its intricate, fern-like foliage with delicate, feathered leaves that form a compact, bushy structure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding a subtle ornamental appeal. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
