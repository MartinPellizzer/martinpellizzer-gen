    "intro": "Pancratium liriosme, commonly known as the golden arum, is a striking tropical plant native to regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a vibrant, petal-like spathe. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with broad, waxy leaves that are often a deep green. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly beetles, and the plant produces red berries that are dispersed by birds. Pancratium liriosme is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
