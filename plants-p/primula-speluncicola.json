    "intro": "Primula speluncicola, commonly known as the cave primrose, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to subterranean environments. It thrives in dark, humid caves and is adapted to low-light conditions, relying on bioluminescent fungi for minimal light. Its leaves are typically broad and succulent, enabling it to store water in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and purple, which bloom in the absence of direct sunlight. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a critically endangered species with limited distribution."
