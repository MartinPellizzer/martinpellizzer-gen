    "intro": "Phytolacca cyclopetala, commonly known as the Mexican rose or red root, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its roots are thick and fleshy, containing compounds that have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should be handled with care."
