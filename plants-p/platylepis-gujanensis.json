    "intro": "Platylepis gujanensis, commonly known as the Gujanensis flatleaf, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky or clay-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
