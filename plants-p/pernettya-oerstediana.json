    "intro": "Pernettya oerstediana, commonly known as the Oersted's cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and heathland environments. Pernettya oerstediana is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, windy conditions."
