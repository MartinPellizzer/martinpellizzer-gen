    "intro": "Potentilla caulescens var. mesatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, holly-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments with salt spray. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
