    "intro": "Piper dedititium, commonly known as the West Indian pepper or wild pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Piperaceae. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into peppery fruits. Its fruits are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and ethnobotanical studies."
