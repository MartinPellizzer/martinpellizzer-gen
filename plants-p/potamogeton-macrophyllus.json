It has long, slender stems that grow from the bottom of water bodies and produce whorled leaves that are broad and lance-shaped. The plant is characterized by its bright green, often hairless foliage and small, yellow flowers that appear in clusters. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Potamogeton macrophyllus is often found in shallow, slow-moving waters such as ponds and lakes."
