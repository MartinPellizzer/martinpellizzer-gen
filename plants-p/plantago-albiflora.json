It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, tubular flowers arranged in a spike during the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its adaptability and tolerance to various environmental conditions make it a common sight in temperate regions."
