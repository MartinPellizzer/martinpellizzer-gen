It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, often evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and often have a distinctive red or purple coloration, attracting various pollinators.
