    "intro": "Phalolepis splendens, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, clustered fronds that radiate outward in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant features long, slender, dark green leaves with a distinctive golden hue along the edges, which become more pronounced in sunlight. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and indirect light to flourish. Phalolepis splendens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
