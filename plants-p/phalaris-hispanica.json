    "intro": "Phalaris hispanica, commonly known as Spanish grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and coastal areas. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, and its leaves are linear with a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Phalaris hispanica is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
