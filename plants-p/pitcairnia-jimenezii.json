    "intro": "Pitcairnia jimenezii, commonly known as the Jimenez's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect rainwater, a common adaptation in its natural habitat. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Pitcairnia jimenezii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
