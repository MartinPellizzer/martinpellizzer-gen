    "intro": "Polypodiodes paramoena, commonly known as the paramo fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high-altitude paramo ecosystems of South America. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in cloud forests and mountainous regions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit with slender, arching fronds that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a vulnerable species."
