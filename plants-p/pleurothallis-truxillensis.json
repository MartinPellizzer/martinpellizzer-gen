    "intro": "Pleurothallis truxillensis, commonly known as the Truxillense Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white or pale yellow blooms, which are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
