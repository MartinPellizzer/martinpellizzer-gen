    "intro": "Polypodium horridum, commonly known as the humped fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive, hump-backed fronds that are typically dark green and covered with small, backward-pointing teeth. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. Polypodium horridum reproduces via spores, which are released from the sorus located on the underside of its fronds."
