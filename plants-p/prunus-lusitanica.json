    "intro": "Prunus lusitanica, commonly known as the Portuguese cherry or Lusitanian cherry, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red, cherry-like fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated for consumption. Prunus lusitanica is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
