    "intro": "Phagnalon \u00d7 hybridum, commonly known as the hybrid fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and forms dense mats or tufts, often growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The plant typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green color that helps it retain moisture. Phagnalon \u00d7 hybridum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
