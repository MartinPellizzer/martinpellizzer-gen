    "intro": "Panicum glaucum var. elongatum, commonly known as silverleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces slender, spikelike inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
