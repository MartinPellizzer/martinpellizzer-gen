    "intro": "Polycnemum arvense subsp. majus, commonly known as the greater field sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like clusters. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. It is often found in areas with high soil moisture and can tolerate partial shade."
