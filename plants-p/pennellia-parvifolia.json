    "intro": "Pennellia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved pennellia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Its small, narrow leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that develop into small, dry fruits. Pennellia parvifolia is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental potential in native plant gardens."
