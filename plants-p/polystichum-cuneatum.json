    "intro": "Polystichum cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which develop in the late summer and early autumn. Polystichum cuneatum plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms."
