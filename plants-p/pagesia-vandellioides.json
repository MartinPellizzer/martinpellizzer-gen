    "intro": "Pagesia vandellioides, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its flowers, which range in color from white to purple, bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pagesia vandellioides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
