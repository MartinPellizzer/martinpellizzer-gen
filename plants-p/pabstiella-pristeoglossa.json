    "intro": "Pabstiella pristeoglossa, commonly known as the red-flowered rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces showy, red or reddish-brown flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
