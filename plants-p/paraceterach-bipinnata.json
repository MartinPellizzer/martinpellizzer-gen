    "intro": "Paraceterach bipinnata, commonly known as the broadleaf fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their aesthetic appeal."
