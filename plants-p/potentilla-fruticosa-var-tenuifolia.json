    "intro": "Potentilla fruticosa var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slenderleaf cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in difficult environments."
