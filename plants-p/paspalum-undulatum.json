    "intro": "Paspalum undulatum, commonly known as the wavygrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a wavy or undulating edge. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in moist or wetland habitats, such as marshes and prairies. Paspalum undulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
