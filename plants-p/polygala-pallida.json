    "intro": "Polygala pallida, commonly known as the pale milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spiky inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Polygala pallida is adapted to withstand drought and is an important component of local flora in its native range."
