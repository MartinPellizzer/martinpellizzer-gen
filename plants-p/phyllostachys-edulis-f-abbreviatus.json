    "intro": "Phyllostachys edulis f. abbreviatus, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a compact variant of the giant bamboo species. It features shorter, more densely packed culms that grow to a height of about 2 to 3 meters. The leaves are narrower and more upright compared to the standard form, giving it a more refined appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden cultivation. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to form dense, attractive clumps."
