    "intro": "Platanthera cubitalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh-orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of marshes. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern in many regions."
