    "intro": "Paspalum distichum var. tristachyum, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two rows of spikelets, giving it its specific epithet \"distichum.\" It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping and erosion control due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
