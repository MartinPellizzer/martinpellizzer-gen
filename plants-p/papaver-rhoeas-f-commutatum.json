It is characterized by its distinctive, often larger and more vibrant flowers compared to the typical Papaver rhoeas. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, black seeds. This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and potential ecological significance."
