It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in panicles during the spring. Its foliage is narrow and lance-shaped, with a pale green coloration. This bamboo is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited for shady or partially sunny environments."
