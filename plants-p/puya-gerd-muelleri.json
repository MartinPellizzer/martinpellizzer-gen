    "intro": "Puya gerd-muelleri, commonly known as the Gerd-M\u00fcller's torchflower, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. This perennial plant is characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched inflorescences bearing numerous showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservatories."
