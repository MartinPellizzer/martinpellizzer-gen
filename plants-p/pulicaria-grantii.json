    "intro": "Pulicaria grantii, commonly known as the Grant's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its adaptability to drought and heat makes it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
