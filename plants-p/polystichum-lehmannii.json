    "intro": "Polystichum lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils. Polystichum lehmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
