It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon rainforest. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest understories. Psychotria magna is also noted for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though more research is needed to fully understand its properties."
