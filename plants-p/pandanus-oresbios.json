    "intro": "Pandanus oresbios, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by fibrous, spiky fruits. Its roots are fibrous and can be used for weaving, while the leaves are valued for their durability. Pandanus oresbios thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland forest areas."
