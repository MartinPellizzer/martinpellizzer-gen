    "intro": "Poa saruwagetica, commonly known as the Saruwagetica grass, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its cold, arid habitat. Poa saruwagetica is adapted to rocky and poorly drained soils, making it a resilient component of alpine vegetation."
