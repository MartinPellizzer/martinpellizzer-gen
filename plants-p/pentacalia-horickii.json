    "intro": "Pentacalia horickii, commonly known as the Horick's pentacalia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Socotra. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant grows as a shrub, often found in rocky habitats, and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pentacalia horickii is considered a rare and endemic species."
