It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are typically narrow and serrated, with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas."
