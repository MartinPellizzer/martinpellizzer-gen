    "intro": "Parthenium argentatum var. longifolium, commonly known as the greater crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a taproot system and thrives in dry, disturbed soils, often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive hairy texture, while its stems are often branched and covered in fine hairs. This species is known for its allelopathic properties, which can inhibit the growth of other plants in its vicinity."
