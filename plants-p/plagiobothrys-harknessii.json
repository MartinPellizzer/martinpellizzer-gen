    "intro": "Plagiobothrys harknessii, commonly known as the Harkness' bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, bladder-like pods that enclose its seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces a unique, inflated fruit that aids in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
