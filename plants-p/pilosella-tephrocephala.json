    "intro": "Pilosella tephrocephala, commonly known as the snowdrop pillowweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, giving it a distinctive appearance. Pilosella tephrocephala is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
