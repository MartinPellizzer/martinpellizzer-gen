It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often hairless, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a distinct waxy coating. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. The plant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting biodiversity."
