    "intro": "Plantago fastigiata, commonly known as upright plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring a rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a useful plant for erosion control."
