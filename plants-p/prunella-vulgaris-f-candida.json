    "intro": "Prunella vulgaris f. candida, commonly known as the white dead-nettle, is a flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, square stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The flowers are small, tubular, and typically pale pink to white, arranged in dense whorls along the stem. This variety is distinguished by its predominantly white flowers, which contrast with the more common purple or pink hues of the species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
