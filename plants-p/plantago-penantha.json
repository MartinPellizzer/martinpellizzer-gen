    "intro": "Plantago penantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils such as roadsides, fields, and rocky areas. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
