    "intro": "Picea abies f. gregoryana, commonly known as the Gregory's Norway spruce, is a botanical variant of the Norway spruce, characterized by its unique growth form and foliage. It is a slow-growing evergreen conifer that typically forms dense, compact clumps, often appearing as a shrub rather than a tree. The foliage is dark green and densely packed, with needle-like leaves that are slightly shorter than those of the typical Norway spruce. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and Pyrenees, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its distinctive appearance."
