    "intro": "Podocarpus mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf podocarp, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, a feature typical of many coniferous species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
