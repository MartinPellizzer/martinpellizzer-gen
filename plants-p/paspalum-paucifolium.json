It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and arid regions. Paspalum paucifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
