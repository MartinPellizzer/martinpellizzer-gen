    "intro": "Prunus jajarkotensis, commonly known as the Jajarkot cherry, is a species of flowering plant native to the Himalayas, specifically Nepal. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its botanical features include simple, alternate leaves and a preference for well-drained soils. Prunus jajarkotensis is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in mountain ecosystems."
