    "intro": "Prunus nana var. georgica, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or George's dwarf cherry, is a compact shrub native to the Arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, typically reaching heights of only 15\u201330 cm, with dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by red or black berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in cold climates and well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant in alpine settings. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners in colder regions."
