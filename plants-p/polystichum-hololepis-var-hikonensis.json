    "intro": "Polystichum hololepis var. hikonensis, commonly known as the Hikonensis sword fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed wood fern. It is native to Japan and is characterized by its lanceolate, dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, producing new fronds from the base of the plant. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
