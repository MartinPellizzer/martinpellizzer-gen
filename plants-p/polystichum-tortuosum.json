    "intro": "Polystichum tortuosum, commonly known as the twisted fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features intricate, feather-like fronds that are deeply divided and often curl in a spiral pattern, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in the soil. The fronds are typically dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year, making it a striking addition to woodland gardens."
