    "intro": "Pseudanamomis cupuligera, commonly known as the velvet cup mushroom, is a species of fungi that belongs to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its small, cup-shaped or hoof-like cap that is typically reddish-brown in color. The stem is slender and often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. This mushroom is typically found in forested areas, growing on decaying wood or leaf litter. It is not considered edible and is often avoided due to its potentially misleading appearance."
