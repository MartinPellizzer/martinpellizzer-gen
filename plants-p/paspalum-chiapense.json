    "intro": "Paspalum chiapense, commonly known as Chiapan grass, is a perennial grass native to Central America and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and riparian zones. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Paspalum chiapense is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
