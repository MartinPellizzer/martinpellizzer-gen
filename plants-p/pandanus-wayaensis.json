    "intro": "Pandanus wayaensis, commonly known as the Waya pandanus, is a member of the Pandanaceae family, native to the tropical regions of the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with fragrant, yellowish flowers that attract various pollinators. Its roots and leaves have been traditionally used in local cultures for basket weaving and as a source of aromatic compounds. The species is often found growing near coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or moist soils."
