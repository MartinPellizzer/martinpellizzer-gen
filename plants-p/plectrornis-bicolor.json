    "intro": "Plectrornis bicolor, commonly known as the black cockatoo, is a striking bird native to Australia, characterized by its distinctive black and white plumage. While not a plant, it is often confused with botanical terms, so this query may be based on a misunderstanding. If the intent was to inquire about a plant species, please clarify the name. The term \"Plectrornis bicolor\" refers to a bird genus, not a plant, and therefore has no botanical characteristics. Please provide the correct plant name for an accurate response."
