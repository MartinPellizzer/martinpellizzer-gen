    "intro": "Pandanus rex, commonly known as the royal pandanus, is a striking tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The plant produces large, fragrant inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bats and insects. Its roots are fibrous and can be used for making rope and mats. The royal pandanus is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, thriving in humid, sunny environments."
