    "intro": "Psathyrostachys rupestris, commonly known as the rock bamboo, is a perennial grass species native to arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh, rocky environments with low water availability. Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
