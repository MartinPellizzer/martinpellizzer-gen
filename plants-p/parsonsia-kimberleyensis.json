    "intro": "Parsonsia kimberleyensis, commonly known as Kimberley flame tree, is a striking tropical shrub or small tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late winter to early spring. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a slightly waxy texture. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Parsonsia kimberleyensis is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and visually appealing plant in suitable climates."
