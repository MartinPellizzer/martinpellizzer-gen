    "intro": "Phymatodes intermedia, commonly known as the Texas knapweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
