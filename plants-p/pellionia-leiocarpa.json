    "intro": "Pellionia leiocarpa, commonly known as the silver-leafed pellionia, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial characterized by its soft, velvety foliage that often displays a silvery or grayish hue due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, arranged in clusters along the stems. Pellionia leiocarpa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value is primarily due to its attractive foliage rather than its flowers."
