    "intro": "Polypodium virginianum f. brachypteron, commonly known as the short-veined cliff fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds with short, stout pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are typically evergreen, retaining their color throughout the year, and they grow in rocky or shaded habitats. The plant's sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
