    "intro": "Polypodium catharinae var. rotundatum, commonly known as the rounded maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, finely divided fronds that exhibit a distinctive rounded shape, giving it its common name. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged along the margins of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some areas."
