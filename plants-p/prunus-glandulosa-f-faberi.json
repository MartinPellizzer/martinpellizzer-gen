    "intro": "Prunus glandulosa f. faberi, commonly known as the Chinese cherry or the fragrant cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and small, ovate leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a pale underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red or orange berries in late summer. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and showy flowers, making it a popular choice for gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, requiring moderate watering and pruning to maintain its shape."
