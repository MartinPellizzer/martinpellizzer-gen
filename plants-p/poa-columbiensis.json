    "intro": "Poa columbiensis, commonly known as the Columbia bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and open woodlands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, Poa columbiensis is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
