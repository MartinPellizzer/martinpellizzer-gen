    "intro": "Phlox longifolia var. compacta, commonly known as compact phlox, is a compact, low-growing perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, clustered clusters of pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves and a dense, mounding growth habit that makes it ideal for rock gardens or as a border plant. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, requiring minimal water once established. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
