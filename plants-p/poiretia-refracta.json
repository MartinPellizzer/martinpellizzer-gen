    "intro": "Poiretia refracta, commonly known as the refractive poiretia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
