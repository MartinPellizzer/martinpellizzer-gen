    "intro": "Piriqueta selloi var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy piriqueta, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
