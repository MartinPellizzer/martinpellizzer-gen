    "intro": "Panax innovans, commonly known as the Australian ginseng, is a rare and endemic plant found primarily in the rainforests of eastern Australia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds and other animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Panax innovans is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and medicinal research."
