    "intro": "Pulsatilla montana subsp. slaviankae, commonly known as the Slavianka pasqueflower, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its showy, early spring blooms consisting of white petals with a yellow center, which are typically borne on tall, hairy stems. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this subspecies thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and cold climates. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
