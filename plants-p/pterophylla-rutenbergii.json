    "intro": "Pterophylla rutenbergii, commonly known as the Rutenberg's pterophylla, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the arid regions of Israel. It is characterized by its unique, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its growth habit is low and spreading, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pterophylla rutenbergii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human activity."
