    "intro": "Palicourea verrucosa, commonly known as the rough palicourea, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Its roots and leaves have been traditionally used in folk medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and pharmacological studies."
