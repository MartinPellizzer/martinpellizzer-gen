    "intro": "Pseudoliparis seleniglossa, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking silver-white petals and a unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a slender tongue, giving it its scientific name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Its flowers emit a subtle fragrance, attracting specific pollinators such as moths and bees. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pseudoliparis seleniglossa is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
