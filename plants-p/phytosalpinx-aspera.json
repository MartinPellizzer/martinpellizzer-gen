It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a rough texture, which gives the species its common name. Phytosalpinx aspera is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it adapts well to poor soil conditions."
