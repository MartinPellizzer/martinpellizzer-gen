    "intro": "Prunus cerasifolia, commonly known as the Japanese cherry or yamazakura, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, edible fruits that are typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal. Prunus cerasifolia is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
