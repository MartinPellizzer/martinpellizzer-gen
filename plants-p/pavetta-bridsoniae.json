It is native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa, particularly in countries like Ghana and Nigeria. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows as an understory shrub, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
