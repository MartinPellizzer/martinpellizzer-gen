    "intro": "Pinguicula edentula, commonly known as the toothless butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that trap and digest small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually small and white or pink, producing nectar to attract pollinators. The species is notable for its lack of teeth on the leaf margins, which distinguishes it from other butterwort species."
