    "intro": "Polyplethia minor, commonly known as the lesser polyplethia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features dense, leathery leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and secondary growth areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
