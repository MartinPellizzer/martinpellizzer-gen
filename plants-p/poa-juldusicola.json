    "intro": "Poa juldusicola, commonly known as the Juldus meadowgrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Poa juldusicola is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, which produce minute seeds adapted for wind dispersal."
