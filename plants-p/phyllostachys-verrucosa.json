It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its dark, almost black, bamboo-like stems. The plant is a clump-forming bamboo that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with slender, hollow, and segmented stalks. Its leaves are narrow, elongated, and have a slightly hairy texture. Phyllostachys verrucosa is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and hardiness."
