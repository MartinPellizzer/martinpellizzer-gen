It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, spurred flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky slopes. Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
