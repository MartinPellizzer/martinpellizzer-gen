    "intro": "Panicum lucidum var. opacum, commonly known as the opacum panic grass, is a variant of the panic grass species characterized by its distinct foliage. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and more compact compared to the standard panicum lucidum. The plant produces slender, upright flowering spikes that bear small, feathery bristles, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. This variety is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique texture and drought tolerance."
