    "intro": "Poa arctica var. depauperata, commonly known as the Arctic feathergrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats close to the ground, with slender, hairless stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems."
