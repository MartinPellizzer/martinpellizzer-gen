    "intro": "Polypodium lineatum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to various regions across the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, linear fronds that are typically divided into segments, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Polypodium lineatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
