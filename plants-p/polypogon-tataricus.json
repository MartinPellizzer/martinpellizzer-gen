    "intro": "Polypogon tataricus, commonly known as Tatarian grass or Tatarian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, wastelands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
