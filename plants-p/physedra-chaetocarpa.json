    "intro": "Physedra chaetocarpa, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and ponds. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be floating or rooted in the substrate. Physedra chaetocarpa is known for its ability to photosynthesize during the day and capture prey at night."
