    "intro": "Platyclinis bistorta, commonly known as great bistort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, rhizomatous rootstock and tall, erect stems that bear lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream sides."
