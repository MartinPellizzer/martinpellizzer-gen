    "intro": "Psammisia longicolla, commonly known as the long-stemmed sandplant, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and high wind conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and yellow, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Psammisia longicolla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for native insects."
