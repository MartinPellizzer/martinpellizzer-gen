    "intro": "Psorothamnus, commonly known as the desert broom, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These shrubs typically have woody stems and small, often gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The flowers are usually yellow or cream-colored, clustered in dense, branched inflorescences, and bloom in spring. Psorothamnus species are drought-tolerant and play a role in stabilizing sandy soils in their native habitats. Their ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife."
