    "intro": "Pitcairnia heerdeae, commonly known as the Heerde's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like foliage that forms a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant red and orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically thick and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Pitcairnia heerdeae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
