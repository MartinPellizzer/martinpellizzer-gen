    "intro": "Pyrus malus var. translucens, commonly known as the translucent apple, is a rare botanical variant of the apple tree characterized by its unique translucent leaf and fruit structures. This variant exhibits a thin, waxy cuticle that allows light to pass through, giving the leaves and fruits a glass-like appearance. The translucent effect is most prominent in young leaves and under certain lighting conditions. It is believed to be a naturally occurring mutation, though its genetic basis remains poorly understood. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is highly sought after by botanists and plant collectors."
