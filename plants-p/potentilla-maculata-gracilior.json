    "intro": "Potentilla maculata gracilior, commonly known as the spotted knapweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
