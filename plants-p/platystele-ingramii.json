    "intro": "Platystele ingramii, commonly known as the Ingram's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. Native to the cloud forests of Mexico, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. The plant's unique morphology includes a single, fleshy stem that bears a single flower with three petals and three sepals. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, Platystele ingramii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
