    "intro": "Populus canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian poplar, is a large, fast-growing tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated. Its bark is smooth and light gray when young, becoming fissured with age. Populus canadensis is often used in reforestation and for its timber, which is valued for its strength and workability."
