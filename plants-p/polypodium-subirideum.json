    "intro": "Polypodium subirideum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a small evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to rocky substrates. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
