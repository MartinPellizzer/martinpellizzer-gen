    "intro": "Poa ovina var. nemoralis, commonly known as the wood meadow grass, is a variant of the sheep's fescue species. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense, mat-like growths. This plant is characterized by its fine, soft leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to colonize disturbed soils and its role in stabilizing soil in ecologically sensitive areas."
