It is characterized by its aromatic, compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal properties. Ptelea viticifolia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry landscapes."
