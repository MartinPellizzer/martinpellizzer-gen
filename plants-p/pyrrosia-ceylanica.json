    "intro": "Pyrrosia ceylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on its roots to absorb moisture from the air. Its spores are dispersed through the wind, contributing to its ability to colonize various substrates. The leaves are usually divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a distinctive, fern-like appearance."
