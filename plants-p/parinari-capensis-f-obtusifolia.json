    "intro": "Parinari capensis f. obtusifolia, commonly known as the African satinwood or smooth-leaved parinari, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It features simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a milky sap when damaged. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
