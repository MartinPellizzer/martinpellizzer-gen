    "intro": "Phyllanthus indo-myanmarensis var. puberulus, commonly known as the hairy phyllanthus, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small shrub characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The botanical features of this variety make it distinct from other Phyllanthus species, particularly in its pubescent foliage."
