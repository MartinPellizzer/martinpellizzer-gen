    "intro": "Pteris glauca, commonly known as the blue hakea, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bluish-green in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Pteris glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
