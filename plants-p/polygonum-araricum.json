    "intro": "Polygonum araricum, commonly known as the red-rooted knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its erect, somewhat hairy stems that often turn reddish in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters called spikes. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a slightly rough texture. Polygonum araricum is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as stream banks and roadsides."
