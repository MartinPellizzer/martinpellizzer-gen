    "intro": "Psittacoglossum mombachoense, commonly known as the Mombacho thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a bitter taste. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
