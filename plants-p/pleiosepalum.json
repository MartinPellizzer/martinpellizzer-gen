    "intro": "Pleiosepalum, commonly known as the star orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. They are characterized by their striking, star-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. Pleiosepalum species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, often found on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structure and their role in the biodiversity of tropical ecosystems."
