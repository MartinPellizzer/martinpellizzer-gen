    "intro": "Panicum natalense, commonly known as Natal grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open woodland and grassland habitats, often in areas with well-drained soils. The plant features slender, erect stems and produces fluffy, panicle-shaped inflorescences that are characteristic of the grass family. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture, and it is adapted to tolerate drought conditions. Natal grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
