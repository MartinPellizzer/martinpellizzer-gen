    "intro": "Paraspalathus procumbens, commonly known as the creeping paraspalathus, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for anchoring in loose, organic soil. Paraspalathus procumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
