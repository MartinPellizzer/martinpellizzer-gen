    "intro": "Pinus michoacana f. nayaritana, commonly known as the Nayarit pine, is a rare botanical variant of the Mexican pine. It is characterized by its distinctive needle-like leaves and cone structure, which are adapted to its specific ecological niche. This subspecies is native to the mountainous regions of Nayarit, Mexico, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features include a tall, straight trunk and a conical crown, typical of many pine species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
