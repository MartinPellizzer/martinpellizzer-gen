    "intro": "Paullinia riodocensis, commonly known as the Brazilian soursop, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to the common soursop but is less widely cultivated. Its botanical features include a woody stem, hairy young leaves, and a distinct aroma. It is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests."
