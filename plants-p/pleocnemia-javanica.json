    "intro": "Pleocnemia javanica, commonly known as the Javan pleated fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, pleated fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce upright, lanceolate leaves with a waxy surface. The fronds are usually dark green and have a unique, folded appearance that aids in moisture retention."
