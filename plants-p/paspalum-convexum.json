    "intro": "Paspalum convexum, commonly known as the rough paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Paspalum convexum is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry grasslands."
