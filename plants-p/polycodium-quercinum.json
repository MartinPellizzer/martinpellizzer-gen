    "intro": "Polycodium quercinum, commonly known as the oakleaf polycodium, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves with serrated edges, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense, terminal clusters during the spring season. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. Polycodium quercinum is often found in woodland edges and shaded moist soils, thriving in partial to full shade conditions."
