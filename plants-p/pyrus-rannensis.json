    "intro": "Pyrus rannensis, commonly known as the Rann Desert pear, is a shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, particularly in the Thar Desert region of India and Pakistan. The plant is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and yellow flowers that appear in spring. Its fruits are edible, though they are typically small and not widely cultivated. Pyrus rannensis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
