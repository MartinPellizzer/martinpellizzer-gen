    "intro": "Paullinia connarifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often alternate and pinnate. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic species in certain ecosystems."
