It is characterized by its pyramidal shape, needle-like leaves, and distinctive cones. The tree has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against fire and insect damage. The Douglas fir is valued for its strong, durable wood and plays an important role in forest ecosystems."
