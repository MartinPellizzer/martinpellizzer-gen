    "intro": "Plantago major var. ramosa, commonly known as the greater plantain, is a robust perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture and a distinctive central vein. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically borne on tall, erect stems. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, roadsides, and along paths. This variant is notable for its adaptability and is commonly used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
