The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
