    "intro": "Polystichum plukenetii, commonly known as the Plukenet's wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to two meters in height, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, forming dense colonies that thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Polystichum plukenetii is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
