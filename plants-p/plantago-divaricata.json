    "intro": "Plantago divaricata, commonly known as the broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features rosettes of broad, oval leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are borne on long, slender stalks. It is well adapted to grow in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a source of edible leaves in some cultures."
