    "intro": "Poa greuteri, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to form dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Poa greuteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
