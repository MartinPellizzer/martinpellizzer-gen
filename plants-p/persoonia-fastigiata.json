    "intro": "Persoonia fastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghostgum, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, which appear during the spring and summer months. Persoonia fastigiata is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or heathland environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions."
