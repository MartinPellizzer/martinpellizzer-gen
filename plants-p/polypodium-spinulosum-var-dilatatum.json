    "intro": "Polypodium spinulosum var. dilatatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved holly fern, is a terrestrial fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that are typically bipinnate. The leaves are usually dark green, with serrated margins and spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaflets compared to the typical form of Polypodium spinulosum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
