    "intro": "Padus mahaleb, commonly known as the mahaleb cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red or yellow fruits that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinct appearance. The mahaleb cherry is also valued for its fragrant wood, which is used in the production of perfumes and as a flavoring agent."
