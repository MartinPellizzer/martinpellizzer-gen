    "intro": "Pachycereus schottii var. australis, commonly known as the Australian barrel cactus, is a columnar cactus native to arid regions of Australia. It features thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 3 meters. Due to its hardiness, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
