    "intro": "Paspalum portoricense, commonly known as the Caribbean grass or coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in coastal and saline environments, making it an important component of dune vegetation. Due to its resilience to salt and wind, it is often used in ecological restoration projects along shorelines."
