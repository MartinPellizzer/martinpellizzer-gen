It features glossy, waxy leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a silvery sheen, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia hoelscheri is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and ease of care."
