It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically evergreen and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to other Phillyrea species."
