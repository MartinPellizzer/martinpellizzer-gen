It features dense, upright rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is often used as a decorative plant in terrariums and hanging baskets."
