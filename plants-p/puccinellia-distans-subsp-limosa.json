    "intro": "Puccinellia distans subsp. limosa, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to high salinity and drought conditions, making it a common component of coastal and inland salt marshes. Its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate extreme conditions makes it ecologically significant in saline habitats."
