    "intro": "Phyllostachys nigra var. nigropunctata, commonly known as the black bamboo with black dots, is a variant of the black bamboo species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black stems that are adorned with small, black dots, giving it a striking appearance. The plant is a clump-forming bamboo that grows in dense stands, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a glossy dark green color that contrasts with the black stems. This ornamental bamboo is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its visual interest."
