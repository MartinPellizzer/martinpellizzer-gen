    "intro": "Piptatherum songaricum, commonly known as the Songaric grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid regions."
