    "intro": "Polygonum viscosum var. vernicosum, commonly known as sticky smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems that are covered in a sticky, glandular substance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive waxy coating, which contributes to its sticky texture. This species is often found in moist soils along streambanks, wetlands, and disturbed areas."
