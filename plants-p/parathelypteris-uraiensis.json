It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The Urai fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
