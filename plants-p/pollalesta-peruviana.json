    "intro": "Pollalesta peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas at high altitudes. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin, nutrient-poor soil of its native habitat. Pollalesta peruviana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
