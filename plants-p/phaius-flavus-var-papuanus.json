It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clusters. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts."
