    "intro": "Polypodium \u00d7 aztecum, commonly known as the Aztec maidenhair fern, is a hybrid fern species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. The Aztec maidenhair fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
