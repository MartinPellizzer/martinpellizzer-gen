    "intro": "Polystichum praelongum, commonly known as the long-leaf fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
