    "intro": "Psilotrichum kirkii, commonly known as the Kirk's hair fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Psilotaceae, which is closely related to the more well-known genus Psilotum. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered sporangia on its fronds. Its fronds are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a finely toothed margin. Psilotrichum kirkii is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth."
