    "intro": "Potentilla anserina subvar. tenella, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an attractive ornamental plant and a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
