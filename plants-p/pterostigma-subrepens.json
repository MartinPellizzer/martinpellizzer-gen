It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are characterized by their distinct venation patterns and slightly serrated edges. Pterostigma subrepens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
