    "intro": "Psidium salutare var. strictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved guava, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are typically narrower than those of the standard guava species. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruits are generally small, round, and have a thin, smooth skin, with a sweet and aromatic pulp. The plant is often grown for its ornamental value and has some traditional medicinal uses in indigenous communities."
