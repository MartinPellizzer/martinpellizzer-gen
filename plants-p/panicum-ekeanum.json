    "intro": "Panicum ekeanum, commonly known as the Ekeanum grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as savannas and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces fluffy, panicle-like inflorescences that are often wind-pollinated. It is adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soil environments. Its growth habit makes it a useful plant for erosion control and as a forage species in some regions."
