    "intro": "Polystichum mohrioides var. lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's cliff brake, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically leathery and dark green in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in shaded forest areas. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in compact, fertile groups. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific humidity and light requirements."
