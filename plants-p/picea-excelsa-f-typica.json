    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. typica, commonly known as the whitebark pine, is a subspecies of the whitebark pine native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its distinctive, cone-like bark that is thick and scaly, providing protection against fire and harsh weather. The tree produces small, cone-shaped fruits that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it is well adapted to high-altitude environments. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in its habitat, supporting a variety of wildlife and contributing to forest biodiversity."
