    "intro": "Pyrus ignota, commonly known as the narrowleaf pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a small, edible pear that turns yellow or orange when mature. Pyrus ignota is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and chaparral."
