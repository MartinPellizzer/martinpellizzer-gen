    "intro": "Pavetta suffruticosa, commonly known as red sandalwood, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and practical properties."
