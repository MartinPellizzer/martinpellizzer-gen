    "intro": "Plantago major f. sinuata, commonly known as the broadleaf plantain, is a variant of the common plantain characterized by its broader, more sinuous leaf blades. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. The leaves are typically lance-shaped with prominent veins and a waxy surface that aids in water retention. It produces small, greenish flowers in dense spikes, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its medicinal properties."
