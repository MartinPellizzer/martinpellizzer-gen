It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It has a shallow root system and requires minimal water, making it drought-tolerant. Its growth is typically slow, and it thrives in well-draining soil."
