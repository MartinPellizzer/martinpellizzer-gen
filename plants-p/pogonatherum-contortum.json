It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has a tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often rolled or twisted, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Pogonatherum contortum is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
