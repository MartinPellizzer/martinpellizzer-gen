    "intro": "Pedicularis pseudocomosa, commonly known as the purple monkeyflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic plants. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and often lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. The species is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and cooler temperatures, often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations."
