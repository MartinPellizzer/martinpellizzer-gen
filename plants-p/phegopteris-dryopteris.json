    "intro": "Phegopteris dryopteris, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a lacy appearance. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
