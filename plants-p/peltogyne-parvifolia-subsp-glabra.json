    "intro": "Peltogyne parvifolia subsp. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, elliptical leaves that are usually glabrous or nearly hairless. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish-white, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy timber and is often found in lowland and coastal rainforest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
