    "intro": "Phacelia cumingii var. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is a short-lived perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and bluffs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. It has narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
