    "intro": "Prunus nana var. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited dwarf cherry, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, white or pale yellow fruits that are slightly tart. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant for gardens. Due to its cold hardiness, it is often used in alpine gardens and rockeries."
