It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its conical, pyramidal shape. The needles are short, dark green, and often have two white stomatal lines on their upper surface. It produces cones that are typically 3 to 5 centimeters long, containing winged seeds. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in wet, acidic soils in forested regions."
