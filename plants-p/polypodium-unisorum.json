    "intro": "Polypodium unisorum, commonly known as the single-veined fern, is a species of polypody that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically light green to dark green in color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground or over rock surfaces. Its spores are produced in small, round sori that are usually located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium unisorum is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas."
