    "intro": "Pteris austrosinica, commonly known as the southern China water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, which help in water absorption. The fronds are often divided into pinnae, which are arranged in a bipinnate pattern, giving the plant a intricate and elegant appearance."
