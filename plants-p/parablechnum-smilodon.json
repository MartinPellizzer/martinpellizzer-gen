    "intro": "Parablechnum smilodon, commonly known as the giant lichen, is a unique species that exhibits both algal and fungal components. It belongs to the order Lecanorales and is characterized by its complex thallus structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. It is typically found on rocky surfaces in arid or semi-arid regions. Its slow growth rate and ability to survive extreme conditions make it an important indicator of environmental stability."
