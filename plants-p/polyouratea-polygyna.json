    "intro": "Polyouratea polygyna, commonly known as the Indian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with four to five petals. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
