    "intro": "Phyllanthus amarus, commonly known as the stonebreaker or false crossandra, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring opposite, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Phyllanthus amarus is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, including its use in treating liver disorders and as an antimicrobial agent."
