    "intro": "Parasenecio quinquelobus var. sinuatus, commonly known as the sinuate parasenecio, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often exhibit a sinuous or wavy margin, giving it its varietal name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
