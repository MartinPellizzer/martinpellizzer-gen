    "intro": "Pedicularis borealis, commonly known as the Arctic beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, adapted to attract pollinators in cold environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Pedicularis borealis thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found growing in rocky or gravelly habitats."
