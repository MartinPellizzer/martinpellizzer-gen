    "intro": "Pavetta insulana, commonly known as the Island Pavetta, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and a slightly serrated margin. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom during the rainy season. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
