    "intro": "Polygonum aubertii, commonly known as the Japanese knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly and become invasive in non-native regions. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wetlands. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a noxious weed in many parts of the world."
