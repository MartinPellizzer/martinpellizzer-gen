It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces large, clustered inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers, which are often used in traditional crafts and ceremonies. Its robust growth habit makes it suitable for coastal and humid environments. The foliage is often used for thatching and weaving, contributing to its cultural significance in island communities."
