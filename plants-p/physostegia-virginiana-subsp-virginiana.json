It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has lance-shaped leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, rich soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
