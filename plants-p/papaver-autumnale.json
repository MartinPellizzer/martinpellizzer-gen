It produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. The flowers are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and can also serve as a food source for pollinators."
