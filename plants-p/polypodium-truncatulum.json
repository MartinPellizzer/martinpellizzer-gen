    "intro": "Polypodium truncatulum, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in humid environments and often grows on trees or rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. Polypodium truncatulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in shaded gardens."
