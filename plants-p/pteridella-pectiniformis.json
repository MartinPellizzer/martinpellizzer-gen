    "intro": "Pteridella pectiniformis, commonly known as the feather fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are divided into numerous small, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new fronds. Pteridella pectiniformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
