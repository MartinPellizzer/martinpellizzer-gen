    "intro": "Pamianthe ecollis, commonly known as the mountain starflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens for its ornamental value."
