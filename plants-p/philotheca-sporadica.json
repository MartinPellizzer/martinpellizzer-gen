    "intro": "[WRONG START] Philoteca sporadica, commonly known as the rare mountain pepper, is a flowering plant native to the wet sclerophyll forests of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain two seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Philotheca sporadica is a low-growing shrub, typically reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
