    "intro": "Phlox involucrata, commonly known as the garden phlox, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and showy clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of downy hair. Phlox involucrata thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soil."
