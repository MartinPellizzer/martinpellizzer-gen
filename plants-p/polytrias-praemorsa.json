    "intro": "Polytrias praemorsa, commonly known as the death's-head hawkmoth, is a striking plant with distinctive botanical features. It belongs to the family Strychnaceae and is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color, which help it blend into its natural habitat. Its structure is adapted for insect pollination, with nectar-rich blossoms attracting various pollinators. Despite its name, it is not related to the hawkmoth but is named for its resemblance to the insect's head."
