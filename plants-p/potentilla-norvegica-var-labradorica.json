It features small, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has wiry, thornless stems and broad, oval leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its hardy nature makes it adaptable to cold climates and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
