    "intro": "Pitcairnia oranensis, commonly known as the Orange Pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that ranges from orange to red, which is particularly notable during its flowering period. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are long, narrow, and form a rosette that helps collect water, a common adaptation in tropical environments. Pitcairnia oranensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
