    "intro": "Pabstiella savioi, commonly known as the Savio's pabstiella, is a rare and specialized member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, umbellate flowers that typically bloom in late summer. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense, low-growing clumps. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Pabstiella savioi is considered a delicate and endangered species."
