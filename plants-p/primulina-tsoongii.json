    "intro": "Primulina tsoongii, commonly known as the Tsoong's globose arrowhead, is a rare and endangered species native to China. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family, characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually bright red or orange and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
