    "intro": "Polypodium biseriale, commonly known as the two-veined fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into two distinct veins. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The plant's intricate leaf structure and adaptability to various substrates make it a notable species in botanical studies."
