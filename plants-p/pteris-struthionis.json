    "intro": "Pteris struthionis, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant thrives in wet, shady environments, often found near streams or in marshy areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in moist soil. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting insects for pollination."
