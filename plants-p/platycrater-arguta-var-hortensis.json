It features attractive, showy inflorescences composed of numerous small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with dense foliage that turns red in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce clusters of berries in the autumn."
