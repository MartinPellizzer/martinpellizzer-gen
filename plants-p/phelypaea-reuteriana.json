    "intro": "Phelypaea reuteriana, commonly known as the Reuter's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form a network that helps anchor it to submerged surfaces. The spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle."
