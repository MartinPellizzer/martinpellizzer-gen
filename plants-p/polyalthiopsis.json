    "intro": "Polyalthiopsis, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Annonaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and ornamental value. The leaves are typically glossy and dark green, with a waxy texture that gives the plant its common name. Polyalthiopsis species often grow as small to medium-sized trees, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. They are valued in horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and are sometimes cultivated as ornamental plants in tropical gardens."
