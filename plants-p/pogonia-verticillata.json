    "intro": "Pogonia verticillata, commonly known as the little pink or the zigzag orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and its distinctive pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires specific soil conditions for successful growth. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The species is relatively rare and is often found in small, scattered populations across its range."
