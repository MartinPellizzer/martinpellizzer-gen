    "intro": "Podocarpus thunbergii, commonly known as the Japanese yew or Chinese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to eastern Asia. It features a conical or rounded crown with dense, dark green foliage that remains throughout the year. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years, typically releasing seeds in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Podocarpus thunbergii is also valued for its durable wood, which has been used historically in construction and furniture making."
