    "intro": "Picea orientalis var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf fir, is a variant of the oriental fir native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and long, slender needles that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that hang downward, a feature that distinguishes it from other fir species. Its foliage is dense and provides good wind resistance, making it suitable for windbreaks. The longifolia variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
