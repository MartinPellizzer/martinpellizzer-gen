    "intro": "Panicum joshuae, commonly known as Joshua's grass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Panicum joshuae is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
