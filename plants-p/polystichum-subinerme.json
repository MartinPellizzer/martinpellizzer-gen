    "intro": "Polystichum subinerme, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and densely packed. The plant grows in shady, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a common sight in forest understories. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
