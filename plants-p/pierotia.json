    "intro": "Pierotia, commonly known as the \"peacock flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble peacock feathers, which are often mistaken for actual flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, with alternate, simple leaves that are usually green and lance-shaped. Pierotia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia. They thrive in well-drained soil and require full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
