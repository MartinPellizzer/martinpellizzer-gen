    "intro": "Prunus padus var. pubescens, commonly known as the downy whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy (pubescent) stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are often consumed by birds. It thrives in a variety of soils but prefers well-drained conditions and partial shade. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in woodland habitats."
