    "intro": "Potentilla congesta var. congesta, commonly known as the dense potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, many-branched stems covered in dense, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
