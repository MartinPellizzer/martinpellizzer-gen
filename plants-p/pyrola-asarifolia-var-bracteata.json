    "intro": "Pyrola asarifolia var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It features whorled, ovate, leathery leaves that are dark green and remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring, which are borne on short, hairy stalks. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils under the canopy of coniferous or mixed forests."
