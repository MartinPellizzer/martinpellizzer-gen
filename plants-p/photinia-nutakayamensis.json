    "intro": "Photinia nutakayamensis, commonly known as the Nilgiri photinia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in dense forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
