    "intro": "Prinos coriaceus var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf prinos, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, elongated, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round berries. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valued plant in horticulture."
