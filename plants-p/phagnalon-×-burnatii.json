    "intro": "Phagnalon \u00d7 burnatii, commonly known as the hybrid meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe. It is a hybrid between Phagnalon lobatum and Phagnalon saxatile, characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in disturbed or marginal areas where other plants struggle to establish."
