    "intro": "Polypleurum wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and streams at high altitudes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is an important indicator species for freshwater ecosystems in its native range."
