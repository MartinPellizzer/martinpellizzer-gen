    "intro": "Pilosocereus gounellei subsp. zehntneri, commonly known as the Zehntner's pincushion cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a slow-growing cactus characterized by its dense, spiny, globular shape and thick, ribbed stems. The plant produces small, white flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water due to its adaptation to desert environments. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
