    "intro": "Polakia paradoxa, commonly known as the paradoxical polakia, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet, with thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains several seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
