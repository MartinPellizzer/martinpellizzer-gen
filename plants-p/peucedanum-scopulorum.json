    "intro": "Peucedanum scopulorum, commonly known as the rock angelica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
