    "intro": "Polypodium leptophyllum, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows on the trunks of trees or on rocky surfaces in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizome that sends out stolons, which produce new fronds. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with slender, linear pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. The species is adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor conditions, making it a characteristic component of forest understories."
