    "intro": "Persea gracillima, commonly known as the slender avocado, is a small evergreen tree native to Mexico. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to avocados but smaller. Its fruit has a smooth, dark purple skin and a creamy, nutty flesh. Persea gracillima is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in its native habitat."
