    "intro": "Polygala undulata, commonly known as the wavy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Polygalaceae family, which includes over 700 species of flowering plants. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves and small, clustered flowers. It produces small, yellow or greenish flowers that are often arranged in spirals along the stems. Polygala undulata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
