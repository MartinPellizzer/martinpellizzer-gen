    "intro": "Phippsia arctica, commonly known as the Arctic phippsia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and needle-like, which helps reduce water loss in its arid, frost-prone environment. Phippsia arctica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying Arctic flora."
