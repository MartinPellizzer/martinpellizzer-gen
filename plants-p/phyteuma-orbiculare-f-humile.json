    "intro": "Phyteuma orbiculare f. humile, commonly known as the dwarf globe gentian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compact, rosette-forming foliage with dark green, hairy leaves that are orbicular in shape. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
