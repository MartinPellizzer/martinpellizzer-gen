    "intro": "Pimpinella ambigua, commonly known as the cow parsley or wild angelica, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small white or greenish-yellow flowers appear in umbrella-like clusters, and the plant produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Pimpinella ambigua is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
