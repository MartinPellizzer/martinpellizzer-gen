It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often striking flowers. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
