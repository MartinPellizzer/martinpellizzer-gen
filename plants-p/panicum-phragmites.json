    "intro": "Panicum phragmites, commonly known as common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous growth and tall, cylindrical spikes of small, greenish-brown flowers. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its rhizomes spread extensively, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. Panicum phragmites plays an important ecological role in wetlands by filtering water and preventing erosion."
