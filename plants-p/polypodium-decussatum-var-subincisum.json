    "intro": "Polypodium decussatum var. subincisum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its pinnately compound leaves that are typically narrow and have a subincised margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its fronds are leathery and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a distinctive shield-shaped base. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
