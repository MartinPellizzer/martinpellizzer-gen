    "intro": "Pandanus gladiifolius, commonly known as the sword-leaf pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Pandanaceae. It is native to the Pacific Islands and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as thatch material due to their durability. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils."
