    "intro": "Phyllostachys heterocycla f. quadrangulata, commonly known as the bamboo, is a cold-hardy grass species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrilateral stems, which give it a unique, angular appearance. The plant is a clump-forming perennial, often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it adaptable to various climates. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
