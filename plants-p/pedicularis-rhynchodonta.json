    "intro": "Pedicularis rhynchodonta, commonly known as the horned monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a parasitic plant. The plant produces striking, spurred flowers that are typically red or orange in color, with a distinctive horn-like projection on the lip. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
