    "intro": "Ptilotus astrolasius, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its striking, pale pink to white, star-shaped flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions make it a notable species in its native habitat. The ghost flower is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
