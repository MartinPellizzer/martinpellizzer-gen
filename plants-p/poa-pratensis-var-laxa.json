    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. laxa, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a variant of the common tall fescue. It is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often found in moist meadows and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its slightly floppy growth habit and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Botanically, it is distinguished by its reduced leaf auricles and shorter, more loosely arranged spikelets compared to the typical Poa pratensis."
