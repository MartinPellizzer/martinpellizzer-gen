    "intro": "Psilocaulon imitans, commonly known as the false psilocybe, is a species of fungus belonging to the family Psilocybe. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped cap that becomes convex with age, and a pale to yellowish stem. The gills are closely spaced and initially pink, fading to a pale brown as they mature. This species is often mistaken for true psilocybin mushrooms due to its similar appearance. It is typically found in grassy areas and is not considered psychoactive."
