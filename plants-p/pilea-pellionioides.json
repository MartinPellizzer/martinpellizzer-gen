    "intro": "Pilea pellionioides, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to China. It features round, waxy leaves that resemble small coins, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact growth habit makes it an ideal houseplant for indoor spaces."
