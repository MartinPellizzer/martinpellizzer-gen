    "intro": "Psammisia oblongifolia, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife. Psammisia oblongifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
