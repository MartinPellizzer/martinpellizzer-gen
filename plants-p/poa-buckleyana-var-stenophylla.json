    "intro": "Poa buckleyana var. stenophylla, commonly known as Buckley's meadowgrass, is a variety of the meadowgrass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and open woodlands. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
