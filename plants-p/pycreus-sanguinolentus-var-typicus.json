    "intro": "Pycreus sanguinolentus var. typicus, commonly known as the Crimson Vein Orchid, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, velvety petals that display a deep crimson hue with intricate veining patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soil and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring and are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialized horticulturists."
