    "intro": "Plantago strigosa, commonly known as stiffleaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces erect flowering stems that bear clusters of small, greenish flowers, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes."
