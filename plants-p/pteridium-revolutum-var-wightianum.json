    "intro": "Pteridium revolutum var. wightianum, commonly known as the Wight's brake, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. The varietal form wightianum is distinguished by specific morphological traits, including the shape and arrangement of its leaves."
