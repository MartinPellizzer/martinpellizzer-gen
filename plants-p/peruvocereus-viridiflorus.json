    "intro": "Peruvocereus viridiflorus, commonly known as the green-flowered cactus, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stems and sparse, spiny areoles. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a unique aesthetic to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the botanical world."
