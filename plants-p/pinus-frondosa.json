    "intro": "Pinus frondosa, commonly known as the longleaf pine, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, slender needles that grow in bundles of three, and its distinctive, often fire-resistant trunk. The tree produces cones that mature over two years, with the outer scales falling off to release the seeds. Its root system is extensive and helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in its habitat. The longleaf pine is also notable for its ability to withstand frequent forest fires, which has shaped its ecological role in the region."
