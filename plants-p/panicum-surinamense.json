    "intro": "Panicum surinamense, commonly known as Surinam grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often found near rivers and swamps. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
