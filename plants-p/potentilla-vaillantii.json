    "intro": "Potentilla vaillantii, commonly known as the Vaillant's cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30-60 cm, featuring wiry stems and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are composed of numerous tiny petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in colder climates."
