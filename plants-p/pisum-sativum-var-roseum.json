    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. roseum, commonly known as the pink-flowered garden pea, is a cultivar of the common pea plant characterized by its distinctive pink or lavender-colored flowers. This variety is typically grown for ornamental purposes due to its attractive blooms, though it can also produce edible pods similar to other pea varieties. The plant is a climbing legume with trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in cool climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth. The pink-flowered garden pea is often used in gardens to add color and attract pollinators."
