    "intro": "Phlomis balearica, commonly known as the Balearic flax or narrow-leaved phlomis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Phlomis balearica is valued for its ornamental beauty and drought tolerance."
