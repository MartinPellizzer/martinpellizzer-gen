    "intro": "Potentilla latestipula var. argentata, commonly known as silver potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on the leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, preferring cooler climates."
