    "intro": "Protowoodsia manchuriensis, commonly known as the Manchurian protowoodsia, is a rare fern native to northeastern China. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research."
