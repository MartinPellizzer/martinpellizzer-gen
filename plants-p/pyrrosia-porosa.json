    "intro": "Pyrrosia porosa, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to East Asia. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a delicate, wiry rhizome and produces small, lance-shaped fronds with a glossy, dark green appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Pyrrosia porosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
