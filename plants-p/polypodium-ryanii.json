    "intro": "Polypodium ryanii, commonly known as the Ryan's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish spores. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and often form a dense network, allowing it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich substrates. Polypodium ryanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
