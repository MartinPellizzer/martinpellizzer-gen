    "intro": "Peperomia famelica, commonly known as the velvet leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen perennial shrub native to tropical regions. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which are followed by tiny, round berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia famelica is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
