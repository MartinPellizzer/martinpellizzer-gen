    "intro": "Pteris cadieri subsp. walkeri, commonly known as the walking fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique rhizome system that allows it to \"walk\" across surfaces. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features feather-like fronds with a distinctive, undulating appearance. Its sporangia are arranged in clusters along the margins of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
