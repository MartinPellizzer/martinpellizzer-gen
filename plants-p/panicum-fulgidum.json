    "intro": "Panicum fulgidum, commonly known as golden panicum, is a species of grass native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, clump-forming growth habit and its striking golden-yellow inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds visual interest throughout the growing season. Panicum fulgidum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
