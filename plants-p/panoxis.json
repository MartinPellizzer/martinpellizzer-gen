    "intro": "Panoxis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species found in specific tropical regions. It is characterized by its unique, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the light, giving it its otherworldly appearance. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Panoxis blooms only during the full moon, a phenomenon that has sparked both scientific curiosity and local folklore. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare botanical specimen."
