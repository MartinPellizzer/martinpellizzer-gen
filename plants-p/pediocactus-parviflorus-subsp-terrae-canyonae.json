    "intro": "Pediocactus parviflorus subsp. terrae-canyonae, commonly known as the Terrae-Canyon Hedgehog Cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It features short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
