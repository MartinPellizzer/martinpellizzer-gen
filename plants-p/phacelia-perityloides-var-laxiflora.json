    "intro": "Phacelia perityloides var. laxiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
