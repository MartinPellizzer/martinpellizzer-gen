    "intro": "Parathelypteris singalanensis, commonly known as the Singalana shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by indusia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its natural habitat, making it a notable example of fern diversity in the region."
