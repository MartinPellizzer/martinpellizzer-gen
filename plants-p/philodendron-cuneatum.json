It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy sheen. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by yellowish berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth. Philodendron cuneatum is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
