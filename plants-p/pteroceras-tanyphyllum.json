    "intro": "Pteroceras tanyphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pteroceras, is a rare and delicate fern-like plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical forests. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
