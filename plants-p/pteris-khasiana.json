    "intro": "Pteris khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi water fern, is a species of fern native to the northeastern regions of India. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles a fern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia, which are responsible for the plant's reproductive cycle. Pteris khasiana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
