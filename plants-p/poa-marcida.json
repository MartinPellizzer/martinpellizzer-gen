    "intro": "Poa marcida, commonly known as the soft bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Poa marcida is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in other disturbed habitats where it can form dense, low-growing vegetation."
