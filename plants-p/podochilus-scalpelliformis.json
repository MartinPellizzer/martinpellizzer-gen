    "intro": "Podochilus scalpelliformis, commonly known as the scalpel-shaped fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies or near streams. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The species is native to Southeast Asia and is valued both for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
