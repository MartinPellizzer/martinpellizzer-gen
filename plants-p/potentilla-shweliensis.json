    "intro": "Potentilla shweliensis, commonly known as the Shweli cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are usually serrated and hairy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Potentilla shweliensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
