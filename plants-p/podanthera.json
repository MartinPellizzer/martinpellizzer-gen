    "intro": "Podanthera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, making it a unique epiphytic species. Podanthera is often found growing on the branches of rainforest trees, thriving in humid and shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
