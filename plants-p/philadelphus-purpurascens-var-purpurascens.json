The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to both native plant gardens and wildlife habitats."
