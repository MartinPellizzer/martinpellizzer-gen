    "intro": "Polygala abyssinica var. subaphylla, commonly known as the Abyssinian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
