    "intro": "Pleopeltis pseudoloxogramma, commonly known as the false loxogramma fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has slender, arching fronds with a bipinnate structure, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its spores are produced in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. The plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid conditions."
