    "intro": "Pelargonium patulum var. tenuilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed geranium, is a compact, trailing plant native to South Africa. It features rounded, fleshy leaves with a distinctive narrow, lobed shape, often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its vibrant floral display."
