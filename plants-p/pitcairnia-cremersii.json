    "intro": "Pitcairnia cremersii, commonly known as the Cremers' pitcairnia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure with thick, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
