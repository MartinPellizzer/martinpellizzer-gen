    "intro": "Pseudoraphis squarrosa var. depauperata, commonly known as the sparse-haired pseudoraphis, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and adapted to store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
