    "intro": "Planarium latisiliquum, commonly known as the broad-silvery planarian, is a species of flatworm found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like body covered in a smooth, translucent cuticle. The worm exhibits a distinctive silvery sheen, particularly noticeable under light, which gives it its common name. It is typically found in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it feeds on small aquatic organisms. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to researchers studying freshwater ecosystems."
