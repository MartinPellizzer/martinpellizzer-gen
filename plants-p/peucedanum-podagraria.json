    "intro": "Peucedanum podagraria, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a tall, hollow stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. However, it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities, causing skin irritation and gastrointestinal issues."
