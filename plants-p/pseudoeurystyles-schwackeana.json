    "intro": "Pseudoeurystyles schwackeana, commonly known as the Schwacke's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with elongated, white or pale green leaves and a single, showy flower that resembles a ghostly face. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in the understory of forests. It has a specialized root system that forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi to absorb nutrients. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
