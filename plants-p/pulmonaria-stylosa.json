    "intro": "Pulmonaria stylosa, commonly known as the slender lungwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, heart-shaped leaves and tall, erect stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in partial shade. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pulmonaria stylosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and early season blooms."
