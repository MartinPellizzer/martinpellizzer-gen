    "intro": "Paspalum confertum, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is well adapted to salt spray and periodic flooding. Paspalum confertum is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
