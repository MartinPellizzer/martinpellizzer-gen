It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, featuring a rounded crown and dark green, lobed leaves. The tree produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by ornamental, yellowish-green fruits. Its fruit is often used for culinary purposes, though it is less common than other pear varieties. The hybrid is valued for its hardiness and adaptability to various climates."
