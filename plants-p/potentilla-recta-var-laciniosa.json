    "intro": "Potentilla recta var. laciniosa, commonly known as the laceleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
