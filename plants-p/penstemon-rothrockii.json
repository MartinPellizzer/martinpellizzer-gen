It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Penstemon rothrockii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
