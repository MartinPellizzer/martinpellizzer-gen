    "intro": "Puccinellia peisonis, commonly known as the coastal grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to coastal and maritime environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in these sensitive ecosystems. Puccinellia peisonis is also valued for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, including high salinity and strong winds."
