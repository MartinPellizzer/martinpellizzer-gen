    "intro": "Phaeocephalum leptorhynchum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed phaeocephalum, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender stems and finely divided, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It is native to temperate regions of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
