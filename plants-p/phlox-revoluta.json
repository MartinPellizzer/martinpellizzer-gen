    "intro": "Phlox revoluta, commonly known as the mountain phlox, is a flowering plant native to the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches, featuring upright stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped, opposite, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Phlox revoluta thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
