    "intro": "Polygonum odoratum, commonly known as the sweet potato vine, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Polygonum odoratum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage rather than its flowers."
