It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it contributes to soil stabilization. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological studies and habitat conservation efforts."
