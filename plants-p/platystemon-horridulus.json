    "intro": "Platystemon horridulus, commonly known as the rough platystemon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in dense, terminal inflorescences. Its stems are slender and branching, often remaining close to the ground. Platystemon horridulus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
