    "intro": "Pandanus aruensis, commonly known as the Aru pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that develop into fibrous, spiky fruits. Its leaves are fibrous and have a strong, woody texture, making them valuable for weaving. Pandanus aruensis thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and humid environments."
