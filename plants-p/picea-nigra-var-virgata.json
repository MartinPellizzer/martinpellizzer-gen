    "intro": "Picea nigra var. virgata, commonly known as the Virgin's pine, is a variant of the black spruce native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and conical shape. The tree produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in boreal forests and wetland areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological stability and forest ecosystems."
