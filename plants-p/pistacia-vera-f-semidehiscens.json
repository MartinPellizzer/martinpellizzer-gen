    "intro": "Pistacia vera f. semidehiscens, commonly known as the semi-dehiscent pistachio, is a cultivated variant of the pistachio tree. It is characterized by its unique fruiting behavior, where the husk partially opens instead of fully splitting, making it easier to harvest. The plant is native to the Middle East and is widely grown for its edible nuts. Its botanical features include lanceolate leaves and yellowish-green flowers. This form is valued in agriculture for its improved yield and reduced labor in nut collection."
