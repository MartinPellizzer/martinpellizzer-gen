The plant has slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered in panicles, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Paspalum soboliferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
