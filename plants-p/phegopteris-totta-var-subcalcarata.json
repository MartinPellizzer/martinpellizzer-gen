    "intro": "Phegopteris totta var. subcalcarata, commonly known as the fringed holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a fringed appearance along the edges, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, with a deep green color that often has a slightly glossy sheen. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
