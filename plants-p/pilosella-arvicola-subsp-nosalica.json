    "intro": "Pilosella arvicola subsp. nosalica, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones. Its leaves are usually grayish-green and covered with fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Pilosella arvicola subsp. nosalica is a member of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
