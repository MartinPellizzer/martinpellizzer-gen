It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters of five. The plant has thin, wiry stems and serrated, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Potentilla trullifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
