    "intro": "Panicum praetervisum, commonly known as the neglected panicgrass, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in wet conditions and its tolerance to periodic flooding. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
