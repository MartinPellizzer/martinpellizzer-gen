    "intro": "Potentilla argentea var. guentheriana, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It features finely divided, silver-white leaves that give it a distinctive appearance, and it produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine. Its botanical name reflects its silver foliage and its classification within the genus Potentilla."
