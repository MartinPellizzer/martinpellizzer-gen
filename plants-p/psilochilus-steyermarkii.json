    "intro": "Psilochilus steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's psilochilus, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, with a distinct labellum that contributes to its ornamental appeal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
