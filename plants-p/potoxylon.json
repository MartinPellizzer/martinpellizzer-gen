    "intro": "Potoxylon, commonly known as the desert candle, is a shrub native to arid regions of North America. It has a distinctive, candle-like shape with a thick, woody stem and small, narrow leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments by storing water in its stem and reducing transpiration. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and bloom in the spring. Potoxylon plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
