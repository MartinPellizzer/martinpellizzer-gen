It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often forming dense mats on the water surface. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, round fruits. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
