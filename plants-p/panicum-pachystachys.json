It is characterized by its striking red or purple foliage, which becomes more vivid as the plant matures. The plant produces tall, slender spikes of small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and ornamental gardens. Its unique coloration and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
