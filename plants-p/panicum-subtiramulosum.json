    "intro": "Panicum subtiramulosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive reddish tint, and its inflorescence consists of loose, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
