    "intro": "Polypodium flocculosum, commonly known as the fluff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium flocculosum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid conditions."
