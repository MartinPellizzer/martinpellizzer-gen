    "intro": "Pentacalia moaensis, commonly known as the Maori's ghost or the ghost plant, is a rare flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Pentacalia moaensis is considered critically endangered."
