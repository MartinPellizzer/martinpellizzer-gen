    "intro": "Prunus persica f. caryophyllodes, commonly known as the clustered peach, is a cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its unique floral structure. It features dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding ornamental value to the plant. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate with a glossy green surface. While it produces small, edible fruits, its primary appeal lies in its showy floral display. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic contribution rather than its fruit yield."
