It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Phlox setacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
