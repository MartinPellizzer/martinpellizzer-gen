    "intro": "Pogonatherum huillense, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of many grass species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midvein, and it thrives in moist, temperate climates. Pogonatherum huillense is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
