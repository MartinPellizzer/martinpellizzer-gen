    "intro": "Phyllorkis minuta, commonly known as the minute phyllorkis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
