    "intro": "Palisota decumbens, commonly known as the creeping water plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with thin, wiry stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Palisota decumbens is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions."
