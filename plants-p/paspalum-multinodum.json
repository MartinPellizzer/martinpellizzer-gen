    "intro": "Paspalum multinodum, commonly known as the clustered grass or nodding paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Paspalum multinodum is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
