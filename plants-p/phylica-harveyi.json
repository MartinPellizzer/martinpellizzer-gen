    "intro": "Phylica harveyi, commonly known as the Natal glory bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and showy, red or orange flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are leathery and glossy, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Phylica harveyi is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates."
