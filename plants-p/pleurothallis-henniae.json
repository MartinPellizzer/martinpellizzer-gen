The plant features delicate, narrow leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its floral structure is typical of the genus, with a slender column and spurred lip. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate species with limited cultivation success outside its natural range."
