    "intro": "Psilostrophe hartmanii, commonly known as Hartman's psilostrophe, is a rare and endangered plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
