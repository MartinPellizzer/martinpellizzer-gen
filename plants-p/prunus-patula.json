It is characterized by its showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The tree has a compact, rounded shape with smooth, dark bark and ovate, glossy leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and parks. Prunus patula is also valued for its cultural significance in Japanese tradition and its role in spring festivals."
