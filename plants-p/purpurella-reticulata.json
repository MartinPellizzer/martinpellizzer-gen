    "intro": "Purpurella reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined orchid, is a delicate flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and white. The leaves are linear and slightly hairy, contributing to its unique appearance. This species thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
