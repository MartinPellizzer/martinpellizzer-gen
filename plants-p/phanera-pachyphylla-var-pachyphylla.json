    "intro": "Phanera pachyphylla var. pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved phanera, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, a feature adapted to its dry environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the rainy season. Its bark is smooth and greyish, and it has a woody stem that can become branched with age. This species is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
