    "intro": "Polygala pumila, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features slender, wiry stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant has small, needle-like leaves and produces pods that contain minute, hard seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Polygala pumila is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
