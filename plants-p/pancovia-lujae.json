    "intro": "Pancovia lujae, commonly known as the Lujan's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique growth habit that involves epiphytic attachment to tree bark. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the wet season, typically in the late spring. Its botanical features include a slender stem and a specialized root system adapted for nutrient absorption from the air. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Pancovia lujae is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
