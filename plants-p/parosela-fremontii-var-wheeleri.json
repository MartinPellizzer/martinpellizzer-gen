    "intro": "Parosela fremontii var. wheeleri, commonly known as the Wheeler's parosela, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in specific regions of the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb with slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
