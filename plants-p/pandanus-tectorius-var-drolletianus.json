    "intro": "Pandanus tectorius var. drolletianus, commonly known as the dwarf pandanus, is a compact variant of the pandanus genus native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its short, broad leaves that form a dense, rounded canopy, giving it a bushy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear fragrant, yellowish flowers, which are often used in traditional crafts and ceremonies. Its adaptability to coastal and tropical environments makes it a resilient ornamental plant. The species is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
