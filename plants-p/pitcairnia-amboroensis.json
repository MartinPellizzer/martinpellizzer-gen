    "intro": "Pitcairnia amboroensis, commonly known as the Ambor\u00f3 pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Bolivia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy inflorescence that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant red bracts that surround its small, white flowers, creating a dramatic visual display. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pitcairnia amboroensis is also noted for its ability to form dense clumps, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical regions."
