    "intro": "Phelypaea rosmarini, commonly known as the rosmarinia fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often used in horticultural displays. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Phelypaea rosmarini is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
