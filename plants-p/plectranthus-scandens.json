    "intro": "Plectranthus scandens, commonly known as creeping plectranthus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing, trailing plant with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or blue, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a popular choice for both ornamental and medicinal uses."
