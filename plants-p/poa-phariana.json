    "intro": "Poa phariana, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with red or purple. Poa phariana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
