    "intro": "Philadelphus laniger, commonly known as the woolly mock orange, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, often in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its hardiness and showy blooms, it is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
