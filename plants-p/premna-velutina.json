    "intro": "Premna velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf or Indian nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy or velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries that turn dark when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
