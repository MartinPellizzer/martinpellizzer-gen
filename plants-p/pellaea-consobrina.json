It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to anchor itself to rocky substrates. Pellaea consobrina is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
