It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. It produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by its edible, though tart, fruits. This species is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils."
