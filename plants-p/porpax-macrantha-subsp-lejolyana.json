    "intro": "Porpax macrantha subsp. lejolyana, commonly known as the Cape mountain heath, is a shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often with a slight blue-gray hue, and it is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
