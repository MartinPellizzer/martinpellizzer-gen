    "intro": "Pereskia undulata, commonly known as the waxy cactus or zigzag cactus, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Pereskia undulata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
