    "intro": "Pogonia velutina, commonly known as the velvet twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, pale pink or white flower with a distinctive hooded labellum. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its blooming period occurs from June to August, and it is considered a rare and endangered species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
