    "intro": "Polystichum kwakiutlii, commonly known as the Kwak\u2019wak\u2019wak fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically arched or ascending. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
