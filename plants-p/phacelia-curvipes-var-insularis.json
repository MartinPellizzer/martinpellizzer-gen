    "intro": "Phacelia curvipes var. insularis, commonly known as the island phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across the islands. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
