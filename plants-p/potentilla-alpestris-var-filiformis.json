    "intro": "Potentilla alpestris var. filiformis, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats, adapted to harsh mountain environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or alpine arrangements."
