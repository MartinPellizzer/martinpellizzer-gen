It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with a slender stem and small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its seeds are small and dry, often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties.
