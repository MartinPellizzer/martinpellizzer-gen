    "intro": "Phylica excelsa var. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved silver bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the winter months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for garden planting in arid regions."
