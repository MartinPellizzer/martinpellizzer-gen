    "intro": "Polystachya cultriformis, commonly known as the cultriform spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, sword-shaped leaves and distinctive inflorescence that bears multiple racemes of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its flowers are often short-lived but attract various pollinators, including bees and flies. Polystachya cultriformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
