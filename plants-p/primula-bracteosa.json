    "intro": "Primula bracteosa, commonly known as the bracteosa primrose, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, brightly colored flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky slopes. The flowers bloom in early spring, making it a valuable early-season nectar source for pollinators."
