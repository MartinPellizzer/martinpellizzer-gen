    "intro": "Pleurospermum crassicaule, commonly known as the broad-leaved pleurospermum, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching towards the top. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in the summer, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and have a distinctive waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance. This species is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
