    "intro": "Polycarena capensis, commonly known as the Cape polycarp, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Polycarena capensis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in Mediterranean climates."
