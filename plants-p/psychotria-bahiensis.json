    "intro": "Psychotria bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, dark blue to black berries that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. Psychotria bahiensis is also noted for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
