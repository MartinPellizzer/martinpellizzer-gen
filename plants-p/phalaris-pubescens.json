    "intro": "Phalaris pubescens, commonly known as hairy grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny greenish or pale blue flowers. It is typically found in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, ditches, and along riverbanks. Phalaris pubescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
