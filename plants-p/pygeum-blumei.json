    "intro": "Pygeum blumei, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by yellowish-orange fruits containing three to four seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
