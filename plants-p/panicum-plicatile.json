    "intro": "Panicum plicatile, commonly known as the narrow-leaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and ecological restoration projects."
