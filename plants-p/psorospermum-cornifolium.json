    "intro": "Psorospermum cornifolium, commonly known as the hornleaf psorospermum, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are often adorned with waxy, glandular dots. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by dark blue to black berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
