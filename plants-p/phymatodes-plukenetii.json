It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in limestone soils. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers."
