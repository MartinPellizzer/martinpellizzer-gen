    "intro": "Primula minuta, commonly known as the dwarf primrose, is a small herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, featuring delicate, spurred flowers in shades of yellow, white, and pink. The plant has basal leaves that are oval-shaped with hairy surfaces, and its flowering period occurs in spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or shaded areas. Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements."
