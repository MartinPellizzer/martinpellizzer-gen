    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. argentea, commonly known as the silver spruce, is a horticultural form of the white spruce. It is characterized by its striking silvery-blue foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance in gardens and landscapes. The leaves are typically shorter and more densely packed compared to the typical white spruce, enhancing its ornamental value. This variety thrives in cooler climates and well-drained soils, making it suitable for northern regions. It is often used as a specimen tree or in formal gardens due to its elegant, compact growth habit."
