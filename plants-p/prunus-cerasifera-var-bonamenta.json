    "intro": "Prunus cerasifera var. bonamenta, commonly known as the cherry laurel or Prunus laurocerasus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its dense foliage and seasonal interest. However, it is toxic to humans and animals, so care should be taken when handling or planting it."
