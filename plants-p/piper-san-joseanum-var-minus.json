    "intro": "Piper san-joseanum var. minus, commonly known as the dwarf sanderling pepper, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Piper genus. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and its unique, aromatic leaves that emit a distinct peppery scent. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, appearing in clusters, while the fruits are small, round berries that mature to a dark purple color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
