    "intro": "Phaseolus asperrimus, commonly known as the rough-phaseolus, is a species of legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, bristly stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated, bean-like pods. The seeds are typically small and can vary in color depending on the variety. It is often grown as a forage crop or for its edible seeds, though it is less commonly cultivated than other Phaseolus species."
