It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
