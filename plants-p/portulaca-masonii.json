    "intro": "Portulaca masonii, commonly known as the Mason's portulaca, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual plant with fleshy, succulent leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in hot, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its thick, waxy leaves. Its flowers typically bloom in the morning and close by midday, a trait known as nyctinasty. Portulaca masonii is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a hardy, resilient species in xerophytic habitats."
