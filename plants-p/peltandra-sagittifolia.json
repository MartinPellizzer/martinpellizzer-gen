It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Peltandra sagittifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
