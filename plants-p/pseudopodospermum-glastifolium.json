    "intro": "Pseudopodospermum glastifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pseudopodospermum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species, and is characterized by its succulent leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
