It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves and small, clustered white flowers that develop into dark purple berries.

Its leaves are rich in essential oils, contributing to its use in traditional medicine. The varietal name \"radicescens\" refers to its root-like stems that help it anchor and spread effectively."
