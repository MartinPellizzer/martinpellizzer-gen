    "intro": "Pescatoria aprilensis, commonly known as the April shoreline fern, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along tidal zones and is adapted to withstand periodic salt spray and flooding. The plant produces small, delicate white flowers in early spring, followed by feathery, greenish-brown seed plumes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming dense clusters near the ground. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
