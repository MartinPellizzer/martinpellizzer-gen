    "intro": "Pedicularis sibirica subsp. uralensis, commonly known as the Ural lousewort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and clusters of striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine and subarctic environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
