    "intro": "Pulicaria nobilis, commonly known as noble cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, mat-forming habit, featuring silver-gray foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. Pulicaria nobilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and attractive appearance."
