    "intro": "Pithecellobium obliquifoliolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mountain bean, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves with elongated, narrow leaflets and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a pod containing several edible, bean-like seeds that are often used in local cuisines. The plant also has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion in its natural habitat."
