It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for gardeners in arid regions."
