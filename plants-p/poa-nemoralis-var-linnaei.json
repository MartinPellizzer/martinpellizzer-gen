    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. linnaei, commonly known as the Linnaean bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which produces small, two-lobed spikelets with pale yellow to greenish flowers. This variety is notable for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
