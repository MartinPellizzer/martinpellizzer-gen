    "intro": "Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia var. kelseyana, commonly known as the Kelsey's London plane, is a hybrid tree resulting from the cross between Platanus occidentalis and Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that resemble those of maple trees, though they are broader and more lobed. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that split open to release tufts of cottony seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It is typically found in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compact root system. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
