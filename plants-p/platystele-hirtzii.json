    "intro": "Platystele hirtzii, commonly known as the hairy flat-leaved orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant features a short, underground rhizome and produces delicate, hairy leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale green, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Platystele hirtzii is considered a rare and endangered species."
