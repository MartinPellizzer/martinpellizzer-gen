    "intro": "Paphiopedilum mastersianum var. mastersianum, commonly known as the Masters' lady's slipper, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a fleshy, often hairy rhizome and produces showy, slipper-shaped flowers. The petals and sepals are typically greenish-yellow with distinctive red or orange markings, while the lip is usually a deep red or orange. It thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-draining soil, and is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture. This species is also notable for its relatively compact size and ease of cultivation."
