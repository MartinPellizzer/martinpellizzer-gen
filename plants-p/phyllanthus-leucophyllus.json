    "intro": "Phyllanthus leucophyllus, commonly known as the white-leaf phyllanthus, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, compact foliage with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, spherical berries that are initially green and turn red as they mature. Its leaves are characterized by their smooth, waxy surface and prominent veins, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks."
