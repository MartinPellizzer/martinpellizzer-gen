    "intro": "Phalaris vivipara, commonly known as the common marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and flooded meadows. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue. Phalaris vivipara is known for its ability to thrive in saturated soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
