    "intro": "Poa annua subsp. remotiflora, commonly known as the slender annual bluegrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is both a common weed and a valuable forage species."
