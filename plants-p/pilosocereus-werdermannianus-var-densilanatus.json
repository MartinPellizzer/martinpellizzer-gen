It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that are typically cylindrical in shape. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and cactus collections."
