    "intro": "Phoebe sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran phoebe, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and smooth, dark bark. The plant typically grows in lowland and hill forest areas, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in catkins. Phoebe sumatrana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited commercial use due to its slow growth and rarity in cultivation."
