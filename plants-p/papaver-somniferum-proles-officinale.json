    "intro": "Papaver somniferum proles officinale, commonly known as opium poppy, is a flowering plant native to the region of the Caucasus and southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and capsule-like seed pods that contain latex-rich cells. The plant's botanical features include alternate, palmately lobed leaves and a taproot system. The latex produced in the seed pods contains alkaloids such as morphine and codeine, which have medicinal and illicit uses. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is heavily regulated in many countries."
