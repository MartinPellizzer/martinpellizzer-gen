It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped fruits that resemble small, yellow-orange berries. The plant produces small, opposite leaves with a velvety texture and emits a strong, aromatic scent. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The fruit is edible when ripe, though it is often used in local culinary traditions and traditional medicine."
