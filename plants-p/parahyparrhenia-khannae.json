    "intro": "Parahyparrhenia khannae, commonly known as the khanna grass, is a perennial grass species native to the tropical and subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common component of wetland and riparian ecosystems. Parahyparrhenia khannae is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
