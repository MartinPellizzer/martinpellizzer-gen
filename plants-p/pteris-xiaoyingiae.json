    "intro": "Pteris xiaoyingiae, commonly known as the Xiaoying fern, is a species of water fern native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually bright green and often have a wavy or undulating margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Pteridaceae family. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
