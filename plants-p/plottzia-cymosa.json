    "intro": "Plottzia cymosa, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Plottsiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, blue or purple flower heads that resemble holly berries. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, particularly in sandy or rocky soils, and thrives in saline environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Plottzia cymosa is often found in the intertidal zone, where it tolerates periodic submersion and salt spray."
