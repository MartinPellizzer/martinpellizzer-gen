    "intro": "Podaechmea tuitensis, commonly known as the Tuitu Islands cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the Tuitu Islands in the Solomon Islands. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. It thrives in humid, tropical conditions and is adapted to grow in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Podaechmea tuitensis is considered a vulnerable species."
