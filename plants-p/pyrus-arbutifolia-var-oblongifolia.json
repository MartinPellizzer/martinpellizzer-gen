    "intro": "Pyrus arbutifolia var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It features alternate, oblong to lanceolate leaves that are typically 3\u20138 inches long and have a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits to wildlife."
