It features a globular or cylindrical stem that is typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its slow growth and drought tolerance. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
