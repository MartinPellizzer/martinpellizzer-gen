It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by cactus enthusiasts."
