    "intro": "Pleurothallis triangulilabia, commonly known as the triangular-lipped pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowering structures. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its compact appearance. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
