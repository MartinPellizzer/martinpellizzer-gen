    "intro": "Poteridium annuum, commonly known as annual saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to harsh, saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes. Poteridium annuum is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ecological benefits."
