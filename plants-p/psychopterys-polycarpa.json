    "intro": "Psychopterys polycarpa, commonly known as the Mexican feather grass, is a perennial grass native to Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, arching leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ability to form dense clumps makes it effective for erosion control in dry, rocky areas."
