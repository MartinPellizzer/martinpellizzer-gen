    "intro": "Perrierangraecum oblongifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved perrierang, is a rare and endangered species native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
