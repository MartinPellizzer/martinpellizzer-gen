    "intro": "Pitcairnia biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered pitcairnia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. The inflorescence consists of two showy, violet-blue flowers that open sequentially, which is a distinctive feature of the species. Pitcairnia biflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a greenhouse or indoor environment."
