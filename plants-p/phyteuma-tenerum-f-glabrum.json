    "intro": "Phyteuma tenerum f. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth phyteuma, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features upright stems with lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically shorter than those of the species. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pale yellow to orange-red flowers in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its foliage is often more densely packed and less hairy than the typical form, giving it a distinct appearance."
