    "intro": "Phoebe fruticosa, commonly known as the coastal phoebe, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by blue-black berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy or disturbed soils. Phoebe fruticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in coastal ecosystems."
