    "intro": "Pennisetum maiwa, commonly known as purple fountain grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery plumes that produce a striking purple or pink coloration. The plant typically grows between 1 to 3 meters in height and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the inflorescence consists of dense, tufted spikes that give it a fountain-like appearance. Pennisetum maiwa is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and drought tolerance."
