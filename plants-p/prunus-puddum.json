    "intro": "Prunus puddum, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or the alpine cherry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and features small, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are dark red to black in color. Prunus puddum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and ornamental horticulture."
