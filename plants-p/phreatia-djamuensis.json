    "intro": "Phreatia djamuensis, commonly known as the Djamuensian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or in rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
