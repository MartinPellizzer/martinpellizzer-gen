    "intro": "Plantago brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-leaved plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features rosettes of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
