    "intro": "Polygonum arenastrum var. caspicum, commonly known as the Caspian knotweed, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, adapting to the harsh, dry environments it inhabits. This species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along riverbanks and in desert margins."
