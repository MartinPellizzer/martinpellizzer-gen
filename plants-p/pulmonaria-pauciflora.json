It features basal rosettes of velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with red or purple markings. The plant produces upright flowering stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink or violet. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. Pulmonaria pauciflora is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
