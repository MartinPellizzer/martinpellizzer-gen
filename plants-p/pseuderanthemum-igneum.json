It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored leaves that range from red to orange, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas within forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
