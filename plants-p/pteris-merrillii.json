    "intro": "Pteris merrillii, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive pattern of pinnae and pinnules. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. Pteris merrillii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
