    "intro": "Palaua prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate palaua, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Palaua prostrata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
