    "intro": "Perityle ciliata, commonly known as the hairy perityle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Perityle ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
