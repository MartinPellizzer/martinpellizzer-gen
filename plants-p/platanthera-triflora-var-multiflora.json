    "intro": "Platanthera triflora var. multiflora, commonly known as the multiflora lady's slipper, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant grows in moist, acidic habitats such as woodlands and bogs, often in partial shade. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces a single stem with several flowers clustered at the top. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
