    "intro": "Plectocephalus illapelinus, commonly known as the Illapelinus cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves that are dark green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water once established. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
