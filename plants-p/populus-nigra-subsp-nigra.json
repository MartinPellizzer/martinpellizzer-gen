    "intro": "Populus nigra subsp. nigra, commonly known as the black poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length. The tree produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist soils near rivers and streams, making it a common riparian species. The black poplar is also valued for its historical use in timber and as a habitat for various wildlife species."
