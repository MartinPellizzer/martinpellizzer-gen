    "intro": "Prunus nairica, commonly known as the Nairi cherry, is a small deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and features simple, ovate leaves with a smooth margin. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by edible drupes that are yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and horticultural collections."
