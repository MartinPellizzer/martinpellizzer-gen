    "intro": "Pallenis spinosa subsp. aurea, commonly known as the golden spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small yellow flowers, typically in clusters, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant yellow blooms and adaptive features for survival in harsh environments."
