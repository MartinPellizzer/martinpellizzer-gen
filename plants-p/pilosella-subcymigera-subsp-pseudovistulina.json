    "intro": "Pilosella subcymigera subsp. pseudovistulina, commonly known as the false Vistula hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, mat-forming growth. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish to white flowers arranged in compact clusters. It is native to Central and Eastern Europe and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
