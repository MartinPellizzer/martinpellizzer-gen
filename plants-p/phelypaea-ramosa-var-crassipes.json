    "intro": "Phelypaea ramosa var. crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved water clover, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, floating foliage composed of small, heart-shaped leaves that form a mat on the water surface. The plant has thin, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving waters. It is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands where it provides habitat for aquatic organisms. Its botanical features make it both an ornamental and ecological plant in aquatic environments."
