    "intro": "Pyrus melanocarpa var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-leafed black crabapple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and striking purple-tinged leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible, tart apples that are often used in culinary applications. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in temperate climates."
