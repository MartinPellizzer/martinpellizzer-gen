    "intro": "Primula filchnerae, commonly known as the Filchner's primrose, is a rare alpine plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant typically blooms in the spring and is adapted to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. It has hairy leaves and a short stem, which help it withstand harsh weather conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
