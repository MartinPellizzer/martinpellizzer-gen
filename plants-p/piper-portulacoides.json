It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper plants, and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that develop into small, berry-like fruits. Its botanical structure is adapted to thrive in high-altitude, rocky environments, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
