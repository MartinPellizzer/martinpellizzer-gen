    "intro": "Polypodium stegnogrammoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, linear leaves that are often divided into small, finger-like segments. Its fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 50 centimeters. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
