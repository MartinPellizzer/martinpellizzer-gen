    "intro": "Pontaletsje, commonly known as the \"lesser marsh orchid,\" is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Pontaletsje plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
