    "intro": "Panax atropurpureus, commonly known as the purple ginseng, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Korea. It is a perennial herb characterized by its distinctive purple stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters and is known for its unique root system, which is highly valued in traditional medicine. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is critically endangered and protected in many regions. Its botanical features make it a subject of both scientific study and conservation efforts."
