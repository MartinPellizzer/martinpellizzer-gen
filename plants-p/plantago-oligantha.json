    "intro": "Plantago oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright, branched stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a rough, sandpaper-like texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves and seeds have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and wound-healing benefits. Plantago oligantha is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in harsh environments."
