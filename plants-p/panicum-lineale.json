    "intro": "Panicum lineale, commonly known as the narrowleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
