    "intro": "Peranema paleolatum, commonly known as the ancient water fern, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in marshes and ponds. Its reproductive structures include tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by water currents. Peranema paleolatum plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
