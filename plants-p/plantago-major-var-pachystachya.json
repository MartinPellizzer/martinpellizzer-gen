    "intro": "Plantago major var. pachystachya, commonly known as the broadleaf plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a rosette of broad, oval-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and prominent veins, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, roadsides, and fields. This variety is notable for its medicinal uses and ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions."
