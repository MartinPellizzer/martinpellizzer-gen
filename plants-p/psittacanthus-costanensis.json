It is native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica, and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with colorful bracts that resemble a pineapple, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Psittacanthus costanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
