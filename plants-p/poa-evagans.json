    "intro": "Poa evagans, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to various parts of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage and fine, soft blades that often form a mat-like growth pattern. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Poa evagans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in turfgrass mixes for its durability and ability to recover from wear. Its reproductive structures, including small, spike-like inflorescences, contribute to its ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
