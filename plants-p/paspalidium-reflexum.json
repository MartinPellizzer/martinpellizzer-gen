    "intro": "Paspalidium reflexum, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along waterways. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
