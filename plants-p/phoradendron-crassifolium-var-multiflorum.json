    "intro": "Phoradendron crassifolium var. multiflorum, commonly known as the Florida mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the southeastern United States. It has small, leathery, evergreen leaves that are typically clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers, followed by small, fleshy, orange berries that are a food source for birds. It relies on its host for water and some nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis. Its ecological role includes providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
