    "intro": "Phaeopappus daralagoezicus, commonly known as the Daralagoezic phaeopappus, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its distinctive dark purple to black bracts that give it its scientific name, \"phaeopappus,\" meaning \"dark pappus.\" The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the short growing season in its alpine habitat. Its leaves are narrow and densely packed, adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
