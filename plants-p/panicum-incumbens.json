    "intro": "Panicum incumbens, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces fluffy, reddish-brown seed heads that are prominent in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that contrasts with the reddish inflorescences. Panicum incumbens plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
