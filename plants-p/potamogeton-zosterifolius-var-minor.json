It has long, thin, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 mm wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, which are often submerged or just at the water surface. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates. This variety is often found in slow-moving or still waters with muddy or sandy bottoms."
