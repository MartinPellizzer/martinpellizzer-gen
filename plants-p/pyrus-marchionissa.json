    "intro": "Pyrus marchionissa, commonly known as the Marchioness pear, is a small, deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit and smooth, grayish-brown bark. The tree produces small, clustered white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart pears that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and culinary qualities."
