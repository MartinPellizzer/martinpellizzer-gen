It is a perennial herb characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, along roadsides, and in wetlands. This variant is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
