    "intro": "Penstemon bicolor, commonly known as the blue mist penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces tall, slender stems that support its vibrant flower clusters. Penstemon bicolor is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
