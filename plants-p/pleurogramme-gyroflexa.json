It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is native to freshwater environments in Southeast Asia. The plant's intricate, ribbon-like leaves form a helical structure that aids in maximizing light absorption. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters with soft substrates. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
