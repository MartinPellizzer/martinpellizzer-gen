    "intro": "Polypodium hartii, commonly known as the Hart's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Polypodium hartii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
