    "intro": "Paspalum pertenue, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to South America. It has slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control."
