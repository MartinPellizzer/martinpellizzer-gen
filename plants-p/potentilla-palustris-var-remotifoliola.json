It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has thin, wiry stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is adapted to moist, acidic soils and plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
