    "intro": "Prunus pilosiuscula var. media, commonly known as the dwarf Japanese cherry, is a compact shrub or small tree native to Japan. It features delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a fine, silvery down on the upper surface. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value lies in its early blooming habit and graceful form."
