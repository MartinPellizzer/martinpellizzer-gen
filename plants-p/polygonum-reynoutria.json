    "intro": "Polygonum reynoutria, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its bamboo-like stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is known for its aggressive growth and invasive nature in non-native regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and capable of regenerating new shoots from even small fragments."
