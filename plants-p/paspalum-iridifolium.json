    "intro": "Paspalum iridifolium, commonly known as the blue false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces small, blue-green spikelets that are often mistaken for bromegrass. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its foliage is narrow and bluish-green, contributing to its ornamental appeal in certain landscapes. Paspalum iridifolium is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
