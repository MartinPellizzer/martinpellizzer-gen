    "intro": "Poa distans, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that bears small, two-lobed spikelets. Poa distans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
