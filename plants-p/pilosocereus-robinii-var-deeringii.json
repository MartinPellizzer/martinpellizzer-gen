    "intro": "Pilosocereus robinii var. deeringii, commonly known as the Deering's night blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a flowering cactus characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and the ability to produce large, showy white flowers at night. The plant has a thick, succulent stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are typically fragrant and open only during the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
