    "intro": "Pericopsis angolensis f. intermedia, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The tree produces long, woody pods that contain flat, brown seeds. It is valued for its dense, aromatic timber, which is highly sought after in the furniture and musical instrument industries. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also classified as a vulnerable species."
