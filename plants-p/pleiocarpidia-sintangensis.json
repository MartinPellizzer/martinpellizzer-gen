It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its unique morphological features, including its compound leaves and showy flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern. Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of biodiversity in understudied tropical regions."
