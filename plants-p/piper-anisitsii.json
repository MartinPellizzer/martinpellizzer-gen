    "intro": "Piper anisitsii, commonly known as the sacred pepper of the Andes, is a climbing shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species, and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves and fruits contain various bioactive compounds, making it of interest in both traditional medicine and scientific research. Due to its habitat in remote, high-altitude areas, it is relatively rare and endangered."
