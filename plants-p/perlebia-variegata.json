    "intro": "Perlebia variegata, commonly known as the variegated perlebia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its strikingly variegated leaves with bright yellow and green patterns. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically orange or yellow in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
