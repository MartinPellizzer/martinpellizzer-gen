    "intro": "Polyscias rainaliorum, commonly known as the rainforest glory bush, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It features dense, glossy green foliage with a broad, spreading habit that makes it suitable for ornamental planting. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but not typically for humans. It thrives in humid, shady environments with well-drained soil and requires consistent moisture. Due to its attractive appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
