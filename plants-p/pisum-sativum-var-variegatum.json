    "intro": "Pisum sativum var. variegatum, commonly known as the variegated pea, is a botanical variant of the common pea plant. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf patterns, which display a mix of green and white or yellow hues due to the presence of variegation in its chloroplasts. This variegation is often a result of genetic mutations affecting chlorophyll production. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, similar to other pea varieties. It is primarily cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance, though it can also be grown for minor culinary use."
