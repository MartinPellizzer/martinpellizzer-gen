    "intro": "Potentilla supina f. limosa, commonly known as the creeping potentilla or swamp cinquefoil, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its prostrate habit and dense, mat-forming growth. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The leaves are generally rounded, with a waxy surface and a slight pubescence, adapting to moist, acidic soils. This variety is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams, thriving in environments with high humidity. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet areas."
