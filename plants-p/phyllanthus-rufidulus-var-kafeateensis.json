    "intro": "Phyllanthus rufidulus var. kafeateensis, commonly known as the Kafateensis phyllanthus, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by round, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant."
