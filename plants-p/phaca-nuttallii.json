    "intro": "Phaca nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's phaca, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. Its small yellow flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Phaca nuttallii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
