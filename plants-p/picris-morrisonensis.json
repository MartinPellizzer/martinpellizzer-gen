    "intro": "Picris morrisonensis, commonly known as Morrison's goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-water environments. Its yellow flowers appear in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
