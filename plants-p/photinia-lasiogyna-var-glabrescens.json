    "intro": "Photinia lasiogyna var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf photinia, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically smooth and glossy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it suitable for hedges or specimen planting."
