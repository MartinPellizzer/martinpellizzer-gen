    "intro": "Phoradendron tomentosum var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the wooly podocarp, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. It has small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly layer of white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its root system forms haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients and water. The species is notable for its unique symbiotic relationship with its host and its role in the ecological dynamics of forest ecosystems."
