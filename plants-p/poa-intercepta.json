    "intro": "Poa intercepta, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and is often found in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has a tufted growth habit with dense, short blades that are typically less than 10 cm in length. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Poa intercepta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine flora and fauna."
