    "intro": "Pedicularis praealta, commonly known as the tall monkey orchid, is a striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, spurred flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on host plants for nutrients through its roots. Its flowers, which can grow up to 10 centimeters in length, are typically pink or red with a distinctive hooded shape. Pedicularis praealta thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
