    "intro": "Potentilla anserina var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features dense, silver-white foliage covered with fine, hairy glands, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, harsh environments."
