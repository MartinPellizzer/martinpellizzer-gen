    "intro": "Pholidota recurva, commonly known as the silverleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its root system is shallow and fibrous, adapting to various soil types. The silverleaf maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in woodland habitats."
