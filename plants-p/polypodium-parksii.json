    "intro": "Polypodium parksii, commonly known as the Park's fern, is a species of polypodiaceae found in tropical regions. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of moss-like structures, which help retain moisture. Polypodium parksii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
