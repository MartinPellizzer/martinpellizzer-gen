It features lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
