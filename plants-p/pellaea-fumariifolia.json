    "intro": "Pellaea fumariifolia, commonly known as the flame fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its striking, bright red to orange spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its fronds. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often described as resembling flames, giving it its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Pellaea fumariifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal coloration."
