    "intro": "Potentilla affinis, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.

The plant has compound leaves with five to nine leaflets, which are usually hairy and grayish-green in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Potentilla affinis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
