    "intro": "Potentilla anserina f. appressa, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in landscaping."
