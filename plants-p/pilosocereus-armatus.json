    "intro": "Pilosocereus armatus, commonly known as the armed cactus or the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny stems and dense clusters of spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. Pilosocereus armatus is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its resilience and unique appearance."
