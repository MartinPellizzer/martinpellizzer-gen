    "intro": "Podanthum limonifolium var. ramosum, commonly known as the lemon-leaf podanthum, is a unique member of the Podanthum genus native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its bright yellow, lemon-like leaves that are both ornamental and aromatic. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by capsule fruits containing tiny seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
