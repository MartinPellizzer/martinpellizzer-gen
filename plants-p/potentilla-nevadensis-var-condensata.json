    "intro": "Potentilla nevadensis var. condensata, commonly known as the Sierra plum sock. This plant is a flowering shrub native to the western United States, particularly in high-elevation areas of California and Nevada. It features dense, compact growth with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
