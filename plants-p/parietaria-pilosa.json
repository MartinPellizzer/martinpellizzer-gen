    "intro": "Parietaria pilosa, commonly known as the hairy wall pennywort, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along walls, in gardens, and in woodland areas. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are tiny and greenish-white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. Parietaria pilosa is known for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated settings."
