It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy leaves and adaptations to arid environments. The plant features a basal rosette of thick, waxy leaves that store water, and it produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is valued in both horticulture and ecological restoration projects."
