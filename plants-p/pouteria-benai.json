    "intro": "Pouteria benai, commonly known as the red mangosteen, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, segmented fruits with a bright red outer husk. The fruit's interior contains a white, juicy aril that is rich in nutrients and has a sweet, aromatic flavor. Pouteria benai is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in its native habitat."
