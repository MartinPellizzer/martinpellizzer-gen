    "intro": "Pecteilis rawatii, commonly known as the Himalayan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or gravelly soils, and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Pecteilis rawatii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions."
