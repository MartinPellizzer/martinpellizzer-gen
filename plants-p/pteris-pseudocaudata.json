    "intro": "Pteris pseudocaudata, commonly known as the false chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky layer of trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds. Pteris pseudocaudata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
