It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
