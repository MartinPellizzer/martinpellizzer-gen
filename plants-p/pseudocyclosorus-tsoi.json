    "intro": "Pseudocyclosorus tsoi, commonly known as the Tsoi's false water fern, is a rare and specialized aquatic plant belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four parts, resembling a four-leaf clover. This plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health."
