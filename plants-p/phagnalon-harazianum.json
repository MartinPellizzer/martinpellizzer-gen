    "intro": "Phagnalon harazianum, commonly known as the Harazian silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. Phagnalon harazianum is adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, thriving in high-altitude habitats with limited moisture."
