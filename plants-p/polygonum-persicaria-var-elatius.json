The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, streambanks, and marshy areas. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
