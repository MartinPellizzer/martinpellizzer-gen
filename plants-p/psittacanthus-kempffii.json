    "intro": "Psittacanthus kempffii, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow to orange spore-bearing structures that resemble small stars, which are clustered at the tips of its fronds. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically dark green with a waxy texture, and they can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Psittacanthus kempffii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to add visual interest to indoor or outdoor gardens."
