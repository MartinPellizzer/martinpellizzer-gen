    "intro": "Psittacanthus macrantherus, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered fronds that form a dense, upright rosette. The plant features bright yellow to orange spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest undergrowth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
