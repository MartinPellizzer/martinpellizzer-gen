It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its unique floral structure and ecological importance, it is a valuable plant for pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
