    "intro": "Poagrostis pusilla, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 inches in length, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is a perennial species with rhizomes that help it spread and establish in various habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems and a useful plant for erosion control."
