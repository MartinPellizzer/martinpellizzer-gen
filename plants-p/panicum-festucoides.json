    "intro": "Panicum festucoides, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender flowering stalks that bear small, spike-like clusters of bracts. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
