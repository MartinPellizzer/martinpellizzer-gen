    "intro": "Psilotrichum gramineum, commonly known as the common spike moss, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Psilotaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often mistaken for moss. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests or along stream banks. Psilotrichum gramineum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
