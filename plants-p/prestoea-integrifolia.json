    "intro": "Prestoea integrifolia, commonly known as the white cedar, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale gray bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are entire and glossy. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red fruits containing winged seeds. It is often found growing in moist, well-drained soils near rivers and in coastal areas. Prestoea integrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
