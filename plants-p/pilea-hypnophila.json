    "intro": "Pilea hypnophila, commonly known as the \"Chinese money plant,\" is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant with a short, upright stem and rosettes of heart-shaped, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea hypnophila is popular as a houseplant due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
