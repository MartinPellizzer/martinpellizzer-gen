    "intro": "Phaca littoralis, commonly known as the salt marsh cordgrass, is a halophytic perennial grass native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in estuaries and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Phaca littoralis plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species."
