It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom on tall, erect stems. The plant is often found in wetland or marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine, silky hair, while its roots are fibrous and extensively branched. Pfaffia eriocephala is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
