    "intro": "Phytelephas longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered sacha inchi, is a member of the Malvaceae family native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a tall, evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, elongated pods containing edible seeds. These seeds, known as sacha inchi, are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and are valued for their nutritional properties. Due to its ecological and economic significance, Phytelephas longiflora plays an important role in both local ecosystems and global health initiatives."
