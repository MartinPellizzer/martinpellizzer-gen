    "intro": "Polypodium grandidens, commonly known as the giant huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium grandidens is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
