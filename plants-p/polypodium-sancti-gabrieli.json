    "intro": "Polypodium sancti-gabrieli, commonly known as the Saint Gabriel huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, lanceolate shape. Native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves. It is often found in rocky or forested areas, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
