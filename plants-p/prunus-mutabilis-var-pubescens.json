It is characterized by its distinctive, variable flower color, which can range from white to pink to red, depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, edible fruits known as cherries, which are typically red or yellow when mature. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin and turn yellow in the fall. The pubescent variety is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, giving it a textured appearance."
