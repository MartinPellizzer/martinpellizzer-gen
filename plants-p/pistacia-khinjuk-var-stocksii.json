It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and is dioecious, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to yellow or red as it matures. The plant is valued for its edible fruit and has been cultivated for centuries in regions with warm climates."
