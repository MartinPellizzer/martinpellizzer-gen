It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant produces fine, hair-like structures called phytanthus, which contain natural insecticides known as pyrethrins. These compounds are widely used in organic pest control due to their effectiveness against a variety of insects. Pyrethrum szowitsii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in harsh environments."
