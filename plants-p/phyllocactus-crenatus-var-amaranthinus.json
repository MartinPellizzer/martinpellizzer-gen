    "intro": "Phyllocactus crenatus var. amaranthinus, commonly known as the coral pine, is a unique cacti species native to South America. It features a distinctive appearance with its branching stems that resemble coral-like structures. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem covered in small, rounded tubercles. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, and it produces small, yellow flowers during the growing season. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
