    "intro": "Physalis obscura var. viscidopubescens, commonly known as the sticky-hairy husk tomato, is a variant of the husk tomato species native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, somewhat sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange fruits enclosed in a papery, inflated calyx. These fruits are typically harvested when they turn a deep red or orange hue. It thrives in warm, dry climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits and ornamental value."
