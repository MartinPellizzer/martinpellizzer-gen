    "intro": "Puschkinia kurdistanica, commonly known as the Kurdish scilla, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and Iran, where it thrives in rocky and woodland habitats. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves emerge. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its bulbs are adapted for storage and propagation. Puschkinia kurdistanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
