    "intro": "Panicum rohrii, commonly known as Rohri's panicgrass, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open habitats such as fields and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
