    "intro": "Pleione suaveolens, commonly known as the fragrant pleione, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in spring, featuring pale yellow to white petals with a subtle fragrance. The plant grows as a terrestrial orchid, often found in shaded, humid environments at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, forming a rosette that helps it conserve moisture. The orchid's structure and blooming habits make it a popular subject for botanical study and horticultural cultivation."
