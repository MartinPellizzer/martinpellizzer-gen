It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces spikes of tubular, pink to purple flowers. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its nectar-rich flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological biodiversity."
