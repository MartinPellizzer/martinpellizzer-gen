    "intro": "Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia var. hispanica, commonly known as the Hispaniolan sycamore, is a hybrid species native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Platanaceae family and is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that resemble those of maple trees. The plant typically grows as a tall, deciduous tree with a rough, fissured bark that peels in thin, papery layers. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, while its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to coastal environments."
