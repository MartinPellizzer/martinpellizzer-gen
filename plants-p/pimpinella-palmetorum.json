It features a distinctive palmate leaf structure, with leaves divided into several lobes that radiate from a central point. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and can become invasive in certain environments. It is often found in moist, calcareous soils along riverbanks and woodland edges."
