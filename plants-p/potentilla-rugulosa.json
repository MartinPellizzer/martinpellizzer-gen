    "intro": "Potentilla rugulosa, commonly known as the rough cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely toothed, hairy leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Potentilla rugulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
