It is a fern with a distinctive, leathery, evergreen frond that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its fronds are deeply divided, with a unique appearance that resembles a shield, giving it its common name. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
