    "intro": "Pinguicula grandiflora subsp. longifolia, commonly known as the long-flowered butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Europe. It features small, sticky leaves that trap and digest insects, a key adaptation for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, adding ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity to flourish. Its subspecies distinction is based on floral morphology and leaf characteristics, distinguishing it from closely related species."
