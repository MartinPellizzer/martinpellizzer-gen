    "intro": "Polypodium nitidulum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
