    "intro": "Picea canadensis var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf white spruce, is a compact evergreen conifer native to Canada and the northern United States. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and dense, pyramidal shape, making it well-suited for small gardens or rockeries. The plant features needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly curved, with a fragrant scent when crushed. Its cones are small and typically hang downward, maturing to a reddish-brown color. This variety is particularly cold-hardy and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils."
