It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often on rocky slopes and meadows. The plant features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves, which give it its common name. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in a single head, surrounded by pale yellow ray florets. Pilosella lamprogaliciana is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
