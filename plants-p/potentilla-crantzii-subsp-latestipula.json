    "intro": "Potentilla crantzii subsp. latestipula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, five-lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions and has a low-growing habit to withstand strong winds. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies in arid and semi-arid ecosystems."
