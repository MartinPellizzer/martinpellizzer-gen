    "intro": "Puccinellia pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Puccinellia pringlei plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed environments and is of interest in ecological restoration efforts."
