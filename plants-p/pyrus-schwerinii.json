    "intro": "Pyrus schwerinii, commonly known as the Schwerin pear, is a deciduous tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that ripen in late summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and fruit production, it is often grown in gardens and orchards."
