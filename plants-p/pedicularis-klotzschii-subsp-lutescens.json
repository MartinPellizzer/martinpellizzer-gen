    "intro": "Pedicularis klotzschii subsp. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. It typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, often on rocky slopes or among grasslands. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it a notable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
