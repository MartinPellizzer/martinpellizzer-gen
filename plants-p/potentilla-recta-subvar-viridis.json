    "intro": "Potentilla recta subvar. viridis, commonly known as greenleaf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features upright, wiry stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are typically green, lance-shaped, and arranged in groups of five. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in rocky areas."
