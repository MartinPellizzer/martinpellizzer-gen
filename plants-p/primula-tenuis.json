    "intro": "Primula tenuis, commonly known as the slender primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are narrow and linear, often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
