    "intro": "Phymatodes, commonly known as the \"Texas star\" or \"desert star,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are characterized by their distinctive star-shaped flowers, which are typically pink or purple in color. Phymatodes species are perennial shrubs that often thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. They have deep root systems that allow them to survive in dry conditions. The leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss."
