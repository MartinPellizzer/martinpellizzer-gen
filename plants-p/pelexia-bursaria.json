    "intro": "Pelexia bursaria, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its unique bladder-like structures used for capturing small aquatic organisms. It is a member of the family Lentibulariaceae and is often found in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves that are typically submerged. Its most distinctive feature is the specialized bladders that function as trapping devices to capture prey, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. Pelexia bursaria is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the digestion of captured prey for survival."
