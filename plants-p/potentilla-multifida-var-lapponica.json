    "intro": "Potentilla multifida var. lapponica, commonly known as Lapland cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, feathery leaves that are adapted to cold climates and poor soil conditions. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for ecological restoration projects in harsh environments."
