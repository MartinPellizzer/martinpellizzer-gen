    "intro": "Parahebe derwentiana subsp. anisodonta, commonly known as the Southern Alps parahebe, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It features slender, upright stems that produce clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in native habitats."
