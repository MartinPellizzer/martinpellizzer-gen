    "intro": "Pandanus spiralis var. spiralis, commonly known as the spiral pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, spirally arranged leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often used in traditional crafts and is also valued for its ornamental qualities in landscaping."
