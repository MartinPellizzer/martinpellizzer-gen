    "intro": "Pachystela bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert's pachystela, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thick, fleshy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
