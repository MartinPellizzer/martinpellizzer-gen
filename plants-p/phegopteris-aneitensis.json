    "intro": "Phegopteris aneitensis, commonly known as the Aneityn fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in shaded, humid conditions. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are covered in small, rounded structures called sorus."
