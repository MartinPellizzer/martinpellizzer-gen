    "intro": "Plantago deppeana, commonly known as the desert plantain, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has a rosette of broad, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in a protective casing that aids in dispersal by animals or wind. This species is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water availability."
