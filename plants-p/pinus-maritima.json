    "intro": "Pinus maritima, commonly known as the maritime pine, is a coniferous tree native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula, France, and North Africa. It is characterized by its long, slender needles and tall, straight trunk, which can reach heights of up to 30 meters. The tree produces cones that are typically 10 to 15 centimeters long, containing winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its root system is adapted to withstand saline and well-drained soils, making it well-suited for coastal environments. The maritime pine plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various species."
