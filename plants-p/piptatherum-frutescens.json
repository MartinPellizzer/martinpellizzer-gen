    "intro": "Piptatherum frutescens, commonly known as the purple grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and its distinctive purple-tinged foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces wind-pollinated flowers, which are adapted to the arid environments it inhabits. Piptatherum frutescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
