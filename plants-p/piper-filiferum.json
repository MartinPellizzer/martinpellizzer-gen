    "intro": "Piper filiferum, commonly known as the creeping pepper vine, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by elliptical, edible berries that turn red when mature. The leaves are simple, ovate, and have a slightly rough texture, often used in traditional medicine."
