    "intro": "Parahebe jovellanoides, commonly known as the silver parahebe, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silvery-white to pale green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long blooming period."
