    "intro": "Phemeranthus humilis, commonly known as the ephemeral flower, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, short-lived flowers that open only briefly during the day. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowering period is often brief, which is why it is named \"ephemeral.\" The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique life cycle and ecological adaptations."
