    "intro": "Platanthera psycodes f. varians, commonly known as the variable twayblade, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, often growing in association with mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers are typically arranged in a spike and are pollinated by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
