It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is native to specific regions in tropical Asia. The plant exhibits a unique combination of morphological features, including small, clustered inflorescences and hairy stems. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
