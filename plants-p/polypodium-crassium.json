    "intro": "Polypodium crassium, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
