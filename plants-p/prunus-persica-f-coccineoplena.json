    "intro": "Prunus persica f. coccineoplena, commonly known as the Crimson Plume Peach, is a unique horticultural form of the peach tree characterized by its distinctive floral display. This variety is noted for its elongated, pinkish-red petals that create a striking visual effect, often resembling plumes or clouds. The flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, adding ornamental value to the tree. While it produces small, edible fruits, its primary appeal lies in its showy blossoms. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic beauty rather than for its fruit yield."
