It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research."
