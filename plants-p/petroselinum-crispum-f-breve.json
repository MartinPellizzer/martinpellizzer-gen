    "intro": "Petroselinum crispum f. breve, commonly known as curly parsley, is a compact variant of the parsley plant. It features finely divided, curly leaves that are smaller and more densely packed than those of the standard parsley. This form is often used as a garnish due to its aesthetic appeal and aromatic qualities. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool climates and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for both culinary and ornamental purposes."
