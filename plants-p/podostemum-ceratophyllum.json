    "intro": "Podostemum ceratophyllum, commonly known as the horned water-milfoil, is a unique aquatic plant found in fast-flowing streams and rivers. It is a member of the Podostemaceae family and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often submerged. The plant has specialized roots that anchor it to rocks and provide stability in turbulent waters. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Podostemum ceratophyllum plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic invertebrates and contributing to the overall biodiversity of freshwater ecosystems."
