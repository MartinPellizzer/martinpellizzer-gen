It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The tree is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often found in moist, lowland forests. Parinari metallica is valued for its hard wood and is sometimes used in local construction and fuel."
