    "intro": "Polygonum hornemannii, commonly known as the hornemann's knotweed, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its erect, often branched stems and heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils."
