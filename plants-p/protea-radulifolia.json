    "intro": "Protea radulifolia, commonly known as the coastal protea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, large, and often brightly colored inflorescences that resemble a cluster of individual flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, providing resistance to wind and salt spray. Protea radulifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting various pollinators."
