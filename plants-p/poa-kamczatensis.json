    "intro": "Poa kamczatensis, commonly known as Kamchatka bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and tufted growth habit, typically forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic regions. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Poa kamczatensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying cold-adapted flora."
