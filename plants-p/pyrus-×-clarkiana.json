    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 clarkiana, commonly known as the Clark's pear, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Pyrus communis (European pear) and Pyrus pyrifolia (Asian pear). It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, featuring a broad, rounded canopy and attractive, lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by sweet, aromatic fruit resembling a pear in shape. The fruit is usually harvested in late summer and is valued for its crisp texture and mild flavor, making it suitable for both fresh consumption and culinary use."
