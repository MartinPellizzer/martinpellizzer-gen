    "intro": "Phyteuma pyrenaicum var. brevibracteatum, commonly known as the short-bracted phyteuma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, bract-like structures at the base of its flowers. This variety is distinguished by its shorter bracts compared to the typical form of Phyteuma pyrenaicum."
