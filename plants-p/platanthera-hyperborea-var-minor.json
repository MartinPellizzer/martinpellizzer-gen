    "intro": "Platanthera hyperborea var. minor, commonly known as the lesser ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its pale green to white flowers, which are often described as resembling ghostly apparitions due to their translucent appearance. This orchid thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in bogs or along the edges of ponds. It has a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
