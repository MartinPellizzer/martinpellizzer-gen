    "intro": "Poa pratensis var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic bluegrass, is a variant of the common bluegrass species native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which makes it well-suited for sandy or well-drained soils. This variety is often found in dune environments and coastal grasslands, where it contributes to soil stabilization and ecological diversity. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form extensive colonies, enhancing its resilience to environmental stressors. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its aesthetic qualities."
