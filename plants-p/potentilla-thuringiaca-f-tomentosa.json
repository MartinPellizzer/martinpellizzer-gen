    "intro": "Potentilla thuringiaca f. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant is distinguished by its hairy, silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Native to central and eastern Europe, it thrives in dry, rocky soils and full sun conditions. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
