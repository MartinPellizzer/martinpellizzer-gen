    "intro": "Primula epilosa, commonly known as the cushion primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with numerous small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are borne on short pedicels and are often clustered at the tips of the stems, creating a striking visual display in its natural habitat."
