    "intro": "Papaver somniferum var. rubellum, commonly known as the red poppy, is a variant of the opium poppy characterized by its striking red petals and a shorter stem compared to the standard opium poppy. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds used in both ornamental and agricultural contexts. Its flowers bloom in early summer, adding vibrant color to gardens and landscapes. Due to its botanical relation to the opium poppy, it is subject to legal restrictions in many regions."
