    "intro": "Perrottetia guacharana, commonly known as the Guacharana flower, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its ornamental, showy blooms. The plant typically features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its aesthetic appeal in horticulture. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
