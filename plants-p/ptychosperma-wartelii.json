It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue to black berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
