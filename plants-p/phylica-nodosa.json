    "intro": "Phylica nodosa, commonly known as the knobbly bush, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, waxy leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in rounded clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiky seed pods. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Phylica nodosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
