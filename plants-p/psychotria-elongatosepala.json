    "intro": "Psychotria elongatosepala, commonly known as the elongated sepal Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its elongated sepals, which are often brightly colored, and its small, clustered flowers. It produces small, dark berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Psychotria elongatosepala is also noted for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
