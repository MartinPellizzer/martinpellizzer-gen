    "intro": "Prasophyllum intricatum, commonly known as the intricate leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the southern regions of Australia. It typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils, often in heathland or woodland habitats. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and bears a single, slender flower spike with small, pale green to white flowers. It is a perennial species that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is common among orchids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and land clearing."
