    "intro": "Polystichum decoratum subsp. decoratum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered with a silvery or whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically clustered on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
