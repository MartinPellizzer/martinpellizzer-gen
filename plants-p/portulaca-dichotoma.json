It features fleshy, ribbed stems that often branch into two, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its leaves are thick and succulent, adapted to store water and survive in dry conditions. Portulaca dichotoma is often found in sandy soils and can thrive in disturbed environments."
