    "intro": "Podocarpus gnidioides var. caespitosus, commonly known as the clustered podocarp, is a shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a landscaping plant."
