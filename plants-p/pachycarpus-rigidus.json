    "intro": "Pachycarpus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid thistle, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright, woody stems and spiny leaves, which are adaptations to its arid environment. The plant produces small, purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its thick, fleshy leaves store water, aiding in survival during dry periods. Pachycarpus rigidus is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
