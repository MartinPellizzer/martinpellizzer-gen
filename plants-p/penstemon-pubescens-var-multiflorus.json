    "intro": "Penstemon pubescens var. multiflorus, commonly known as the hairy beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is well adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and meadows."
