    "intro": "Pilosella coacta, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, yellowish-green flower heads. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. The plant's leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. It blooms from late spring to early autumn, producing small composite flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
