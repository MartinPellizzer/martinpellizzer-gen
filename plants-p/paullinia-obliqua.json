    "intro": "Paullinia obliqua, commonly known as the Amazonian miracle berry, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of a unique compound called miraculin, which alters taste perception. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests."
