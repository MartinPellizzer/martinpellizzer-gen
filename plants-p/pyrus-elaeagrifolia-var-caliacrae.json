    "intro": "Pyrus elaeagrifolia var. caliacrae, commonly known as the Cilicia pear, is a rare and ornamental species native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, yellowish fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers a sunny to partially shaded location. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
