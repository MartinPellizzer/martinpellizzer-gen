    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 potteri, commonly known as the Potter's shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Polystichum acutifolium and Polystichum munitum. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteridaceae family. Polystichum \u00d7 potteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
