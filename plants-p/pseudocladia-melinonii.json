It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
