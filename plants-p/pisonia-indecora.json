    "intro": "Pisonia indecora, commonly known as the Hawaiian hibiscus or the pink hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Ocean, including Hawaii, the Mariana Islands, and parts of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, featuring woody stems and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white, often with a distinctive yellow or red throat. These flowers are typically borne in clusters and are pollinated by birds and insects. Pisonia indecora is also known for its fibrous bark, which has been used traditionally for making ropes and textiles."
