    "intro": "Polygonatum vulgare var. macranthum, commonly known as the giant Solomon's seal, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features long, arching stems that bear clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers followed by red berries. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil. This variety is notable for its larger, more showy flowers compared to the typical Solomon's seal."
