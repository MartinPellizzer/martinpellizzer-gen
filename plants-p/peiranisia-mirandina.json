    "intro": "Peiranisia mirandina, commonly known as the Mirandine orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant blooms that range from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is now classified as an endangered species."
