    "intro": "Polygonum rupestre, commonly known as rocksmartweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as cliffs, slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant features upright stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers. It is part of the Polygonaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like buckwheat and sorrel. Polygonum rupestre is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
