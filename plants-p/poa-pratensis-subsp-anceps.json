It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant typically forms a sod-like turf, making it suitable for lawns and sports fields. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers."
