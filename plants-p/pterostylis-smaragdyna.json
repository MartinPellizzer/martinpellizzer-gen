    "intro": "Pterostylis smaragdyna, commonly known as the emerald green orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, striking greenish-yellow flower. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, primarily thrips, which are attracted to the nectar-rich labellum. The orchid's unique coloration and morphology make it a notable species within the Pterostylis genus."
