    "intro": "Polygala reducta, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Polygala reducta is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
