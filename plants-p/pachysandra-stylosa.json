    "intro": "Pachysandra stylosa, commonly known as the creeping pachysandra, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to China. It features dense, mat-forming growth with dark green, elliptical leaves that are glossy and slightly waxy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ground-covering ability. Pachysandra stylosa is relatively low maintenance and resistant to pests and diseases, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
