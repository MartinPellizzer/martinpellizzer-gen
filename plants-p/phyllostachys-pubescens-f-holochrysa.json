    "intro": "Phyllostachys pubescens f. holochrysa, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a varietal form of the silver bamboo, characterized by its striking golden-yellow culms. It is a clump-forming grass native to East Asia, particularly China, and is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often a lighter green than the culms, adding visual contrast. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This bamboo is relatively cold-hardy and can be propagated through division or rhizome cuttings."
