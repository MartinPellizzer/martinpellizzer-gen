    "intro": "Pinus hirtella, commonly known as the hirsute pine, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its short, twisted trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The needles are typically two to three inches long and have a slightly rough texture. It produces cones that are often covered in a sticky resin, which helps in seed dispersal. This plant is well adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in pine forests and rocky slopes."
