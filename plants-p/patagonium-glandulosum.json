    "intro": "Patagonium glandulosum, commonly known as the Patagonian glandular grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in loose panicles, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations in arid environments."
