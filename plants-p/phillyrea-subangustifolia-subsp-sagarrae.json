    "intro": "Phillyrea subangustifolia subsp. sagarrae, commonly known as the Sagarran Phillyrea, is a rare and endemic shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
