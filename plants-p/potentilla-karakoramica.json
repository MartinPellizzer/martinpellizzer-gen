    "intro": "Potentilla karakoramica, commonly known as the Karakoram cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough texture and a slightly serrated edge. Potentilla karakoramica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
