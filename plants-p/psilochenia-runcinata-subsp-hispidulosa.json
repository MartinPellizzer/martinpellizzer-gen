    "intro": "Psilochenia runcinata subsp. hispidulosa, commonly known as the hairy-leafed psilochenia, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, serrated leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its subspecies status highlights subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf texture and hair density. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
