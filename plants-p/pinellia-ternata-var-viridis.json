    "intro": "Pinellia ternata var. viridis, commonly known as green thread ginger, is a variant of the Pinellia genus native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces oval, yellowish-brown tubers that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Pinellia species, particularly in its leaf color and growth habit."
