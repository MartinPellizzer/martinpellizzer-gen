    "intro": "Phoradendron dolichocarpum, commonly known as the long-fruited mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family. It grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the southeastern United States. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. The plant's structure includes a root system that attaches to the host, allowing it to draw water and nutrients from the host tree."
