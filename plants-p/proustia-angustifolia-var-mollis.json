It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are soft to the touch, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes.
