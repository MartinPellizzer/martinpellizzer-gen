    "intro": "Polygala serpyllacea subsp. morisiana, commonly known as the Morisiana milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, delicate flowers that are usually pink or white in color. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
