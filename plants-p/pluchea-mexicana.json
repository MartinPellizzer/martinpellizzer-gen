It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are often mistaken for tomatoes due to their appearance. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and often reddish in color. Pluchea mexicana is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
