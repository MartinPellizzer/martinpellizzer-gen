It is a small, epiphytic orchid that thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree branches or rocks. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It has slender, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that help it conserve moisture. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring careful conservation efforts."
