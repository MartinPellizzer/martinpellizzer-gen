    "intro": "Pisum quadratum, commonly known as the four-leaf pea, is a rare and unique legume species characterized by its distinctive quadrifoliate leaves. This plant belongs to the Fabaceae family and is native to the Mediterranean region. It produces small, pod-like fruits containing one to three seeds, which are typically used for ornamental purposes due to its unusual foliage. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or containers. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic rarity and potential for hybridization with other pea species."
