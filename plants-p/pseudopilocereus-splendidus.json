    "intro": "Pseudopilocereus splendidus, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically nocturnal in bloom. Its root system is shallow and adapted to absorb moisture quickly from brief rainfall events. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
