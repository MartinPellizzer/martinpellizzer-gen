    "intro": "Prasophyllum albovirens, commonly known as the white-green leek orchid, is an endemic species found in the southeastern region of Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae, characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single spike of white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or loamy soils in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. It is a small plant, usually reaching heights of less than 30 centimeters, with a short rhizome and a single flowering stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
