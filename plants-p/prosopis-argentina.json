    "intro": "Prosopis argentina, commonly known as the Argentine mesquite, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional diets. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important species for soil stabilization and grazing. Its deep root system allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand drought conditions."
