    "intro": "Primula tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
