    "intro": "Platanthera graminea, commonly known as the grass piper, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated spike of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its reliance on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Platanthera graminea is an indicator species for undisturbed habitats and is often found in temperate regions of Europe and North America."
