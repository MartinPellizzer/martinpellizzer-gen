    "intro": "Pyrus elaeagrifolia f. taochia, commonly known as the Taochi pear, is a unique horticultural form of the pear tree. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring leaves that are elliptical with a serrated margin and a glossy, dark green upper surface. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are similar to regular pears. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for both its foliage and fruit."
