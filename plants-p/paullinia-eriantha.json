    "intro": "Paullinia eriantha, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but have a sour, acidic taste. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
