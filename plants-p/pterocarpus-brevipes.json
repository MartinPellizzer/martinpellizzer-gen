    "intro": "Pterocarpus brevipes, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, flat, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by hard, woody pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its dense, dark color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in furniture and musical instrument crafting. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered."
