    "intro": "Parsonsia linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flame vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Australia and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and clusters of bright orange to red tubular flowers. The plant is a vigorous climber, often found growing along fences, trees, or in rocky habitats. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure. Parsonsia linearis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
