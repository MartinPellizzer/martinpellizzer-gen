It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal and limestone areas. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant is also known for its ability to produce a resin that has been used historically for various purposes."
