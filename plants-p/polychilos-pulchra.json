    "intro": "Polychilos pulchra, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pinkish-white blooms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. The flowers emit a subtle fragrance, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths."
