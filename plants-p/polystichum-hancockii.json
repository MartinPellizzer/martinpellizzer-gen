    "intro": "Polystichum hancockii, commonly known as Hancock's sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to establish itself in nutrient-poor soils. Hancock's sword fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its elegant, architectural form."
