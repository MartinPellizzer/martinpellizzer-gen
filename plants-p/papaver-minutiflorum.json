    "intro": "Papaver minutiflorum, commonly known as the dwarf poppy, is a species of flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces smooth, green, ovate leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stem. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not as widely grown as other poppy species."
