    "intro": "Pinus culminicola var. remota, commonly known as the alpine limber pine, is a variant of the limber pine native to high-altitude regions of western North America. This subspecies is characterized by its slender, often contorted growth form, adapted to harsh alpine conditions. It typically grows on rocky slopes and cliffs, where it forms dense, wind-resistant stands. The needles are long and slender, with a bluish-green color, and the cones are small and often persist on the branches for many years. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
