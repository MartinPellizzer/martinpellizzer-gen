The leaves are typically opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It has been studied for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
