    "intro": "Portulaca zaffranii, commonly known as the golden moss or golden star, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia. It is a low-growing annual plant that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close in the heat of the day. Its leaves are succulent, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Portulaca zaffranii is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies for various ailments."
