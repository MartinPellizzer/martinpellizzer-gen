    "intro": "Polypodium abietinum, commonly known as the fir moss, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate forests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Polypodium abietinum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various small organisms."
