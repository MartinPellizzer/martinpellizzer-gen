    "intro": "Platantheroides magdalenensis, commonly known as the Magdalen marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Magdalen Islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that produces a single, showy, greenish-white flower. The plant thrives in wet, acidic bogs and requires specific environmental conditions to survive. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it is highly sensitive to habitat disturbance. Due to its limited distribution and ecological fragility, it is considered a vulnerable species."
