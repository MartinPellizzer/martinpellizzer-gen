    "intro": "Poa serpana, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spikelet that bears small, two-lobed florets. Poa serpana is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
