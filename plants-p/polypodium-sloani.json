    "intro": "Polypodium sloani, commonly known as the San Francisco fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with high humidity. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the growth of its foliage. The San Francisco fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
