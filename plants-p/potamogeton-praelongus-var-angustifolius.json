    "intro": "Potamogeton praelongus var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has long, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide, arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often found near the water surface. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in its native ecosystems."
