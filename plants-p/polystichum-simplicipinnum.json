    "intro": "Polystichum simplicipinnum, commonly known as the simple pinna fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features a tall, upright rhizome with dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into pinnate segments. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with simple, rounded pinnae that give the plant its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
