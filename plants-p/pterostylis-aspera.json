    "intro": "Pterostylis aspera, commonly known as the rough-leafed grass orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its leaves are rough and hairy, contributing to its common name. The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common feature among orchids."
