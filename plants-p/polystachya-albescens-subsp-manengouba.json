    "intro": "Polystachya albescens subsp. manengouba, commonly known as the Manengouba orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central Africa. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its erect, leafy stems and clusters of white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
