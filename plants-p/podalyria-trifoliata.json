    "intro": "Podalyria trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and features wiry, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a distinguishing feature. Podalyria trifoliata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens."
