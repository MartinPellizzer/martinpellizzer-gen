    "intro": "Phalaroides arundinacea, commonly known as soft rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetlands and moist soils in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm and has slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish or greenish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Soft rush is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
