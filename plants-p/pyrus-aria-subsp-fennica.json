It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, acidic soils in boreal and subarctic regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are typically green when mature. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks."
