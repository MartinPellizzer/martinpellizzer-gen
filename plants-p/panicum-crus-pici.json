    "intro": "Panicum crus-pici, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and elongated, slender leaves that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common weed in disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is often found in lawns, fields, and along roadsides."
