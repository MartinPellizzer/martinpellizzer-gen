    "intro": "Prunus avium proles semperflorens, commonly known as the perpetual flowering cherry, is a cultivar of the sweet cherry tree. It is characterized by its ability to produce flowers and fruit throughout the growing season, unlike typical cherry trees that bloom in spring. The plant features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to the landscape. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a smooth texture and a dark green color. The fruit is a small, sweet cherry that ripens in late summer, making it both ornamental and edible."
