    "intro": "Pneumatopteris brooksii, commonly known as the Brooks' water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has long, slender fronds that are typically divided into small, linear segments, aiding in its ability to spread through water. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Pneumatopteris brooksii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
