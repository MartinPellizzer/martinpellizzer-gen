    "intro": "Pyrus malus, commonly known as the apple tree, is a deciduous tree native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy white or pink flowers. The fruit, the apple, develops from the flower and is typically harvested in the fall. Apple trees are widely cultivated for their edible fruit and have been selectively bred for various traits such as size, color, and taste. They require well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth and fruit production."
