    "intro": "Polypodium morganii, commonly known as the Morgan's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, glossy fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
