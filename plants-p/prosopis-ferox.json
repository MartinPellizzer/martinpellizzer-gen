    "intro": "Prosopis ferox, commonly known as the screwbean tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its spiny branches and compound leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in hard, woody pods that can persist on the plant for years. Prosopis ferox is well adapted to drought and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
