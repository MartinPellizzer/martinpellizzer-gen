    "intro": "Polypodium gestasianum, commonly known as the Gestaian fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in distinct patterns. Polypodium gestasianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
