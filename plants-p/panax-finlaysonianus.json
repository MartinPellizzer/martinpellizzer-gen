    "intro": "Panax finlaysonianus, commonly known as the Philippine ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and yellowish-white flowers. The plant grows in dense, humid forests at high altitudes, often in shaded, moist environments. Its roots are valued for their medicinal properties, similar to other ginseng species. Due to over-harvesting and habitat loss, it is critically endangered and protected in several regions."
