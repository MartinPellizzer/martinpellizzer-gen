    "intro": "Phacelia oreopola, commonly known as the Sierra phacelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and meadows, thriving in full sun. Its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments. Phacelia oreopola plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
