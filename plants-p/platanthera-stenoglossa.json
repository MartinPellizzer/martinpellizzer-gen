    "intro": "Platanthera stenoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern in many regions."
