It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of large, showy florets. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers are often pink or purple, and they bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
