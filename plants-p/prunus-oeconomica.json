    "intro": "Prunus oeconomica, commonly known as the European blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue-black berries in late summer. These berries are rich in antioxidants and have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types and climates."
