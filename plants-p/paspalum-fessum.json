    "intro": "Paspalum fessum, commonly known as narrowleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Paspalum fessum is often found in open habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed areas."
