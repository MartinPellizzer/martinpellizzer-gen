    "intro": "Pinguicula obtusiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaved butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that are covered in a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in bogs or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
