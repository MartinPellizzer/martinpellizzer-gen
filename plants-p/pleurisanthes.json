    "intro": "Pleurisanthes, commonly known as the Chinese sand pear, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its fragrant, white to yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellow or orange fruits that are edible but not commonly cultivated for consumption. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Pleurisanthes is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
