    "intro": "Primula auricula f. monacensis, commonly known as the Monacense Primrose, is a rare and distinctive variant of the auricula primrose. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. This subspecies is native to the Alps and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils. Its foliage is typically more elongated and narrower compared to the typical form, and it is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in the wild."
