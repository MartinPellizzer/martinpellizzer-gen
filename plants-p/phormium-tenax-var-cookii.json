    "intro": "Phormium tenax var. cookii, commonly known as Cook's flax, is a striking ornamental plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its sword-shaped, dark green leaves that are often lined with red or purple markings. The plant produces tall, spiky flower stalks that bear showy, violet-blue bracts, which are not true flowers but serve as modified leaves. It is a hardy perennial that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its resilience and visual appeal make it a popular choice for both landscaping and horticultural collections."
