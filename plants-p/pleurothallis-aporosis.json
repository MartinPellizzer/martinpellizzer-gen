    "intro": "[WRONG START] Pleurotholis aporosis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
