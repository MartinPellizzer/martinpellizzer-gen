    "intro": "Pteris lucida, commonly known as the shining water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving them a glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Pteris lucida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
