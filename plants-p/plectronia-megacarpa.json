    "intro": "Plectronia megacarpa, commonly known as the giant seed-bearing plant, is a rare and distinctive species within the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces massive, woody fruits that can weigh several kilograms, containing numerous seeds enclosed in a fleshy, colorful pulp. Its leaves are broad and palmately lobed, contributing to its striking visual appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Plectronia megacarpa is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
