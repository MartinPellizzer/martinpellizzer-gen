    "intro": "Pinus mastersiana, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its dense, needle-like foliage that grows in pairs. The tree produces cones that are typically 3 to 5 centimeters long, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, dry climates and well-drained soils. This species is notable for its longevity and is often found in isolated populations across its limited range."
