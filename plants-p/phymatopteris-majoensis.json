    "intro": "Phymatopteris majoensis, commonly known as the Majo fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in Mexico and parts of the Caribbean. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
