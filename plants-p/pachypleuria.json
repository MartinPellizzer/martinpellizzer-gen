    "intro": "Pachypleuria, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plants typically have thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Pachypleuria species are native to southern Africa and are often found in rocky or sandy soils. They are valued for their ornamental beauty and ecological role in supporting nocturnal wildlife."
