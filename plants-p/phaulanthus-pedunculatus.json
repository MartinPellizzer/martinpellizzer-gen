    "intro": "Phaulanthus pedunculatus, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions by efficiently absorbing and storing water. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
