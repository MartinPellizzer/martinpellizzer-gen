    "intro": "Pinus pinaster var. lemoniana, commonly known as the lemon-scented pine, is a variant of the maritime pine native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinct lemon-like fragrance emitted from its leaves, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. The tree typically grows as a tall, straight-stemmed evergreen with a conical shape when young, developing a more irregular form with age. Its needles are slender, dark green, and often have a waxy coating, while its cones are woody and elongated. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in reforestation efforts due to its adaptability to various soil types."
