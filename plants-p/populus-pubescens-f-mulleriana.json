It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in temperate and subalpine climates. The plant exhibits a silver-gray pubescent underside on its leaves, which distinguishes it from other Populus species. It typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree with a rounded crown and smooth, pale bark. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
