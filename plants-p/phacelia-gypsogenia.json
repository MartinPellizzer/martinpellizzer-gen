It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often on gypsum soils. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of blue to purple flowers. It is adapted to dry conditions with a deep root system and minimal water requirements. Phacelia gypsogenia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
