    "intro": "Pyrus iranica, commonly known as the Iranian pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountains of Iran. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its spiny branches and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, yellow or green fruits that are typically edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture. Pyrus iranica is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
