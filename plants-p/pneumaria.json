    "intro": "Pneumaria, commonly known as the lungwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Plantaginaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive basal rosette of leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs and have a rough texture. The flowers, typically arranged in spikes, are usually purple or pink and bloom in late spring to early summer. Pneumaria species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in woodland or grassy areas. These plants are known for their medicinal properties, with some species historically used in herbal remedies."
