    "intro": "Pitcairnia firma, commonly known as the royal bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that can last for several months, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Pitcairnia firma is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
