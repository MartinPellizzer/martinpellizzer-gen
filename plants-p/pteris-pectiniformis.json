    "intro": "Pteris pectiniformis, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are divided into small, overlapping segments resembling a lace pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of spore-bearing fronds. Pteris pectiniformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
