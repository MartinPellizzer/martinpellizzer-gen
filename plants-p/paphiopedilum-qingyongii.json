It is characterized by its vibrant, waxy flowers that typically display a mix of yellow, green, and red hues. The plant has a unique lip structure, which is a defining feature of the Paphiopedilum genus, often resembling a pouch or a saddle. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
