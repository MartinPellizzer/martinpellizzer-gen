    "intro": "Prunus spinosa var. foecundissima, commonly known as the wild cherry or blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in hedgerows and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are white and appear in clusters, followed by the edible but tart berries. The species is notable for its hardiness and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
