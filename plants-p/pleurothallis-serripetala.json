    "intro": "Pleurothallis serripetala, commonly known as the sharp-toothed orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on tree branches or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green. Its flowers are often clustered in racemes and are adapted for pollination by small insects. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
