    "intro": "Pleiotaxis rogersii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access moisture deep in the soil. Pleiotaxis rogersii is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant in desert landscapes."
