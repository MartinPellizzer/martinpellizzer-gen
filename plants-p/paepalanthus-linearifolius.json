It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, upright stems and long, narrow leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
