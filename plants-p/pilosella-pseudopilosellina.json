    "intro": "Pilosella pseudopilosellina, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountains of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance and help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pilosella pseudopilosellina is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained environments."
