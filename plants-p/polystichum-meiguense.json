    "intro": "Polystichum meiguense, commonly known as the Mei Guan fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is native to China, particularly found in the mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. The plant features feather-like fronds that are dark green and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its ornamental value. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually in shaded environments. Polystichum meiguense thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
