    "intro": "Pteris angulosa, commonly known as the angle fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Pteris angulosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
