    "intro": "Pyrus malus plena, commonly known as the Flowering Crabapple, is a cultivar of the apple tree that is prized for its ornamental value. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant is a deciduous tree with a rounded, compact form and smooth, dark bark. Its foliage is typically glossy and deep green, providing visual interest throughout the growing season. While it is not typically used for fruit production, it is valued in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
