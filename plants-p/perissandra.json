    "intro": "Perissandra, commonly known as the sandpaper tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its rough, sandpaper-like texture on its leaves, which gives it its common name. Perissandra species typically have small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow. These plants are often used in traditional medicine and are also valued for their ornamental appeal."
