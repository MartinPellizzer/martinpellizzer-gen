    "intro": "Pelargonium inaequilobum, commonly known as the unequal-lobed geranium, is a species native to South Africa. It is a perennial herb with distinctive, irregularly lobed leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
