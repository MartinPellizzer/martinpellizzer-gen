    "intro": "Proboscidea diversifolia, commonly known as the diverse-horned orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescence that resembles a proboscis, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in a dense cluster. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
