    "intro": "Plagiobothrys scouleri var. hispidulus, commonly known as the hispid trailing filaree, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on rocky soils and open slopes. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is distinguished by its dense, hairy foliage and is often found in coastal and inland regions with well-drained soils."
