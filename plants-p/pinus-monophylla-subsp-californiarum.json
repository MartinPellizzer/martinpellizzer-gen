    "intro": "Pinus monophylla subsp. californiarum, commonly known as the California whitebark pine, is a subspecies native to the western United States. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its distinctive white bark and needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows in high-elevation areas, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its cones are serotinous, meaning they remain closed until triggered by heat from a fire, allowing seeds to be released. This adaptation aids in its regeneration in fire-prone ecosystems."
