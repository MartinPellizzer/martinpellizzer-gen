    "intro": "Penstemon verticillatus, commonly known as the whorled beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and cliffs. The plant features tall, branched stems with opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. Its showy, tubular flowers, which range in color from blue to purple, bloom in late spring to early summer. Penstemon verticillatus is valued in gardens for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
