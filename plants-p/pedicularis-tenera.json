    "intro": "Pedicularis tenera, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that resemble small monkeys. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing at high altitudes. Its vivid yellow petals and intricate floral structure make it a striking and rare ornamental plant."
