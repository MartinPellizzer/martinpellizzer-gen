    "intro": "Philodendron straminicaule, commonly known as the silver-veined philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves with prominent silvery veins that create a striking contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens."
