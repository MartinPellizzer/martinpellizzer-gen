    "intro": "Poa gunnii, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes where it forms dense mats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, Poa gunnii is also cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
