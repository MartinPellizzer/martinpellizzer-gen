    "intro": "Peperomia glabella, commonly known as the velvet leaf peperomia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green, velvety leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically hidden beneath the foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate moisture. Peperomia glabella is a low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for indoor cultivation."
