    "intro": "Phlomis persica, commonly known as Persian mullein, is a perennial herb native to the mountains of Central Asia. It features tall, erect stems covered in dense, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and often covered in a thick layer of soft, downy hairs. Phlomis persica is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a resilient plant in challenging conditions."
