    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 saxifragoides, commonly known as the African geranium, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, often with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom throughout the growing season. Native to South Africa, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value and adaptability contribute to its widespread cultivation in temperate climates."
