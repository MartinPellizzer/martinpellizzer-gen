    "intro": "Paeonia decomposita, commonly known as the decomposed peony, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring large, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces distinctive, elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
