    "intro": "Polycarpon anomalum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Its leaves are alternate and have a distinctive waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. This variant is notable for its adaptability to various soil types and its role in agricultural ecosystems as a weed."
