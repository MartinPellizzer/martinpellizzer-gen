    "intro": "Prunus pumila, commonly known as the dwarf cherry or rock cherry, is a small, deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 2 feet and features slender, arching branches covered in small, oval leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, bright red berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Prunus pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a garden setting."
