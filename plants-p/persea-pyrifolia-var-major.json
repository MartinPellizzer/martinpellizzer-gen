    "intro": "Persea pyrifolia var. major, commonly known as the giant persimmon, is a variant of the persimmon tree native to tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The tree produces orange to red fruit with a sweet, sometimes astringent flavor. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing before the leaves. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruit, though it is less commonly cultivated than other persimmon species."
