    "intro": "Portulaca nogalensis var. heterotricha, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, succulent annual that thrives in hot, dry environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, fleshy leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the morning. It is adapted to conserve water through its thick, waxy leaves and deep root system. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in desert landscapes."
