    "intro": "Pyrus canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian pear, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces small, edible pears that are typically harvested in the fall. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental and fruit-bearing plant in temperate climates. Pyrus canadensis is also valued for its historical use in horticulture and as a rootstock for other pear varieties."
