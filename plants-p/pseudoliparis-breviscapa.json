It is characterized by its short, fleshy stem and a crown of delicate, translucent tentacles that surround its oral disc. This species thrives in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocks or other substrates. Its simple yet elegant structure makes it an important part of marine ecosystems. Despite its small size, it plays a role in providing habitat and food for various small marine organisms."
