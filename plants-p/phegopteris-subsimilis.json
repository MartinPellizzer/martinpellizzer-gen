    "intro": "Phegopteris subsimilis, commonly known as the similar maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Phegopteris subsimilis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
