    "intro": "Pterostylis antennifera, commonly known as the antennate duckbill, is an orchid native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and narrow greenish-brown flower spike, which resembles a duck's bill. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often hidden among the foliage, making them difficult to spot. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors and requires a humid environment to thrive. Pterostylis antennifera is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
