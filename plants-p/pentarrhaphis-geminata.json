    "intro": "Pentarrhaphis geminata, commonly known as the twin-veined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often divided into pairs of pinnae, giving it its scientific name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves. Pentarrhaphis geminata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
