    "intro": "Poa vrangelica, commonly known as the Vrangeline grass, is a rare and endemic species native to the Russian Far East. It is a low-growing perennial grass with slender, dark green leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows and riverbanks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with pale green to brown hues, and it produces viable seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Poa vrangelica is considered a vulnerable species."
