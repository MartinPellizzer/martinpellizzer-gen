    "intro": "Plantago major var. pilgeri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a variant of the common plantain native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender spikes. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, roadsides, and other urban environments. This variant is closely related to other Plantago species and is valued for its medicinal properties and adaptability to various growing conditions."
