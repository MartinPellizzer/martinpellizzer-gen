    "intro": "Potentilla pallens, commonly known as the silver potentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps reflect sunlight in its alpine habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Potentilla pallens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
