    "intro": "Polypodium caribaeum, commonly known as the Carib rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Polypodium caribaeum plays an important role in the ecological balance of tropical rainforests by contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
