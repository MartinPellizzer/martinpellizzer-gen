It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in an alternate pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, followed by the development of berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
