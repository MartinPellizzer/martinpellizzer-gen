    "intro": "Paphiopedilum insigne var. moensii, commonly known as the Moensii Lady's Slipper, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, velvety petals and a prominent lip that resembles a slipper, which is a defining feature of the Paphiopedilum genus. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb and is known for its fragrant, pale pink to white flowers. It prefers shady, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
