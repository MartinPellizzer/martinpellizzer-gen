    "intro": "Plantago coronopus subsp. weldenii, commonly known as the coastal plantain, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes, where it tolerates salt spray and wind. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spikes. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in harsh, coastal environments. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
