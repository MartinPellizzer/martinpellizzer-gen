    "intro": "Phoradendron bolleanum subsp. hawksworthii, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and white, fragrant flowers. The plant relies on host trees, primarily Metrosideros species, for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy berries. This subspecies is of particular interest due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution within Hawaii."
