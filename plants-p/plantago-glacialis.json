    "intro": "Plantago glacialis, commonly known as the alpine plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to cold climates. It typically grows in alpine and arctic regions, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in a spike and bloom in early summer. This species is known for its resilience and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
