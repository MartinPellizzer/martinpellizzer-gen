    "intro": "Platanthera listeroides, commonly known as the yellow twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is a herbaceous plant with a short, horizontal rhizome and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a raceme of yellow, bilaterally symmetric flowers with a distinct lip. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodlands. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in many areas."
