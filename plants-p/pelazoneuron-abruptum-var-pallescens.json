    "intro": "Pelazoneuron abruptum var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale-leaved pelazoneuron, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its unique botanical features. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. The leaves are elongated and have a pale, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in humid conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in late spring to early summer. This variant is noted for its distinct morphology and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and speciation."
