    "intro": "Poa glauca var. debilis, commonly known as the blue grass or slender bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and a bluish-green coloration, which gives it its common name. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas."
