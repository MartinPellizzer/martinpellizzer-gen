    "intro": "Peltostigma guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan peltostigma, is a member of the Rhamnaceae family. It is a small, deciduous shrub native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are small, capsule-like structures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
