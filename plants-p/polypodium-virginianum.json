    "intro": "Polypodium virginianum, commonly known as the eastern cliff brake, is a fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in rocky, acidic soils and is often found on cliffs, rock walls, and woodland edges. Its spores are released from the sori, which are small, clustered structures on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium virginianum is a perennial plant that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in its preferred habitats."
