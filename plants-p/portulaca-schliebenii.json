    "intro": "Portulaca schliebenii, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas. Portulaca schliebenii is adapted to thrive in high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
