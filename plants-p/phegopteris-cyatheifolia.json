    "intro": "Phegopteris cyatheifolia, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a striking plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk that is covered in a fibrous, dark brown rind. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
