    "intro": "Psychotria capillacea, commonly known as the \"Cape Cod poison ivy\" or \"arrow poison plant,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with fine, hair-like structures along the edges. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It contains toxic alkaloids, such as scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which have been historically used by indigenous peoples for medicinal and ritualistic purposes. Psychotria capillacea thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along stream banks."
