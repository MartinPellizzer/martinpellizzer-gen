    "intro": "Pleroma ochypetalum, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright color and nectar-rich structure. Pleroma ochypetalum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
