    "intro": "Piptanthocereus, commonly known as the night-blooming cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. These plants are native to Mexico and are characterized by their spiny stems and nocturnal blooming habits. The flowers, which open at night, are typically white or pale pink and emit a strong fragrance to attract pollinators such as moths. Piptanthocereus species are adapted to arid environments, featuring succulent stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Their unique botanical features make them popular among cactus enthusiasts and botanists alike."
