    "intro": "Pitcairnia truncata, commonly known as the velvet leaf. It is a bromeliad native to Brazil, characterized by its rosette of dark green, velvety leaves that are often used in floral arrangements. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pitcairnia truncata is popular among collectors for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
