    "intro": "Pachynocarpus, commonly known as the rock cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are typically small, herbaceous species that often grow in rocky or arid environments. They are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, four-petaled flowers. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water. Pachynocarpus species are often found in temperate regions and are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
