    "intro": "Polypodium magellanicum, commonly known as the Southern Shield Fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
