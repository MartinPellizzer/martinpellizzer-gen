    "intro": "Parrya chitralensis, commonly known as the Chitral parrya, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Pakistan and northern India. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
