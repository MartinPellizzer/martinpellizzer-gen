    "intro": "Plectronia korrowalensis, commonly known as the Kowro Valley plectronia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Kowro Valley in South Africa. It is a small shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a specific microclimate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
