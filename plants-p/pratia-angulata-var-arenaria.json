    "intro": "Pratia angulata var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand pratia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to sandy coastal regions of southern Africa. It has small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sand dunes, making it an important species for coastal vegetation. It is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
