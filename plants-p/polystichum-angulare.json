    "intro": "Polystichum angulare, commonly known as the angular fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rigid, upright fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polystichum angulare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, feathery appearance."
