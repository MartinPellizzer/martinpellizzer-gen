    "intro": "Poa agassizensis, commonly known as the Agassiz\u2019s bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in wet environments and its tolerance to periodic flooding. Poa agassizensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and small mammals."
