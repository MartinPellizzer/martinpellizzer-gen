    "intro": "Pinus douglasii var. taxifolia, commonly known as the Douglas fir variety taxifolia, is a variant of the Douglas fir native to the western United States. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are longer and more slender compared to typical fir needles. The cones of this variety are typically larger and more elongated, with a distinctive shape that aids in seed dispersal. The tree has a tall, conical form with a straight trunk, making it a notable species in forest ecosystems. Its botanical features make it well adapted to its native habitat, which includes moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions."
