    "intro": "Pentacyphus lehmannii subsp. lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's pentacyphus, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, woody fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
