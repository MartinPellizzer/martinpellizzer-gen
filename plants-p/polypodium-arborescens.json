    "intro": "Polypodium arborescens, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species of fern characterized by its tall, tree-like structure. It features a central, unbranched stem that is covered in a thick, fibrous layer of old fronds. The plant produces fertile fronds that are shorter and more compact compared to the sterile, elongated fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. Polypodium arborescens is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
