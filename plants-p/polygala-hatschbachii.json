    "intro": "Polygala hatschbachii, commonly known as the Hatschbach's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Polygalaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in dry, harsh environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
