It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
