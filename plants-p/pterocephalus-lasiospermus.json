    "intro": "Pterocephalus lasiospermus, commonly known as the desert cowpea, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and hairy stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited moisture. Due to its resilience, it is often found in desert environments and is used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
