    "intro": "Pulicaria crispa subsp. fogensis, commonly known as the Foggy Crispweed, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which reflects its adaptation to harsh, sunny environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
