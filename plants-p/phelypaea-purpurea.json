    "intro": "Phelypaea purpurea, commonly known as the purple fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It thrives in shallow, still waters and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that often display a striking purple hue. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, forming dense colonies. Its spores are released into the air, allowing for reproduction in suitable moist environments. Phelypaea purpurea plays an important role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
