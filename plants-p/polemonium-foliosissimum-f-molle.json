    "intro": "Polemonium foliosissimum f. molle, commonly known as the soft-leaved Jacob's ladder, is a herbaceous perennial belonging to the Polemoniaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage is notably softer and more velvety compared to the typical form of Polemonium foliosissimum. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
