    "intro": "Pecluma choquetangensis, commonly known as the Choquetango pecluma, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its distinctive floral structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories, where it relies on specific soil conditions for optimal growth. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pecluma choquetangensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
