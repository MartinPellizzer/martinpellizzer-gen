    "intro": "Piper dilatatum f. longipilum, commonly known as the long-hair pepper, is a variant of the broadleaf pepper plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and the presence of long, slender hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into peppercorn-like berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. This ornamental and edible plant is valued for its unique appearance and mild peppery flavor."
