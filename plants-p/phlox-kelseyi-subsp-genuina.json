It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically blooms in early summer and prefers well-drained, rocky soils in full sun. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
